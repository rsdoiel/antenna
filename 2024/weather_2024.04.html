Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1036 AM CST Mon Jan 22 2024

Valid 221630Z - 231200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...South-central CONUS including coastal Texas...
Surface high pressure and cold stable conditions will exist over the
eastern half of the CONUS, but multiple low-amplitude mid-level
disturbances and a prevalent warm conveyor over the south-central
CONUS toward the Ozarks/Midwest will influence widespread showers
across that same region with continued elevated thunderstorm
potential especially across east/southeast Texas toward Louisiana
and the ArkLaTex. 

Weak surface-based destabilization should gradually occur near the
upper Texas coast, beginning this afternoon and more so tonight.
Within a favorable kinematic environment, a few stronger
near-surface-based storms could occur as early as this afternoon
across the upper Texas coast, but the overall severe thunderstorm
potential is still expected to remain low through tonight.

...Western States...
Showers and occasional lightning flashes will be possible from
portions of southwest Oregon and California into southern Arizona.
This convection will be associated with a pronounced mid-level
trough embedded within broader cyclonic flow, with steepening lapse
rates.

Mesoscale Discussion 0083
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0917 AM CST Mon Jan 22 2024

Areas affected...portions of eastern/northeastern IL...northern
IN...far southern MI and far northwest OH

Concerning...Freezing rain 

Valid 221517Z - 221915Z

SUMMARY...Light to moderate freezing rain is expected through the
morning hours with rates of 0.01-0.03 in/hr possible. Some
mixed-phase precipitation is also possible early.

DISCUSSION...As of 15 UTC, regional radar mosaic imagery and surface
observations showed a broad area of light to moderate wintry
precipitation across parts of northeastern IL. Over the last hour,
automated reports of unknown precipitation type and freezing rain
have gradually become more numerous as the precipitation has
expanded over an air mass with surface temperatures in the mid to
upper 20s F. Driven primarily by low-level warm advection, light to
moderate precipitation is expected to continue to move
east/northeast this morning. Light snow has been observed across
parts of southwest lower MI and northwest IN. However, observed and
modified model soundings show an elevated warm nose of 1-2 C between
1-2 km AGL will gradually advect northeastward over the next few
hours. While some snow and sleet are possible ahead of the main area
of precipitation, gradually deepening of the elevated warm layer to
near 600-800 m will favor a transition to predominately freezing
rain.

Rain rates of 0.01-0.03 in/hr are possible above favorable surface
temperatures for rapid ice accretion. The most likely corridor for
impactful freezing rain appears to be from northeastern IL into
northwest IN and far southwest lower MI through this morning. Hi-res
CAM guidance has been poor thus far in handling the evolution of the
precipitation field. While low-level warm advection may wane
slightly through the day, observed low and mid-level ascent appears
strong enough to continue to support precipitation into the early
afternoon. Given the cold surface temperatures and melting layer
aloft, freezing rain appears likely.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1016 AM CST Mon Jan 22 2024

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 01/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1020 PM CST Sun Jan 21 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain low today. Much of the
northern US remains under snow pack with cool and moist conditions
to continue across the western and central US. Recent
precipitation over the last 7-14 days has resulted in high fuel
moisture across much of the CONUS, further limiting potential for
wildfire spread.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0650 AM CST Mon Jan 22 2024

Valid 221300Z - 231200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...Discussion...
A broad zone of amplifying cyclonic flow is forecast to expand
eastward to eventually include the western 2/3 of the country, while
ridging builds northward across the eastern U.S. through the period.

Within the cyclonic flow field expanding eastward with time,
multiple small-scale troughs/vorticity maxima will travel eastward
in an arcing manner through the background flow.  Associated ascent,
coupled with abundant Pacific moisture, will support widespread
precipitation.

While cold/stable low-level air will continue to prevail over the
eastern half of the country where the influence of surface high
pressure remains, an area of thunderstorms -- largely elevated atop
the low-level cold air -- will continue, from portions of Texas
across the Arklatex region.  Storms spreading northeastward across
the Texas Coastal Plain today will encounter an area of weak
near-surface-based CAPE along immediate coastal areas.  With the
background kinematic environment exhibiting favorably strong/veering
flow with height, this may result in the evolution of a couple of
stronger storms for a brief time late this morning/early this
afternoon -- and possibly a brief window of non-zero severe
potential.  However, at this time risk does not appear sufficient to
introduce even a lowest-end (5% wind/2% tornado) risk area.

Meanwhile in the West, showers and occasional lightning flashes will
be possible from portions of central and southern California into
southern Arizona.  This convection will be associated with a rather
pronounced mid-level trough embedded within broader cyclonic flow --
and an associated mid-level jet -- digging southeastward out of the
eastern Pacific into the southwestern states through the period. 
Severe weather is not expected.
