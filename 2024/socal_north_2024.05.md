“I Saw the TV Glow” is breaking through the static of the horror genre.
After making their narrative film debut at Sundance 2021 with their lo-fi horror film “We’re All Going to the World’s Fair,” writer-director Jane Schoenbrun returned to this year’s festival with “I Saw the TV Glow.” The filmmaker’s A24-produced sophomore entry centers on lonely teenagers Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine) who find solace in their favorite television show, “The Pink Opaque.”
Smith, Lundy-Paine and cast member Ian Foreman spoke with the Daily Bruin’s Graciana Paxton at the Sundance Film Festival about the ways in which the coming-of-age horror explores media obsessions, isolation and identity.

date: 2024-01-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

<em>This post was updated Jan. 28 at 11:38 p.m.&#160;</em>

“Aday and Devin really changed the rhythm of the game,” said coach Mick Cronin.
