## Sundance 2024: ‘I Saw the TV Glow’ actors discuss film’s script, connections to upbringing

date: 2024-01-29, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

“I Saw the TV Glow” is breaking through the static of the horror genre.
After making their narrative film debut at Sundance 2021 with their lo-fi horror film “We’re All Going to the World’s Fair,” writer-director Jane Schoenbrun returned to this year’s festival with “I Saw the TV Glow.” The filmmaker’s A24-produced sophomore entry centers on lonely teenagers Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine) who find solace in their favorite television show, “The Pink Opaque.”
Smith, Lundy-Paine and cast member Ian Foreman spoke with the Daily Bruin’s Graciana Paxton at the Sundance Film Festival about the ways in which the coming-of-age horror explores media obsessions, isolation and identity.
