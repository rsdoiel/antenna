<h2 id="updating-microsoft-secure-boot-keys">Updating Microsoft Secure
Boot keys</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft, in collaboration with our ecosystem partners, is preparing
to roll out replacement certificates that’ll set new Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface (UEFI) Certificate Authorities (CAs) trust anchors in
Secure Boot for the future. Look out for Secure Boot database updates
rolling out in phases to add trust for the new database (DB) and Key
Exchange Key (KEK) certificates. This new DB update is available as an
optional servicing update for all Secure Boot enabled devices from
February 13, 2024. ↫ SochiOgbuanya This update will replace the Windows
8-era certificates, set to expire in 2026, with new ones.</p>

the internet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>The robots.txt file governs a give and take; AI feels to many like
all take and no give. But there’s now so much money in AI, and the
technological state of the art is changing so fast that many site owners
can’t keep up. And the fundamental agreement behind robots.txt, and the
web as a whole — which for so long amounted to “everybody just be cool”
— may not be able to keep up either. ↫ David Pierce for The Verge
Another thing “AI” does not respect.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
VSBHDA provides SoundBlaster emulation for HDA (and AC97/SBLive). It is
Japheth’s fork of crazii’s SBEMU driver. This one works with an
unmodified HDPMI32i, making it compatible with HX. VSBHDA supports HDA
(Intel’s High Definition Audio), Intel ICH / nForce, VIA VT82C686,
VT8233/35/37, and VIA VT82C686, VT8233/35/37. It emulates SoundBlaster
1.0, 2.0, Pro, Pro2, 16 in 8-bit, 16-bit, mono, stereo, and high-speed
modes.

<p>Using two of the agency’s X-ray telescopes, researchers were able to
zoom in on a dead star’s erratic behavior as it released a bright, brief
burst of radio waves. What’s causing mysterious bursts of radio waves
from deep space? Astronomers may be a step closer to providing one

I’m getting good at it. Yesterday I did that with the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/13.html#a214721">piece</a> about
President Biden and how he probably would rather be doing anything than
be President, for a mostly thankless country, at age 81. I imagine he
has great-grandchildren he’d like to get to know. Maybe a book or two to
read, maybe one to write. To get his affairs in order. At age 68 I’m
trying to shed responsibility as much as possible. It’s prudent, and has
a point. When I was 25 I wanted to take over the world. Now I’d just
like to feel good. As you get older you are capable of more depth of
feeling, in some ways, and grow more numb in others. I spent time with
my father at 80, his last year. He was always a curious man, wanting to
learn about anything new, but in his last days he wasn’t curious. No
ambition. But he seemed okay with it, even happy at times (possibly due
in part to the morphine he was allowed). Anyway, it’s always interesting
to see where people react to what among the different social web
networks. And in this case, the most flow came from
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/111926409460785756">Mastodon</a>,
by far. I would not have predicted that. And it’s good to see, that
interesting ideas and perspective may have more of a future outside the
networks operated by the billionaire tech companies.</p>

the relationship between the people running websites and the people

It’s a great piece and the timing is convenient for me personally
because just the other day I emailed the lovely people at The Browser

<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a slow morning. I had my two cups of coffee, ate my pancakes with
plum jam, spent time online reading Mastodon, talked to my wife about
wannabe-axe murderers on Swiss trains, looked up stuff about
<a href="https://www.tax-the-rich.eu/">taxing the rich</a>…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve been working on Oddmu again. My goal is to be able to reproduce the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/">Campaign Wiki</a> setup:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
people can get a “space” for their site by signing up in some way
</li>
<li>
they can make changes to the look and feel of their site (change the
headers, footers, colours, i.e. make changes to both the HTML template
and the CSS)
</li>
<li>
feeds, list of changes and all that are limited to their site
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using Oddmu would also result in the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
sites are no longer publically editable (which isn’t a requirement for
such spaces like role-playing game campaigns)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Oddmu now has the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
when editing pages in a subdirectory, the <code>index</code> and
<code>changes</code> page in the same directory are updated (instead of
the root directory)
</li>
<li>
when HTML templates exist in the same directory, those are used instead
of the templates in the root directory
(e.g. <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ</a>)
</li>
<li>
when uploading a HTML template, it is loaded immediately (no more server
restart)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once I had this implemented using a library that watches the filesystem
for changes, I realized that I could use the same feature to index new
pages. This brings me closer to having online and offline writing
feature equivalence: Using the web site to create a page should be
equivalent to writing a page elsewhere and uploading it to the site via
rsync. (Offline you can use the <code>oddmu notify</code> command to add
links to <code>index</code>, <code>changes</code> and hashtag pages.)
</p>
<p>
I think I’m getting close!
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a>
</p>
<p>
Also, code complexity is through the roof, now. All the global maps
aren’t thread-safe so they need mutexes. There’s a weird Heisenbug I
have where I run the test suite and then <code>view.html</code> is gone.
The next test run then fails, of course. Thinking it was related to the
order of tests, I started running <code>go test -shuffle on</code> and
found a plethora of <em>other</em> bugs. And I’ve seen at least two
occasions where I noticed the disappearing <code>view.html</code> bug,
noted the shuffle id, reran the test with that id, got the error again,
tried for a third time, and then tests passed. So… it must be a race
condition of some sort.
</p>
<p>
How aggravating.
</p>
<p>
Maybe something got lost, with that last set of changes.
</p>
<p>
I do feel, however, that I’ve found a lot of bugs… Just now, for
example, to help prevent Oddmu from showing any directories or files
with a path segment starting with a period…
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-02-14</strong>. I need to think about an archive handler
that allows you to get a zip file for the current directory. (I guess
zip files are more accessible than .tar.gz files? Like, for Windows and
macOS…
</p>
<p>
And the archive needs to take
<a href="2024-02-14-oddmu-bug">ODDMU_FILTER</a> into account!

<p>
Done. ✔️

<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: Status-Q blog</p>
<p>The idea that electric cars are a serious fire risk is one that has
established itself in people’s minds, chiefly because such headlines
increase advertising revenue for newspaper editors.   If you can’t get a
scare story with ‘Elon Musk’ in the title, at least try to include some

<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-14 Oddµ bug maybe
</h1>
<p>
I had a site where an entire subdirectory was private. Nobody but the
author could read or write those pages. I had configured Apache to
require authentication for this subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
The config looked a bit like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/(edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|view/secret)/&quot;&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Password Required&quot;
  AuthUserFile /home/oddmu/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
Note the addition of <code>view/secret</code>.
</p>
<p>
But yesterday I realized that you can run a search in the root. Such a
search includes all the pages in subdirectories, and so Oddmu served an
extract of the pages in the “secret” subdirectory. Adding
<code>|search/secret</code> to the <code>LocationMatch</code> doesn’t
help.
</p>
<p>
I had to decide whether to disable search all together, or disable the
search of subdirectories, or add a new feature.
</p>
<p>
I added a new feature.
</p>
<p>
It is tied to an environment variable called <code>ODDMU_FILTER</code>.
It matches the directory being searched and the directory where the
search starts. If the directory doesn’t match, the pages returned must
also not match; if the directory does match, the pages returned must
also match.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example of three pages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
/a
</li>
<li>
/public/b
</li>
<li>
/secret/c
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The environment variable is set: <code>ODDMU_FILTER=^secret/</code> –
what happens now?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you search from the root (doesn’t match the filter), then only pages
a and b are searched (they also don’t match the filter).
</li>
<li>
If you search from /public (doesn’t match the filter), then only page b
is searched (also doesn’t match the filter). This behaviour is unchanged
from before. Searches start with the directory the user is looking at.
</li>
<li>
If you search from /secret (matches the filter), then only page c is
searched (also matches the filter). This, too, is unchanged from before.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Naturally, you still need to change to the web server config for the
actual authentication to happen:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/(edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|view/secret|search/secret)/&quot;&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Password Required&quot;
  AuthUserFile /home/oddmu/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
I hope I got it right! It’s also documented in the
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-apache.5">oddmu-apache(5)</a> man page.

downsizes as it refocuses on Firefox and AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Specifically, Mozilla plans to scale back its investment in a number
of products, including its VPN, Relay and, somewhat remarkably, its
Online Footprint Scrubber, which launched only a week ago. Mozilla will
also shut down Hubs, the 3D virtual world it launched back in 2018, and
scale back its investment in its mozilla.social Mastodon instance. The
layoffs will affect roughly 60 employees. Bloomberg previously reported
the layoffs. Going forward, the company said in an internal memo,
Mozilla will focus on bringing “trustworthy AI into Firefox.” To do so,
it will bring together the teams that work on Pocket, Content and AI/Ml.
↫ Frederic Lardinois for TechCrunch I’d like to remind everyone that
I’ve been warning the Linux world about the precarious, uncertain future
of Firefox for years now. The single most important desktop Linux
application is in a death spiral and entirely dependent on free Google
money. Not a good base to work from. With today’s news, I only feel
strengthened in my conviction that the major desktop projects in the
Linux world need to come together in a serious manner to discuss the
establishment of a browser project optimised for Linux. Pick an engine,
let the GNOME and KDE developers build a native UI on top, and take
matters into your own hands. If you can build the two best desktop
environments in desktop computing today, you can build a first-class
browser together. This is existential.</p>

<p>Microsoft plans to make Copilot AI inseparable from Windows. After
releasing Copilot for Windows 11 and 10 and adding it to Microsoft apps,
you can now use Copilot AI in Notepad to get simplified explanations.
You can install the Notepad app update via the Microsoft Store to use
this feature, but remember, it only works in Dev or Canary channels.
Notepad version 11.2401.25.0 adds the “Explain with Copilot” option in
its context menu. After highlighting a chunk of text (sentences, code
snippets, etc), right-click and select the “Explain with Copilot”
option. Or you can press the Ctrl + E shortcut to invoke this feature. ↫

for executing 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels will be retained through
at least the lifetime of the stable/16 branch if not longer. (There is
currently no plan to remove support for 32-bit binaries on 64-bit
kernels.) ↫ John Baldwin on freebsd-announce I don’t think this is too

<p>Who wouldn’t want to run a UNIX-like operating system on their NES or
Famicom? Although there’s arguably no practical reason for doing so,
decrazyo has cobbled together a working port of Little Unix (LUnix),
which was originally written for the Commodore 64 and 128 by Daniel
Dallmann. The impetus for this project was initially curiosity, but when
decrazyo saw that someone had already written a UNIX-like OS for the
6502 processor, it seemed apparent that the NES was too similar to the
C64 to not port it. ↫ Maya Posch for Hackaday This is peak

<h2 id="how-to-get-the-retro-wordart-back-in-microsoft-word">How to get
the retro WordArt back in Microsoft Word</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Graphic design is my passion so naturally I love the vintage, 1990s
WordArt. This was a feature in Microsoft Word that allowed you to create
timeless “3D” renderings of any text you wanted. It was perfection, but
for some reason Microsoft overhauled the feature in the late 2000s,
basically ruining it. These are a soulless simulacrum of the WordArt of
yore. The true WordArt remains, however, embedded deep in the code of
Microsoft Word itself. But some things that should not have been
forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for
twenty years WordArt passed out of all knowledge.  But it can be found
again. ↫ Justin Pot at Popular Science I had no idea this stuff was
still in there, but I guess it makes sense – people absolutely adored
this stuff, and it was all over the place for a very long time. You
would see it in restaurants, hotels, schools, stores, everywhere – from
high-end, luxury places to bargain basements. Now that I think about it,
I’m not at all surprised it’s still accessible.</p>

<p>I grew up primarily with the Commodore 64, where if you wanted to do

even a little TMS9900. I like assembly languages and how in control of
the CPU you feel writing in one. But you know what would make me not
like an assembly language? One that was contrived and not actually the
CPU it was running on. And you know what would make me like it even
less? If it were kneecapped, convoluted and limited without even proper
I/O facilities. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research Everything you ever

<p>This is what I imagine we all yearn for, for someone to really know
us before we die. Okay if it can’t be other people, at least let it be a
machine. Something like preserving a brain. Wouldn’t it be great to know
that when you’re gone, the essential you, even if it doesn’t include
your consciousness, persists? You could visit a person like you visit a

<h2 id="on-climbing-and-design">On climbing and design</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I don’t climb, I am not a climber, I don’t have interest in becoming
one. I do happen to have a
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ivanmoreale/">brother</a> though. And
he’s a climber. And if you know anything about climbers is that they’re
a bit obsessed with the sport. And as a result of that I’m becoming a
climber by proximity. I have absolutely no intention of practicing the
sport but I do enjoy watching it as a sport and I also enjoy consuming
content related to it. Mainly because climbers climb in gorgeous places
and I love nature. Anyway my brother also happens to be a graphic
designer and it was only a matter of time before the two things
collided. Well, it finally happened:
<a href="https://621.design">621.design</a>
</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with">

</div>
</figure>
<p>
The first series of climbing inspired t-shirts are available to be
purchased after WAY TOO LONG! I’m already tired of hearing about this
project but I’m happy that they’re finally out in the wild. Just to be
clear, I am not involved with this. I’m just doing my part and let you
know that these exist because who knows, maybe some of you out there are
into climbing.
</p>
<p>
Now, I do have one of those T-shirts sitting on my desk this very
moment. It’s the <a href="https://621.design/products/climb">Climb</a>,
size L. If you want it, you can sign up to my
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">One a Month</a> and then send
me a message. I’m gonna send it to the first one who claims it and will
throw in something else at random in the package. No drugs I promise
you. I might add a book in there or maybe a stick from the woods. Still
don’t know but there’s going to be something.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, <a href="https://621.design">621.design</a>, also on
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/621.design/">Instagram </a>. Go tell
my brother that these took WAY TOO LONG to come out.

Not really pleased with how today’s scene is going. I feel like I had
good ideas for it two weeks ago, but I didn’t write it then, because I
still hadn’t finished the previous scenes 😖 Now I’m scrambling a bit –
“Oh, this bit of dialogue was in it, right?” and it just doesn’t feel
cohesive. In future I need to take notes, no matter how much I think I’m
“just about” to reach a scene, anyway.

<h2 id="ed-pentz-accepts-the-2024-niso-miles-conrad-award">Ed Pentz
accepts the 2024 NISO Miles Conrad Award</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Great news to share: our Executive Director, Ed Pentz, has been selected
as the 2024 recipient of the Miles Conrad Award from the USA’s National
Information Standards Organization (NISO). The award is testament to an
individual’s lifetime contribution to the information community, and we
couldn’t be more delighted that Ed was voted to be this year’s
well-deserved recipient.
</p>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap align-right">
<span>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/staff/ed17-720px.png" width="100%"/>
</figure>
<p></span></p>
</div>
<p>
During the <a href="https://niso.plus" target="_blank">NISO Plus
conference</a> this week in Baltimore, USA, Ed accepted his award and
delivered the 2024 Miles Conrad lecture, reflecting on how far open
scholarly infrastructure has come, and the part he has played in this at
Crossref and through numerous other collaborative initiatives.
</p>
<p>
Established in 1965, the Miles Conrad Award gives recognition to those
who’ve made substantial contributions to the information community over
a lifetime. Named after the founder of the National Federation of
Abstracting and Indexing Services (NFAIS)—an association that since
merged with NISO—the award encourages innovation in content management
and dissemination. Over the years, leaders and innovators who have
significantly influenced the field of information exchange have been
honored with the award. Ed has joined
<a href="https://www.niso.org/awards/MCA" target="_blank">an illustrious
group</a>!
</p>
<p>
Ed’s leadership in collaboration and diplomacy has led to Crossref’s
success in making research objects more accessible and useful to a wide
global audience, including publishers, researchers, funders, societies,
libraries, and more. Crossref’s founding purpose is stated as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“To promote the development and cooperative use of new and innovative
technologies to speed and facilitate scientific and other scholarly
research”.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Acknowledging his privilege as a Western, university-educated, white
man, which he comments has helped his career, Ed prioritises
collaboration, open communication, teamwork, and equity in creating a
positive, trusted environment that has brought together a diverse team
of 49 colleagues from 11 countries. The organisation’s culture allows
everyone to grow and contribute to the mission of a connected
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus">research
nexus</a> by including and developing solutions for community members
across the globe.
</p>
<p>
Before his journey with Crossref, Ed held a number of roles at Harcourt
Brace, including launching Academic Press’s first online journal. This
experience led to his involvement with the DOI-X pilot project, which
became the foundation for Crossref. Since its launch in 2000, under his
leadership, Crossref has become an important component of the research
ecosystem, an open scholarly infrastructure with nearly 20,000 members
across more than 150 countries. Crossref is now the main source of
&gt;155 million records about all kinds of research objects and this
open metadata registry is relied upon by thousands of tools and services
across the whole research system.
</p>
<p>
Ed’s influence is also evident throughout the wider world of open
scholarly infrastructure; aside from establishing Crossref, he
co-founded <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR</a> and was a
founding member of
<a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a>, where he also
served as board Chair. Further, he has engaged with the community by
holding various advisory positions, including the
<a href="https://www.doi.org/" target="_blank">DOI Foundation</a>, the
Digital Object Naming Authority (DONA), and the Coalition for Diversity
in Scholarly Publishing (C4DISC).
</p>
<p>
Ed also emphasised that the long-term success of community initiatives
lies in patience and the ability to agree on high-level principles of
purpose and governance, which oil the wheels of collaboration, encourage
participation, and enable more progressive change that builds and lasts
over time. He says, “to solve collective problems it takes collaboration
and diplomacy, bringing together a group of stakeholders, balancing
their different concerns, building trust, and reaching consensus.”
</p>
<p>
The adoption of the
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org" target="_blank">Principles
of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>, along with (so far) 14
other organisations, was a key
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/posi/">turning point for
Crossref</a>, Ed said, and one which has already paved the way for more
openness of key metadata for the community, including references and
retractions, as well as closer partnerships with many of the other POSI
adoptees, given their shared understanding and experience.
</p>
<p>
Referencing the current “peak hype” around artificial intelligence (AI),
Ed points to the challenge of research integrity and the “growing field
of science sleuthing” as a forthcoming area that Crossref and open
metadata may help tackle at scale, including through Crossref’s
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/research-integrity">Integrity
of the Scholarly Record (ISR) Program</a> and—of course—community-wide
collaboration.
</p>
<p>
In concluding his talk, Ed describes his hopes and dreams for scholarly
communications in the future. He would like to see more balance in
diversity in the leadership of open scholarly infrastructure, extended
integrations among the various foundational infrastructures, and a fully
connected system where the scholarly record is inclusive globally.
</p>
<h4 id="ed-on-behalf-of-all-your-proud-colleagues-at-crossref-thank-you-and-congratulations">
Ed, on behalf of all your proud colleagues at Crossref, thank you and
congratulations!

<p>
I just found myself writing in a
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C3RBrhlJfgb">tweet on
Threads</a> that the news industry has contempt for its readers that AI
tools don’t have.
</p>
<p>
Actually the AIs also have a way better attitude about the truth than
Wikipedia does (yes I know Wikipedia is a Ouija board, that the very
worst people control).
</p>
<p>
We weren’t worried about the rise of fascism and the destruction of our
ecology, but we were worried about preserving jobs for supposed
truth-tellers who think we deserve garbage and don’t disappoint.

and PiDog which both used a Raspberry Pi as their brains. In contrast
the Mars Rover uses an Arduino Uno for its smarts. The Arduino is

<p>
A couple of weeks ago, I was chatting with one of my Idist friends, and
I was venting about one of my brothers-in-law, who is insufferable. They
asked me, “In English, do you also say ‘brother-in-law’ for those men
who think they know everything, but in fact they just parrot what they
hear, mostly antiquated, masculinist ideas? In Spain we call such men
‘cuñados’, even when they’re not literally our brothers-in-law…”
</p>
<p>
And I was like, “omg no, I’ve never heard that in English, but that’s
brilliant. I love it!” It is a <em>perfect</em> description of this
brother-in-law, that’s for sure. Clearly, insufferable brothers-in-law
are a phenomenon that transcends borders.

<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
First housekeeping post of 2024. Hope you all had a great beginning of
the year. As usual, a couple of things in no particular order:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> is about to
hit 25 interviews. There’s 52 weeks in a year so we’re almost half way
through year one. I’m happy to see that people are enjoying the series.
Makes me so happy.
</li>
<li>
Running Minimalissimo is fun. I’ve already coded a few things for the
site—a
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/books-and-a-new-navigation">new
navigation</a>, a new
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/stream">stream</a> section
and also a new books page—and I have plenty of other things I want to
do.
</li>
<li>
My <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">one a month
experiment</a> is a tiny success. Kind people are still out there and I
think it’s important to try support a more sane web in a sustainable
way.
</li>
<li>
I’m hosting the
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb
Carnival this month</a>. You can find the first 15 submissions at the
link above and you have time until February 28th to send yours.
</li>
<li>
I’m redesigning my blog. It’s not a true redesign, it will feel very
familiar if you visited this site over the past 5 or 6 years. Structure
will stay pretty much the same but I felt the need to tweak a few things
here and there. I’m also going to reintroduce a web font. I was in my
20s the last time I used one on this site. Gonna be fun.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that’s all I have for this February housekeeping. As always my inbox
is open if you want to get in touch. Have a great day.

<h2 id="one-way-is-always-better-than-two">One way is always better than
two</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Most Hacker News threads devolve into people talking about
personalities, not about tech stuff. But yesterday’s
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39324847">thread</a> about
OPML was the rare exception, until someone who says they like me (I
guess) said something personal and ugly.
</p>
<p>
I wonder why after all this time we can’t see how pointless it is to
have opinions about people, esp online. Everything you hear is passed
through someone else’s filters, so you’re getting a huge dose of their
personality along with a sliver of insight into the person they’re
talking about.
</p>
<p>
And don’t forget to factor in that sometimes when someone has put an
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">obstacle</a>
in the way of big companies, you can earn favor inside those companies
by scandalizing the person whose work they object to. There was a lot of
that happening as RSS crossed paths with some very big and rich
companies with lots of employees, and an interest in appearing to
interop without the cost of interop.
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried to add formats, protocols and software to the mix, always
trying to compromise. It’s not mentioned in the Wikipedia page on RSS
that I had a format that does what RSS does, a year before it existed,
but I gave it up so that Netscape and UserLand would build on the same
format, RSS.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t invent RSS. I did something much greater, I compromised. We had
the leading blogging software at the time, and Netscape had the feeds of
four credible news orgs. When you put them together, that turned out to
be huge power. We eventually pulled in all of social media and all of
professional publishing into one format. Ask anyone who was active at
the time. The blogging world adopted RSS in an instant, in 1999 and
2000. And in 2002, when the NYT adopted it, again, in an instant the
entire news world all of a sudden all had RSS feeds. You can see it in
the steady stream of announcements in the archive of
<a href="http://scripting.com/">this blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
BTW there was someone brilliant at Netscape who saw our compromise and
responded with more compromise. Their next version of RSS had some of
the features we had left behind in our format. We never asked them to do
that, they just figured it out. Collaboration is something that requires
two, one person can’t collaborate on their own. I know that sounds
ridiculous, but sometimes people don’t look for the other party who made
compromise possible.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think even the people who were closest to it at the time
understood the move. And I don’t think very many appreciate the power
that comes from being the one who throws in the towel on their pet
project to attain unity.
</p>
<p>
One way of doing something is always better than two. That’s just a
restatement of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle#:~:text=It%20is%20often%20reworded%20as,an%20early%20specification%20of%20TCP.">Postel’s
Postulate</a>. Be conservative in what you send.
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t just apply to you, it applies to all of us collectively.
Every time you add something that already exists we’re all going to pay
for it.
</p>
<p>
If you think that saying this makes me
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cantankerous">cantankerous</a> –
well, I say okay – but you’re wrong because it’s generous and brilliant
to push back when people add complexity. Of course people don’t like to
hear they’re doing something wrong, but when it comes to accumulating
complexity debt unnecessarily, well imho you have to listen to that.
Complexity is a force against interop.
</p>
<p>
We should be looking for opportunities to work together to create
something greater than anything any one of us can create.

history of all Windows UI frameworks and libraries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>The official way to create user interfaces for the Windows operating
system changed quite a lot of times during the last years. Microsoft
created and (partially or fully) abadoned a lot of APIs which where
intended to replace the respective previous ones. They changed names and
ways how it’s supposed to be done a few times, and left a lof of
developers confused. Here is a small historical overview. ↫ Nikolaus
Gebhardt If you’re ever wondering how we ended up at a situation where,
on the desktop and in Explorer, context menus have their own context
menus, well, this is why.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-x.org-and-wayland-in-one-paragraph">The state of
X.org and Wayland in one paragraph</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Wayland and X.org are both part of freedesktop. Whatever maintenance
is still happening on X.org is mostly being done by people who primarily
work on Wayland. There isn’t some kind of holy war going on between The
Wayland Developers who want to kill X.org, and The X.org Developers who
believe it is great and want to keep it. They’re nearly all the same
people, and they all want X.org to die. AFAIK there isn’t anybody who is
actually clamoring to <em>do the work of maintaining X.org
upstream</em>. There are people who don’t want it to die because Wayland
doesn’t yet have the features they need or the NVIDIA proprietary driver
doesn’t work well on Wayland or whatever, but AFAIK, none of those
people is actually volunteering to maintain X.org long-term. ↫ Adam
Williamson There’s really no clearer summary of the current state of
affairs than this.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-fedora-atomic-desktops">Introducing Fedora Atomic
Desktops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>We are happy to announce the creation of a new family of Fedora Linux
spins: Fedora Atomic Desktops! As Silverblue has grown in popularity,
we’ve seen more of our mainline Fedora Linux spins make the jump to
offer a version that implements rpm-ostree. It’s reached the point where
it can be hard to talk about all of them at the same time. Therefore
we’ve introduced a new brand that will serve to simplify how we discuss
rpm-ostree and how we name future atomic spins. ↫ Joseph Gayoso for
Fedora Magazine You can get pretty much any major desktop environment as
an rpm-ostree (inaccurately referred to as ‘immutable’) version of
Fedora, so it makes sense to standardise the naming scheme.</p>

id="accidentally-making-windows-vanish-in-my-old-fashioned-unix-x-environment">Accidentally
making windows vanish in my old-fashioned Unix X environment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the somewhat odd things about my old fashioned X Window System
environment is that when I ‘iconify’ or ‘minimize’ a window, it (mostly)
winds up as an actual icon on my root window (what in some environments
would be called the desktop), in contrast to the alternate approach
where the minimized window is represented in some sort of taskbar. I
have strong opinions about where some of these icons should go, and some
tools to automatically arrange this for various windows, including the
GNU Emacs windows I (now) use for reading email. ↫ Chris Siebenmann
Iconification should be possible in any modern desktop environment, and
it’s sad that this paradigm has pretty much entirely vanished. I would
love for iconified windows to be treated essentially the same way as
files, so you can move them around, drop them inside directories, and
even move them from one computer to another (assuming they have the
application in question installed). If I’m working on a project, and I
have a bunch of LibreOffice documents, spreadsheets, browser tabs, notes
in a text editor, some images open, and so on, I should be able to
iconify them all, keep them in the project’s directory, and de-iconify
them as if nothing had ever happened. Right now, you have to use files
and application states for that, which is cumbersome and annoying.
Sadly, advanced window management is dying. Shame.</p>

Overheard Vivian sniggering behind me; turned around and asked him what

positive political impact I’ve made on him, over all these years 😇

<p>
So, recently I’ve been rereading old journal entries, which is
<em>always</em> playing with fire a bit, but this time I decided to try
this new thing where I ONLY read the fuckin’ hilarious entries (and the
sexy ones, after a certain point) and none of the traumatic ones and oh
my god, this way is so much better. There’s so much shit I completely
forgot about. Why is it always the bad memories that stick in your mind,
and never the good ones! Feeling a bit of nostalgic sorrow now, but
still, this has been good fun.
