Here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we believe that it’s important that

research we are engaged in is broadening participation in computing
education by investigating how the subject can be made more culturally

<h2
id="fedora-change-proposal-suggests-switching-the-main-fedora-workstation-release-to-kde-plasma">Fedora
change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release
to KDE Plasma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Update: the proposal has now been formally announced on the devel
mailing list and Fedora Discussions. I have been assured by the main
author of the proposal itself that this is very much not an April Fools
joke, but of course, there’s still the very real possibility we’re being
led on here. Still, I’m taking the risk and treating this as a serious
change proposal for Fedora, even though it’s likely to cause some
controversy in the wider Fedora community. The proposal is written by
Joshua Strobl, the lead developer of Budgie. Yes, this is a change
proposal to make KDE the default desktop environment of Fedora
Workstation. The reasoning is that KDE is more approachable for new
users than GNOME, it supports standards better, the industry seems to be
making moves to KDE (see the Steam Deck), and so on. KDE also has more
advanced features people have come to expect from a desktop, like HDR,
VRR, and more, and it’s the more advanced Wayland desktop. The important
note here is that in the highly unlikely event this proposal would be
accepted, it’s not like current Fedora GNOME users will be ‘upgraded’ to
KDE when Fedora 42 gets released. The idea is to promote the current
Fedora Plasma spin to the main Fedora Workstation release, and demote
the Fedora GNOME release to a mere Fedora spin, like KDE is now. While I
would personally support this change, it’s pretty much 100% unlikely
this change proposal will make it through. Red Hat and Fedora are
entirely GNOME-first, and no matter how much I believe that’s misguided
when looking at the state of the two primary open source desktops today,
that’s not going to change. Still, it’s an interesting discussion point,
if only to highlight that the frustrations with GNOME run a lot deeper
than people seem to think.</p>

<p>
Back from the trip to Locarno and I’m feeling sick. The nose, the
frontal sinus cavity, ouch.
</p>
<p>
But strangely enough, the birch pollen season has also started. So what
is it?

<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-03-26-sick-1.jpg" alt="" />

(Zürich is super dark red.)

The report says:
</p>
<p>
“Eschen und Birken blühen frühzeitig in der gesamten Schweiz, und für
deren Pollen werden in den kommenden Tagen im Flachland und in mittleren
Lagen mässige bis starke Belastungswerte erwartet.”
</p>
<p>
Ash and birch are in bloom earlier than usual.
</p>
<p>
I’ll take one of these Cetirizine-based hayfever pills, drink another
cup of herbal infusion and go back to bed. Hopefully at least one of
these things will help.

tomorrow!

<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way back in the day, back when I wasn’t even working at OSNews yet, I
used to run QNX as my desktop operating system, together with a small
number of other enthusiasts. It was a struggle, for sure, but it was
fun, exciting, and nobody else was crazy enough to do so. Sadly, the
small QNX desktop community wasn’t even remotely interesting to QNX, and
later Blackberry when they acquired the company, and eventually the
stand-alone Neutrino-powered version of QNX disappeared behind confusing
signup screens and other dark patterns. It meant the end of our small
little community. Much to my utter surprise and delight, I saw a post by
js about how he ported GCC 10 to QNX – in this case, to QNX 6.5 SP1,
released in 2012 – and submitted it to pkgsrc. His ultimate goal is to
port one of his other projects, ObjFW, to QNX. He makes use of pkgsrc to
do this kind of work, which also means he had to make pkgsrc bootstrap
and a lot of other software work on QNX. We’re at QNX 8.0 by now, and as
much as I bang my head against QNX and BlackBerry’s wall of marketing
and corporate speak, I just can’t find out if it’s even still possible
to download QNX Neutrino and install it on real generic hardware
today.</p>

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Shufei">@Shufei</span></a> asks what we’ll
do with all the billionaires if we survive the next decade, the next
century. Like I said in that post about Israel and Palestine, it’s worth
imagining positive outcomes and then think about the intermediate steps.
So, assuming we make it, what happened?
</p>
<p>
I think the long term change we would need is extremely high taxes as a
an explicit redistribution mechanism. We’ll look back and say, “during
Late State Capitalism we nearly ended the planet but then we manage to
curb inequality and raised inheritance tax to 80%, the max income tax
bracket to 90% and the two-digit million wealth tax to 20%.”
</p>
<p>
The goal would be a society with salaries between 50k and 200k per year
and family, and wealth worth one year of salary. Health insurance paid
for by taxes. Retirement homes paid for by taxes. Pensions paid for by
immediate redistribution (i.e., taxes) instead of investments.

email deliverability in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>On October 3, 2023, Google and Yahoo announced upcoming email
security standards to prevent spam, phishing and malware attempts.
Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) is also enforcing these policies. With
the big 3 Email Service Providers (ESP) in agreement, expect widespread
adoption soon. Today’s threats are more complex than ever and more ESPs
will begin tightening the reigns. Failure to comply with these
guidelines will result in emails being blocked beginning April 2024. In
this article, we’re going to cover these guidelines and explain what
senders must do in order to achieve and maintain compliance. ↫ XOMedia
Some of these changes – most of them impact bulk senders and spammers –
should’ve been implemented ages ago, but seeing them being pushed by the
three major email providers, who all happened to be owned, of course, by
massive corporations, does raise quite a few red flags. Instinctively,
this makes me worried about ulterior motives, especially since running
your own email server is already fraught with issues due to the nebulous
ways Gmail treats emails coming from small servers. With the rising
interest in self-hosting and things like Mastodon, I hope we’re also
going to see a resurgence in hosting your own e-mail. I really don’t
like that all my email is going through Gmail – it’s what OSNews uses –
but I don’t feel like dealing with all the delivery issues people who
try self-hosting email lament about. With a possible renewed wave of
interest in it, we might be able to make the process easier and more
reliable.</p>

<p>After a couple of tests, the fix below is implemented here. For some
reason I wasn’t subscribed to my own feed, which accounted for the fact
that updates from this blog weren’t getting into the blogroll. That
troubles me, I have to try to piece together how that happened. In the
meantime it’s nice to have the instant updating working again. I didn’t
know that I had missed it, but I did.</p>

introduced a bug in the blogroll code where it was ignoring instant
updates. Probably the sexiest feature in the whole thing. The bug was
introduced on March 21, so it’s been there a while. You have to
hard-reload the page to get the new version. So, when I post this on
<a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>, it should move to
the top of the list immediately. So a good use-case is to leave
Scripting News open with the blogroll visible and every once in a while
you may find something interesting to read. I like having it there, but
of course, it’s my baby, so that’s understandable. :-)</p>

<p>I tried
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/kara-swishers-tech-love-story/">listening</a>
to one of Kara Swisher’s interviews for her new book. The interviewer
was someone I respect, Brian Lehrer at WNYC. But he has an old and imho
unfair view that CraigsList and Facebook are responsible for the demise
of local news. I was surprised when he said as much near the start of
the interview. Then Swisher went into an obviously very well rehearsed
schpiel that confirmed that he was absolutely right and the tech gods
weren’t fooling anyone. OK that was my limit, I switched to another
podcast. She’s got a great business model. Tell the press what they want
to hear and you will get good press, pretty much guaranteed.</p>

to separate Teams and Office globally amid antitrust scrutiny</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft will sell its chat and video app Teams separately from its
Office product globally, the U.S. tech giant said on Monday, six months
after it unbundled the two products in Europe in a bid to avert a
possible EU antitrust fine. The European Commission has been
investigating Microsoft’s tying of Office and Teams since a 2020
complaint by Salesforce-owned competing workspace messaging app Slack. ↫
Foo Yun Chee at Reuters I honestly misread this as Microsoft selling
Teams off, which would’ve been far bigger news. Unbundling Teams from
Office globally is just Microsoft applying its recent European Union
policy to the rest of the world. All we need now is Microsoft to stop
trying to make Teams for families and friends happen, because nobody
will ever want to use Teams for anything, let alone personal use.</p>

<p>Every computer has at least one heart which beats the cadence to all
the other chips. The CloCK output pin is connected to a copper line
which spreads to most components, into their CLK input pin. If you are
mostly a software person like me, you may have never noticed it but all
kinds of processors have a CLK input pin. From CPUs (Motorola 68000,
Intel Pentium, MOS 6502), to custom graphic chips (Midway’s DMA2, Capcom
CPS-A/CPS-B, Sega’s Genesis VDP) to audio chips (Yamaha 2151, OKI
msm6295), they all have one. ↫ Fabien Sanglard I’ve watched enough
Adrian Black that I already knew all of this, and I’m assuming so did
many of you. But hey, I’ll never pass up the opportunity to link to the

Pino now has all-new chainplates! We removed the original ones earlier
this month to inspect them and found some pit corrosion(as well as a
small crack), replacing them was necessary. With the chainplates gone,
we removed the entire starboard side cabinet to see what was behind
it—it’s always nice to see parts of our boat we’ve never seen. We also
replaced 3 old halyards on Pino. Devine earned themself a couple of

<h2 id="pay-per-scroll">Pay per scroll</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;7.40 am. I’m sitting on a rock. Birds are chirping. Annoying rain coming down the gray sky. The rock I’m sitting on is wet. That’s also annoying. I’m sitting here, watching my dog walking up and down, destroying all the sticks that are lying on the ground. It’s a chilled morning.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Anyway, I’m sitting here, typing this on my phone. I have my phone with
me. I shouldn’t. I should have a book with me. But it’s raining. And
books don’t go along well with rain.
</p>
<p>
Books are interesting objects. The entire consumption process of a book
is interesting, especially when compared to websites. There’s no
equivalent of the web for books. There’s no place where an infinite
supply of books is available to you at virtually no cost. Reading a book
involves some decision-making and, more often than not, some financial
investment.
</p>
<p>
Sure, some of you are probably saying that libraries are the equivalent
of the web for books but that’s not the same thing. And don’t get me
wrong, libraries are great!
</p>
<p>
Reflecting on books made me think about what the web would look like if
it was some sort of pay-per-scroll platform. Not a place where virtually
everything is free but a place where everything has to be purchased in
order to be consumed. Which sites would I be willing to pay for? I’m
going to ignore the obvious answers because I’m sure almost everyone
would have sites like Wikipedia or YouTube. Those are boring answers.
Aggregators such as Hacker News or Reddit would also not be something
I’d be interested in paying for because the actual content lives
somewhere else. So I’d be paying just for the commentary.
</p>
<p>
In my case, I’d probably pay for two types of websites: either personal
sites of people that do things I enjoy or that have interesting takes on
the world or sites that collect content coming from a diverse group of
people (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com">LessWrong</a> is a good
example).
</p>
<p>
Would I be happy if the web was some sort of à la carte menu rather than
a free buffet? I’d say no. Still, thinking about this made me
realize—once again—that my media diet is something that I have to always
keep in mind. It also reminded me that I’m not reading enough books!

<h2 id="ora2pg-24.3-have-been-released">Ora2Pg 24.3 have been
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Bangkok, Thailand - March 29th, 2024
</p>
<h2>
Ora2Pg
</h2>
<p>
Version 24.3 of Ora2Pg, a free and reliable tool used to migrate an
Oracle database to PostgreSQL, has been officially released and is
publicly available for download.
</p>
<p>
This release fixes several issues reported since last release and
especially a regression in GEOMETRY data export. As usual, it also adds
some new features and improvements.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Add new configuration directive <code>ORACLE_FDW_PREFETCH</code> to
control the “prefetch” used by oracle_fdw COPY/INSERT. Prior to this
change Ora2Pg uses the default “prefetch” of oracle_fdw, which at the
time of writing is 50. Allowing this to be controlled by an Ora2Pg
configuration/option gives the option of increased performance at the
cost of some additional memory on the PostgreSQL side.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add new configuration directive <code>PGTT_NOSUPERUSER</code>. By
default the pgtt extension is loaded using the superuser privilege when
<code>EXPORT_GTT</code> is activated. Enabled it if you run the SQL
scripts generated using a non superuser user. It will use: <code>LOAD
‘$libdir/plugins/pgtt’;</code> instead of <code>LOAD ‘pgtt’;</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Backward compatibility changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Modify the behavior of triggers export with <code>EXPORT_INVALID</code>.
It used to apply to <code>ENABLED</code> or <code>DISABLED</code>
triggers instead of real <code>VALID</code> or <code>INVALID</code>
triggers. Export of invalid triggers will be controlled by
<code>EXPORT_INVALID</code> like others objects like functions,
packages, etc. This mean that disabled triggers that are valid will be
exported by default now, this was not the case before.
</li>
</ul>

more than just code</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>As some of the dust around the xz backdoor is slowly starting to
settle, we’ve been getting a pretty clear picture of what, exactly,
happened, and it’s not pretty. This is a story of the sole maintainer of
a crucial building block of the open source stack having mental health
issues, which at least partly contributes to a lack of interest in
maintaining xz. It seems a coordinated campaign – consensus seems to
point to a state actor – is then started to infiltrate xz, with the goal
of inserting a backdoor into the project. Evan Boehs has done the
legwork of diving into the mailing lists and commit logs of various
projects and the people involved, and it almost reads like the nerd
version of a spy novel. It involves seemingly fake users and accounts
violently pressuring the original xz maintainer to add a second
maintainer; a second maintainer who mysteriously seems to appear at
around the same time, like a saviour. This second maintainer manages to
gain the original maintainer’s trust, and within months, this mysterious
newcomer more or less takes over as the new maintainer. As the new
maintainer, this person starts adding the malicious code in question.
Sockpuppet accounts show up to add code to oss-fuzz to try and make sure
the backdoor won’t be detected. Once all the code is in place for the
backdoor to function, more fake accounts show up to push for the
compromised versions of xz to be included in Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu,
and possibly others. Roughly at this point, the backdoor is discovered
entirely by chance because Andres Freund noticed his SSH logins felt a
fraction of a second slower, and he wanted to know why. What seems to
have happened here is a bad actor – again, most likely a state actor –
finding and targeting a vulnerable maintainer, who, through clever
social engineering on both a personal level as well as the project
level, gained control over a crucial but unexciting building block of
the open source stack. Once enough control and trust was gained, the bad
actor added a backdoor to do… Well, something. It seems nobody really
knows yet what the ultimate goal was, but we can all make some educated
guesses and none of them are any good. When we think of vulnerabilities
in computer software, we tend to focus on bugs and mistakes that
unintentionally create the conditions wherein someone with malicious
intent can do, well, malicious things. We don’t often consider the
possibility of maintainers being malicious, secretly adding backdoors
for all kinds of nefarious purposes. The problem the xz backdoor
highlights is that while we have quite a few ways to prevent, discover,
mitigate, and fix unintentional security holes, we seem to have pretty
much nothing in place to prevent intentional backdoors placed by trusted
maintainers. And this is a real problem. There are so many utterly
crucial but deeply boring building blocks all over the open source
stacks pretty much the entire computing world makes use of that it has
become a meme, spearheaded by xkcd’s classic comic. The weakness in many
of these types of projects is not the code, but the people maintaining
that code, most likely through no fault of their own. There are so many
things life can throw at you that would make you susceptible to social
engineering – money problems, health problems, mental health issues,
burnout, relationship problems, god knows what else – and the open
source community has nothing in place to help maintainers of obscure but
crucial pieces of infrastructure deal with problems like these. That’s
why I’m suggesting the idea of setting up a foundation – or whatever
legal entity makes sense – that is dedicated to helping maintainers who
face the kinds of problems like the maintainer of xz did. A place where
a maintainer who is dealing with problems outside of the code repository
can go to for help, advice, maybe even financial and health assistance
if needed. Even if all this foundation offers to someone is a person to
talk to in confidence, it might mean the difference between burning out
completely, or recovering at least enough to then possibly find other
ways to improve one’s situation. If someone is burnt-out or has a mental
health crisis, they could contact the foundation, tell their story, and
say, hey, I need a few months to recover and deal with my problems, can
we put out a call among already trusted members of the open source
community to step in for me for a while? Keep the ship steady as she
goes without rocking it until I get back or we find someone to take over
permanently? This way, the wider community will also know the regular,
trusted maintainer is stepping down for a while, and that any new
commits should be treated with extra care, solving the problem of some
unknown maintainer of an obscure but important package suffering in
obscurity, the only hints found in the low-volume mailing list well
after something goes wrong. The financial responsibility for such a
safety net should undoubtedly be borne by the long list of ultra-rich
megacorporations who profit off the backs of these people toiling away
in obscurity. The financial burden for something like this would be
pocket change to the likes of Google, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and so on,
but could make a contribution to open source far greater than any code
dump. Governments could probably be involved too, but that will most
likely open up a whole can of worms, so I’m not sure if that would be a
good idea. I’m not proposing this be some sort of glorified ATM where
people can go to get some free money whenever they feel like it. The
goal should be to help people who form crucial cogs in the delicate
machinery of computing to live healthy, sustainable lives so their code
and contributions to the community don’t get compromised. This</p>

significant performance and correctness improvements to the kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>This year, there have been numerous improvements both to the kernel’s
correctness, as well as raw performance. The signal and TLB shootdown
MRs have significantly improved kernel memory integrity and possibly
eliminated many hard-to-debug and nontrivial heisenbugs. Nevertheless,
there is still a lot of work to be done optimizing and fixing bugs in
relibc, in order to improve compatibility with ported applications, and
most importantly of all, getting closer to a self-hosted Redox. ↫ Jacob
Lorentzon (4lDO2) I love how much of the focus for Redox seems to be on
the lower levels of the operating system, because it’s something many
projects tend to kind of forget to highlight, to spend more time on new
icons or whatever. These in-depth Redox articles are always informative,
and have me very excited about Redox’ future. Obviously, Redox is on the
list of operating systems I need to write a proper article about. I’m
not sure if there’s enough for a full review or if it’ll be more of a
short look – we’ll see when we get there.</p>

11 may get a highly requested Start menu redesign, here is how to try
it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>In October 2023, we published a recap of the top 10 features Windows
11 users want for the redesigned Start menu. Number 6 was the ability to
switch from list view to grid view in the “All Apps” list, which
received over 1,500 upvotes in the Feedback Hub. Six months later,
Microsoft finally appears to be ready to give users what they want.
PhantomOfEarth, the ever-giving source of hidden stuff in Windows 11
preview builds, discovered that Windows 11 build 22635.3420 lets you
change from list to grid view in the “All Apps” section. Like other
unannounced features, this one requires a bit of tinkering using the
ViVeTool app until Microsoft makes it official. ↫ Taras Buria I’m still
baffled Microsoft consistently manages to mess up something as
once-iconic and impactful like the Start menu. It seems like Microsoft
just can’t leave it well enough alone, even though it kind of already
nailed it in Windows 95 – just give us that, but with a modern search
function, and we’re all going to be happy. That’s it. We don’t want or
need more.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-write">Why I write</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The other day I was asked why I have a blog, why I write. Hard questions to answer. I don’t really know why I’m doing all this. I know why I started back in 2017. But the reason why I started is long gone at this point. I started the blog as some sort of public accountability tool and it’s now everything but that. I don’t write to be accountable. I probably should.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
The more I write on this site, the more I realize that what I’m trying
to do is to connect. I’m trying to connect with others—with you—but I’m
also trying to help others connect with each other. And, in a weird way,
I’m also trying to connect with myself.
</p>
<p>
It’s why I find it so enjoyable to share other people’s projects on this
site. It’s why I’m happy to remind you that March is almost over and if
you haven’t already you should write something for this month’s
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">IndieWeb
Carnival</a>. It’s also why I’m finding most of the current web so
annoying and distasteful. The endless self-promotion, the attempt to
grow a persona, the lack of authenticity. Everything becomes
transactional and something is lost in the process.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I’m a nobody. I’m just a random person with a website like countless
others out there. There’s nothing special about what I’m doing here and
that’s how it should be. Sharing what we find interesting shouldn’t be
some special activity. Being kind to one another should be the norm.
We’re social creatures. Connecting with others is a great way to grow
and improve as human beings. This is probably why I’m writing. To become
a better me.

PDF</h2>

2024-03-27 Convert text file to PDF
</h1>
<p>
I just couldn’t find a good way to turn a text file into a PDF. Within
Emacs, <code>ps-print-buffer</code> is hard to configure and my two
specific problems were the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
everything is turned into Latin-1 so I cannot use the EN dash;
</li>
<li>
the line length was set too short so that I couldn’t print lines longer
than 80 characters even though there was plenty of space left.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wasted some time trying to write something in Bash, turned to Perl and
wasted some more time trying to figure out why the encodings were all
wrong except when the encodings were OK but Perl gave me a warning for
every multi-byte character. So frustrating.
</p>
<p>
The solution ended up not being decoding and encoding the bytes in the
Perl script but to use the <code>–encoding</code> option for
<code>weasyprint</code>. In this case, it wasn’t Perl’s fault, it was my
fear of Perl’s encoding issues that led my down endless variations of
<code>binmode</code>, <code>:utf8</code>, <code>decode_utf8</code> and
<code>encode_utf8</code>. But I think I have it, now.
</p>
<p>
This is what I ended up with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
use <code>weasyprint</code>;
</li>
<li>
wrap it all in a <code>pre</code> tag.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I created a script called <code>to-pdf</code> with the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Modern::Perl;
use File::Basename;

if (@ARGV == 0) {
  die &quot;Usage: to-pdf file.txt ...\n&quot;;
}

for (@ARGV) {
  open(my $text, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $_) or die &quot;Cannot read $_\n&quot;;
  my ($name, $path, $suffix) = fileparse($_, &quot;.txt&quot;);
  open(my $html, &quot;|-&quot;) || exec &quot;weasyprint&quot;, &quot;--encoding&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;$path$name.pdf&quot;;

  print $html &lt;&lt;'BEG';
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family: Iosevka; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;
BEG

  for (&lt;$text&gt;) { print $html $_ }; # copy text

  print $html &lt;&lt;'END';
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
END
}

<h2 id="maptwin-an-80s-era-automotive-navigation-computer">Maptwin: an
80s-era automotive navigation computer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I imported a Japanese-market 4×4 van into the
US; a 1996 Mitsubishi Delica. Based on the maps I found in the seat
pocket and other clues, it seems to have spent its life at some city
dweller’s cabin in the mountains around Fukushima, and only driven
occasionally. Despite being over 25 years old, it only had 77,000 km on
the odometer. The van had some interesting old tech installed in it:
what appears to be a radar detector labeled “Super Eagle ✔️30” and a
Panasonic-brand electronic toll collection device that you can insert a
smart card into. One particularly noteworthy accessory that was
available in mid-90s Delicas was a built-in karaoke machine for the rear
passengers. Sadly, mine didn’t have that feature. But the most
interesting accessory installed in the van was the Avco Maptwin Inter,
which I immediately identified as some kind of electronic navigation
aid, about which there is very little information available on the
English-language internet. When I first saw the Maptwin, I had thought
it might be some kind of proto-GPS that displayed latitude/longitude
coordinates that you could look up on a paper map. Alas, it’s not that
cool. It was not connected to any kind of antenna, and the electronics
inside seem inadequate for the reception of a GPS signal. The Maptwin
was, however, wired into an RPM counter that was attached between the
transmission and the speedometer cable, presumably to delivery extremely
accurate and convenient display of how many kilometers have been
traveled since the display was last reset. What I’ve been able to learn
is that the Maptwin is computer that was mostly used for rally race
navigation, precursor to devices still available from manufacturers like
Terra Trip. Now, the Mitsubishi Delica is about the best 4×4 minivan you
can get, but it’s extremely slow and unwieldy at speed, so it would be
pretty terrible for rally racing. My best guess is that the owner used
this device as a navigation aid for overland exploration, as the name
“Maptwin” implies, to augment the utility of a paper map. On the other
hand, I found an article that indicates that some kinds of rallies were
not high speed affairs, but rather accuracy-based navigation puzzles of
sorts, so who knows? The Maptwin wasn’t working when I got the van, and
I don’t know if it’s actually broken or just needs to be wired up
correctly. If any OSNews readers have any additional information about
any of the devices I’ve mentioned, please enlighten us in the comments.
If anyone would like to try to get the Maptwin working and report back,
please let me know.</p>
