<h2 id="understanding-ap-and-rss">Understanding AP and RSS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
What does ActivityPub does that RSS doesn’t?
</p>
<p>
Off the top of my head, it’s not the ability to syndicate, RSS already
does that. I can follow anyone on any server.
</p>
<p>
I think it’s the timeline? And the ability to delete posts. Keeping all
that in sync is a lot of work, and presumably a lot of traffic?
</p>
<p>
Also replies. If I reply to a post when viewing it on another server,
the reply should show up under any other view of that post.
</p>
<p>
What else??
</p>
<p>
PS: Only thinking about features that are used by Mastodon to federate,
not potential future features. If that were the rule, then RSS could do
anything AP could do, right – because you can always add the feature.
So, just the features that are in use.

2024-04-04 An eye for an eye
</h1>
<p>
I often think about the number of dead killed in an incident and the
number of dead killed in the reaction. It’s not really revenge but a
sort of “we can strike back so we should” and then people don’t know
when to stop.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I find that “an eye for an eye” is terrible advice.
</p>
<p>
I have no words for “a hundred eyes for an eye.”
</p>
<p>
Think about Gaza in 2024: over 30,000 dead in half a year.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As of 5 March 2024, over 31,000 people (30,228 Palestinian and 1,410
Israeli) have been reported as killed in the Israel–Hamas war, including
94 journalists (89 Palestinian, 2 Israeli and 3 Lebanese) and over 136
UNRWA aid workers.
</p>
<p>
On 7 October 2023, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 764
civilians, were killed, and 248 persons taken hostage during the initial
attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip. –
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Israel–Hamas_war">Casualties
of the Israel Hamas war</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
30228 Palestinians dead after the original incident killed 1139 is more
than 25:1.
</p>
<p>
I wonder about Iraq, too: 300,000 dead in over 20 years.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Documented civilian deaths from violence: 187,116 – 210,566
</p>
<p>
Total violent deaths including combatants: 300,000 –
<a href="https://www.iraqbodycount.org/">Iraq Body Count</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And why?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Another justification included the alleged connection between the regime
of Saddam Hussein and that of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda
that had attacked the United States during the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks. –
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq">2003
invasion of Iraq</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The original incident:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Excluding the hijackers, the attacks killed 2,977 people, injured
thousands more … –
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">September
11 attacks</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
300,000 dead after the original incident killed 2,977 is more than
100:1.
</p>
<p>
The two seem somehow related, I just can’t put it into words. High tech
weapons against civilians, drones, city warfare, a population that hates
the invader, news so terrible I can’t even finish reading the Wikipedia
articles.

Ukrainian forces: ~70,000 killed, 100,000–120,000 wounded (US estimates)
… Russian forces: ~120,000 killed, 170,000–180,000 wounded (US
estimates) … the United Nations confirmed that by 31 January 2024,
10,378 civilians had been killed and 19,632 had been injured, but said
they believe the real number is higher. –

<h2 id="tribblix-image-structural-changes">Tribblix image structural
changes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve talked about Tribblix before on OSNews – it’s a distribution of
illumos, built by Peter Tribble. In his latest blog post, Tribble
details some of the changes he’s made to the live ISO and other images
for the most recent release. All along, there’s been an overlay (think a
group package) called base-iso that lists the packages that are present
in the live image. On installation, this is augmented with a few extra
packages that you would expect to be present in a running system but
which don’t make much sense in a live image, to construct the base
system. You can add additional software, but the base is assumed to be
present. The snag with this is that base-iso is very much a
single-purpose generic concept. By its very nature it has to be minimal
enough to not be overly bloated, yet contain as many drivers as
necessary to handle the majority of systems. As such, the regular ISO
image has fallen between 2 stools – it doesn’t have every single driver,
so some systems won’t work, while it has a lot of unnecessary drivers
for a lot of common use cases. ↫ Peter Tribble Tribble then details how
he addressed this issue, which is, unsurprisingly, rather clever. I’m
not going to spoil it here, so go on over and read the details.</p>

<p>I work at Red Hat on GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection. For the last
five releases of GCC, I’ve been working on -fanalyzer, a static analysis
pass that tries to identify various problems at compile-time, rather
than at runtime. It performs “symbolic execution” of C source
code—effectively simulating the behavior of the code along the various
possible paths of execution through it. This article summarizes what’s
new with -fanalyzer in GCC 14, which I hope will be officially released
sometime in April 2024. ↫ David Malcolm No matter how many more of you

<p>date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>The SUSE security team restricts the installation of system wide
D-Bus services and Polkit policies in openSUSE distributions and derived
SUSE products. Any package that ships these features needs to be
reviewed by us first, before it can be added to production repositories.
In November, openSUSE KDE packagers approached us with a long list of
KDE components for an upcoming KDE6 major release. The packages needed
adjusted D-Bus and Polkit whitelistings due to renamed interfaces or
other breaking changes. Looking into this many components at once was a
unique experience that also led to new insights, which will be discussed
in this article. For readers that are new to D-Bus and/or Polkit, the
following sections offer a summary to get a better idea about these
systems. ↫ Matthias Gerstner You don’t get these kinds of in-depth looks
at how a major new release like KDE 6 gets implemented in a popular
distribution like openSUSE. What’s especially crazy is that this only
really covers D-Bus and Polkit, and those are just two of the countless
aspects of openSUSE affected by KDE 6.</p>

want all the information about the products I make to be instantly
available to anyone who wants to know, in exactly the form they want it.
Until ChatGPT, that was a totally unattainable dream. But now, for many
topics, it’s reality. For example, if I have a question about CSS, and
believe me, I do – if I can ask the question clearly enough, I can get a
clear and complete explanation of why the browser did the crazy thing
with layout that it did. It means I could do something beautiful and
refined like the blogroll I worked on in February and March, and the UI
stuff I’m working on in March and April.
</p>
<p>
I can’t wait until ChatGPT can answer all those questions about my
stuff. But then people who make music don’t want their songs to be
available the same way. As someone who wants to know as much as possible
about songs I have always loved but had no idea how they were made, or
what they meant to the writer, knowledge about the work is equally
valuable as understanding technical topics. I think the big difference
is knowing that life is short, and if we want to leave something behind
of ourselves, having the information be available is a blessing, not
something to fight against. I don’t see why software designers in the
future should have to reinvent what my generation has already figured
out. I don’t want them to have to. It keeps coming back to this one idea
– to solve the problems we have as a species we’re going to have to
<i>work together, </i>and part of that means not being so guarded and
selfish about sharing what we’ve learned.
</p>
<p>
We had this problem with music before, with Napster. The users of music,
such as myself, found that the ability to program our own music was so
liberating. To listen to a song a few times before moving on made a huge
difference, or to choose a song to hear because we just thought of it
for the first time in 30 years. But we were literally mocked by music
promoters and artists. But ultimately, like it or not, the users got the
power they wanted. It’s got to happen that way too for ChatGPT et al. I
guess some people must’ve felt that search engines were going to rob
creative people of control of their creations. I guess this is something
we always have to go through.

substructure. A team of astronomers has used NASA’s James Webb Space

relatively compact in size but hosts a frenzy of star […]</p>

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@rdonoghue" title="@rdonoghue@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="rdonoghue">@rdonoghue</span></a> wondered
(mostly ironically, I suspect) about a correlation between the length of
the commute and a propensity to favour Return To the Office (RTO)
policies.
</p>
<p>
I used to walk 35min to the office and I still prefer the home office.
</p>
<p>
Based on what I saw during lockdown and based on what my wife tells me,
I think more interesting options are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do you have kids at home and prefer Return To the Office? (if older)
</li>
<li>
Do you have parents at home and prefer Return To the Office? (if
younger)
</li>
<li>
Do you manage a team but don’t talk to team members individually and
prefer Return To the Office because you can overhear them talk? (if
project manager)
</li>
<li>
Do you have a need for sycophants surrounding you and prefer Return To
the Office so you keep an eye on them? (ugh)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m sure there are more options but those seemed to be the obvious ones.
</p>
<p>
In all fairness:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do you have a hard time with focus and prefer the Home Office so that
you’re not exposed to noise, cross-talk and other distractions by
coworkers? (me)
</li>
</ul>

Stability AI’s founder tanked his billion-dollar startup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>It was Stability’s armada of GPUs, the wildly powerful and equally
expensive chips undergirding AI, that were so taxing the company’s
finances. Hosted by AWS, they had long been one of Mostaque’s bragging
points; he often touted them as one of the world’s 10 largest
supercomputers. They were responsible for helping Stability’s
researchers build and maintain one of the top AI image generators, as
well as break important new ground on generative audio, video and 3D
models. “Undeniably, Stability has continued to ship a lot of models,”
said one former employee. “They may not have profited off of it, but the
broader ecosystem benefitted in a huge, huge way.” But the costs
associated with so much compute were now threatening to sink the
company. According to an internal October financial forecast seen by
Forbes, Stability was on track to spend $99 million on compute in 2023.
It noted as well that Stability was “underpaying AWS bills for July (by
$1M)” and “not planning to pay AWS at the end of October for August
usage ($7M).” Then there were the September and October bills, plus $1
million owed to Google Cloud and $600,000 to GPU cloud data center
CoreWeave. (Amazon, Google and CoreWeave declined to comment.) ↫ Kenrick
Cai and Iain Martin As a Dutch person, I can smell a popping bubble from
a mile away, even if tulipmania is most likely anti-Dutch British
propaganda. In all seriousness, there’s definitely signs that the insane
energy and compute costs of artificial image and video generation in
particular are rising at such an insane pace it’s simply unsustainable
for the popularity of these tools to just keep rising. Eventually
someone’s going to have to pay, and I wonder just how much regular
people are willing to pay for this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>Amazon is phasing out its checkout-less grocery stores with “Just

company’s senior vice president of grocery stores says they’re moving
away from Just Walk Out, which relied on cameras and sensors to track
what people were leaving the store with. Just over half of Amazon Fresh
stores are equipped with Just Walk Out. The technology allows customers
to skip checkout altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter the
store. Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied on
more than 1,000 people in India watching and labeling videos to ensure
accurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and they
watched you as you shopped. ↫ Maxwell Zeff Behind every Silicon Valley

<h1 id="2024-04-01-what-s-the-plan">
2024-04-01 What’s the plan?
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Shufei">@Shufei</span></a> asks what we’ll
do with all the billionaires if we survive the next decade, the next
century. Like I said in that post about Israel and Palestine, it’s worth
imagining positive outcomes and then think about the intermediate steps.
So, assuming we make it, what happened?
</p>
<p>
I think the long term change we would need is
<a href="2024-04-03-tax">extremely high taxes</a> as a an explicit
redistribution mechanism. We’ll look back and say, “during Late State
Capitalism we nearly ended the planet but then we manage to curb
inequality and raised inheritance tax to 80%, the max income tax bracket
to 90% and the two-digit million wealth tax to 20%.”
</p>
<p>
The goal would be a society with salaries between 50k and 200k per year
and family, and wealth worth one year of salary. Health insurance paid
for by taxes. Retirement homes paid for by taxes. Pensions paid for by
immediate redistribution (i.e., taxes) instead of investments.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Shufei">@Shufei</span></a> commented on
this and mentioned land reform:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Rentierism in all facets has virtually no restraints in most of the
world. That is sometimes <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> of capital which a
family could have put to family resiliency, instead going to landlords
and investment epiphenomina like gentrification. I’m not sure oldschool
petite bourgeois distributionism (landed yeomanry) is the big answer
there, but under a “permanent jubilee” it might be workable enough to
eliminate the scourge of landlordism.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m not quite sure what the plan is, though.
</p>
<p>
For urban planning it seems to be state-sponsored coop housing. As soon
as the percentage of sponsored housing goes up, the other rents go down,
while still leaving the option of more generous housing being built.
This is a lesson that was somewhat forgotten in Zürich for a few decades
and that seems to explain a lot about the high rents, here.
</p>
<p>
For agriculture, what seems to have worked in Switzerland (still not
enough but a lot better than in the European Union) is protectionism,
direct payment, zoning laws, government fixed pricing on agricultural
land, etc. not a single thing but a whole set of interlocking
mechanisms. And there is still room for improvement. But I’d defer to
groups active in food sovereignty to better answer that question, I
guess. Maybe <a href="https://viacampesina.org/">Via Campesina</a> has a
plan, for example.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> just posted two
links, one discussing alternatives and one where she looks for the
elements of the solution. Let’s talk about them.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/alternatives">Alternatives</a>
argues for market socialism, as I read it. In a subsequent comment on
fedi she disagreed with this take and said that it was by far the
weakest alternative. But I’m not so sure. Planned economy doesn’t work;
small nudges is what we have and it doesn’t seem to be working either;
and the last option seems to be “utopias and sundry”. That doesn’t sound
promising, either. I still think that in the given list, market
socialism doesn’t sound bad at all.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Worker-owned cooperatives that trade with each other on a market. That’s
it. That’s the whole plan.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then again, none of the alternatives seem pretty strong.
</p>
<p>
I’m also not sure how market socialism would work in a global
environment. How would we deal with local bad harvests and war? It’s
biggest benefit seems to be that it promises incremental improvements.
No bloody revolution necessary. And that’s already a plus.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A big upside of this track is that it’s somewhat compatible with the
other systems and with present-day market capitalism. This means that it
can be implemented piecemeal wherever it make sense and I think that’s
awesome.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/solution">My best guess at a climate
solution</a> is where Sandra ends with a call to regain influence in the
media.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Making changes in our own lives is great (eat plants) but ideally we’d
want politicians (and their overlords: mass media) to sober up and
implement policies to steer industry and the rich.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here in Switzerland (and elsewhere), the fascists like to complain about
left-wing media and fight them and defund them until they have them
under their thumb (remember Berlusconi’s media take-over in Italy). So
we need to fight them all the way: Decry their meddling and scheming and
increase the funding. Demand that they drop the airhead programming and
bring back material that helps lift people up, not drag them down.
Education and information is key.
</p>
<p>
I’m not a media person, so I don’t know how to do it. All I can say is
that music programs that have interesting discussions surrounding the
music work well for me. Podcasts work for me. Series seem to work for
some. Just drop the quiz shows and reality-TV and all that order
material that only serves to distract.
</p>
<p>
I guess that in my heart of hearts I feel that humanity’s main problem
is sociopaths. These people are always there and they love their person
gain and don’t feel other people’s pain. Therefore, the struggle is
eternal. There is no solidification, no solution that will hold for
generations. Every generation will have to fight this fight. All I can
say is that it’s a mistake to let a generation grow up in the belief
that politics is not important, that struggle isn’t necessary, or that
the end of history has come.
</p>
<p>
That is never going to be true.

<h1 id="2024-04-03-we-need-more-taxes">
2024-04-03 We need more taxes
</h1>
<p>
I recently wondered about <a href="2024-04-01-the-plan">our plan</a> for
dealing with the rich. A key part is increased taxation.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I hear talk about the state crumbling (and since my wife works
for the federal government in Switzerland I hear plenty of that), the
first thing many people think is that the fault lies with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget_amendment">balanced
budget amendment</a> (“Schuldenbremse”). And indeed, that is the obvious
cause for many of the problems.
</p>
<p>
Arguing about the balanced budget amendment is doomed, however. Most
people don’t understand the difference between household economics and
state economics. A much simpler solution exists, one that everybody
understands: <strong>INCREASE TAXES FFS!</strong>
</p>
<p>
Now I know why countries like Switzerland don’t like to increase taxes:
Where would all the oligarchs go? Where would all the great holdings go?
And within Switzerland, same thing: as soon as one canton dropped
inheritance tax they all feared that the rich would move elsewhere and
started dropping their inheritance taxes. And now
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbschaftssteuer_in_der_Schweiz">there
is practically none</a>, for descendants. Wealth can stay in the family,
like in the good old days of feudalism.
</p>
<p>
Next up: Fighting tax evasion, fighting the free movement of capital,
fighting for a global tax (do not follow the Swiss model of malevolent
compliance!), and more. The fighting just never stops, I know. 😩
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax">Progressive
taxation</a> is great. The more you own and make, the more you can
afford to support the public good. Pay proportionally more!
</p>
<p>
Taxes are great for redistribution of wealth. We don’t need to argue
about Universal Basic Income (I support it!) or new subsidies or
anything else like that: We can simply use existing mechanisms to
redistribute wealth, reducing that Gini coefficient, increasing
happiness, increasing the feeling of living in a fair and just society,
increasing the feeling that work can get you to the top.
</p>
<p>
Taxes are great to fight inflation, too! If the state hands out more
money in a time of crisis, that excess money has to be taken back via
taxes. This keeps the money flowing (and only money flowing is what
counts). Of course you don’t want to bring it back via asocial taxation
schemes like a fixed per-head tax, or a VAT, but something like
progressive income tax or progressive wealth tax.
</p>
<p>
This makes sense, even in broken system like ours: COVID money for
everybody, everybody is squeezed by landlords and industry, then tax the
rich to get the money back. Virtuous cycle!

everyone does, and it changes the global values of things. So when you
install it on a page that has its own ideas how things should work, you
can get an unpleasant effect (to put it mildly). So I created a
localized

announces prices for the Windows 10 Extended Security Update
program</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows 10 is reaching end of support on October 14, 2025, so if
you’re still using Windows 10 – and let’s face it, if you’re somehow
forced to still use Windows, better 10 than 11 – your time is running
out. Luckily, end of support is a bit of a nebulous term when it comes
to Microsoft products, and many among you, especially those managing
larger fleets of systems, will know Microsoft offers something called
the Extended Security Update (ESU) program, wherein you get additional
security updates even after end of support. Microsoft just unveiled the
prices for this program for Windows 10. While there’s several schemes,
the one most of you will be interested in is this one: With the 5-by-5
activation method, you’ll download an activation key and apply it to
individual Windows 10 devices that you’ve selected for your ESU program.
Manage it via scripting or the Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT),
among other methods. You can use on-premises management tools such as
Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) with Configuration Manager to
download and apply the updates to your Windows 10 devices. The 5-by-5
activation subscription will establish the Year One list price of ESU
for Windows 10. This is the base license and will cost $61 USD per
device for Year 1, similar to the Windows 7 ESU Year 1 price. ↫ Jason
Leznek Honestly, that’s not an egregious price, but do note that this
price doubles every year for three years total, and note that if you
want to start using ESU in year two, you’ll have to pay for year one as
well. In other words, pricing ramps up fast. Furthermore, this program
only includes security updates – no new features or anything like that,
and it doesn’t include support either. So, if you’re still using Windows
10 after October 14, 2025, you’ll either have to pay up, have an
insecure system, downgrade to Windows 11, or move to a better
alternative. Choice’s yours.</p>

NASA Selects America’s First Astronauts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>On Nov. 5, 1958, NASA, newly established to lead America’s civilian
space program, formally established the Space Task Group (STG) at NASA’s
Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, to implement one of the
nation’s top priorities – to develop a spacecraft capable of sending
humans into space and returning them safely to Earth. In January […]</p>

<h2 id="discord-turns-to-ads">Discord turns to ads</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Quests are a way for players to discover games and earn rewards for
playing them on Discord. We started experimenting with them over the
last year, and millions of you opted in and completed them. We’ve heard
great feedback from developers who partnered with us to create them and
from many of you who completed one. If you didn’t see firsthand, the
“May the 4th” Fortnite Quest is a great example. Now, we’re opening up
sponsored Quests to more game developers. ↫ Peter Sellis That’s a lot of
fancy, hip words to say Discord is going to show you ads. I have an odd
relationship with Discord – it holds a special place in my heart because
through Discord is how I met my now-wife and mother of our children, so
understandably, the chat platform has a special meaning for us. At the
same time, though, Discord has been getting steadily worse and less
usable over the years, and while my wife isn’t too bothered by that, I
certainly am – and so we moved our instant messaging over to Signal
instead. My wife still uses Discord with her friends. Seeing a platform
that used to be quite usable, and easily the best way to manage a group
of geographically spread-out friends, fall prey to the same kind of
bullshit so many other platforms have succumbed to. Discord today is
almost unrecognisable to what it was like 6-7 years ago, and now there’s
even going to be ads – the final nail in the coffin for the possibility
of me ever going back to using it.</p>

id="redis-license-change-and-forking-are-a-mess-that-everybody-can-feel-bad-about">Redis’
license change and forking are a mess that everybody can feel bad
about</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Redis, a tremendously popular tool for storing data in-memory rather
than in a database, recently switched its licensing from an open source
BSD license to both a Source Available License and a Server Side Public
License (SSPL). The software project and company supporting it were
fairly clear in why they did this. Redis CEO Rowan Trollope wrote on
March 20 that while Redis and volunteers sponsored the bulk of the
project’s code development, “the majority of Redis’ commercial sales are
channeled through the largest cloud service providers, who commoditize
Redis’ investments and its open source community.” Clarifying a bit,
“cloud service providers hosting Redis offerings will no longer be
permitted to use the source code of Redis free of charge.” This
generated a lot of discussion, blowback, and action. The biggest thing
was a fork of the Redis project, Valkey, that is backed by The Linux
Foundation and, critically, also Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud,
Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap Inc. Valkey is “fully open source,” Linux
Foundation execs note, with the kind of BSD-3-Clause license Redis
sported until recently. You might note the exception of Microsoft from
that list of fork fans. ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica Moves like this
never go down well.</p>

id="indieweb-carnival-good-enough-and-the-search-for-perfection">IndieWeb
Carnival: Good enough and the search for perfection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There’s a specific type of beauty that can only be found in the most perfect of creations. Pure shapes, smooth surfaces. Some objects can only be the result of someone not settling for “good enough”.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
There’s also another type of beauty, the one Japanese call
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">wabi-sabi</a>, the
appreciation of things that are imperfect.
</p>
<p>
I don’t see these two things as being opposite to each other, but rather
complementary. Like everything in life, the creation process is an act
of balance.
</p>
<p>
At times I feel trapped between the two. Every day, whether I’m writing,
coding or designing, a part of me strives for perfection while another
is painfully aware that perfection is a mirage. What looks perfect now
won’t look perfect tomorrow. I grow, I evolve, I change and my
definition of perfection evolves with me.
</p>
<p>
This post won’t be perfect but it’s going to be “good enough”. All my
posts are. They have to be. Because a perfect post would never get
posted. Perfection and the real world are like parallel lines in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_geometry">descriptive
geometry </a> whose crossing point can only be found at infinity.
</p>
<p>
It’s why deadlines are important. It’s why constraints are important.
Learning to embrace “good enough” is not easy but it’s a necessary step
if you want to achieve anything.

id="fedora-change-proposal-suggests-switching-the-main-fedora-workstation-release-to-kde-plasma">Fedora
change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release
to KDE Plasma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Update: the proposal has now been formally announced on the devel
mailing list and Fedora Discussions. I have been assured by the main
author of the proposal itself that this is very much not an April Fools
joke, but of course, there’s still the very real possibility we’re being
led on here. Still, I’m taking the risk and treating this as a serious
change proposal for Fedora, even though it’s likely to cause some
controversy in the wider Fedora community. The proposal is written by
Joshua Strobl, the lead developer of Budgie. Yes, this is a change
proposal to make KDE the default desktop environment of Fedora
Workstation. The reasoning is that KDE is more approachable for new
users than GNOME, it supports standards better, the industry seems to be
making moves to KDE (see the Steam Deck), and so on. KDE also has more
advanced features people have come to expect from a desktop, like HDR,
VRR, and more, and it’s the more advanced Wayland desktop. The important
note here is that in the highly unlikely event this proposal would be
accepted, it’s not like current Fedora GNOME users will be ‘upgraded’ to
KDE when Fedora 42 gets released. The idea is to promote the current
Fedora Plasma spin to the main Fedora Workstation release, and demote
the Fedora GNOME release to a mere Fedora spin, like KDE is now. While I
would personally support this change, it’s pretty much 100% unlikely
this change proposal will make it through. Red Hat and Fedora are
entirely GNOME-first, and no matter how much I believe that’s misguided
when looking at the state of the two primary open source desktops today,
that’s not going to change. Still, it’s an interesting discussion point,
if only to highlight that the frustrations with GNOME run a lot deeper
than people seem to think.</p>

2024-03-27 Sick? Or Hayfever?
</h1>
<p>
Back from the trip to Locarno and I’m feeling sick. The nose, the
frontal sinus cavity, ouch.
</p>
<p>
But strangely enough, the birch pollen season has also started. So what
is it?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-03-26-sick-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
(Zürich is super dark red.)

<p>
The report says:
</p>
<p>
“Eschen und Birken blühen frühzeitig in der gesamten Schweiz, und für
deren Pollen werden in den kommenden Tagen im Flachland und in mittleren
Lagen mässige bis starke Belastungswerte erwartet.”
</p>
<p>
Ash and birch are in bloom earlier than usual.
</p>
<p>
I’ll take one of these Cetirizine-based hayfever pills, drink another
cup of herbal infusion and go back to bed. Hopefully at least one of
these things will help.

<strong>2024-03-30</strong>. Still sick, but the fever is gone. Perhaps
now it’s just the hayfever?

<p>
<strong>2024-04-02</strong>. Recovery is on track. Falling asleep was
hard. Some nose blowing still. Not sure about focus. It’s good enough
for an hour or so? Back to bed now. I hope to be back on my feet
tomorrow!

<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way back in the day, back when I wasn’t even working at OSNews yet, I
used to run QNX as my desktop operating system, together with a small
number of other enthusiasts. It was a struggle, for sure, but it was
fun, exciting, and nobody else was crazy enough to do so. Sadly, the
small QNX desktop community wasn’t even remotely interesting to QNX, and
later Blackberry when they acquired the company, and eventually the
stand-alone Neutrino-powered version of QNX disappeared behind confusing
signup screens and other dark patterns. It meant the end of our small
little community. Much to my utter surprise and delight, I saw a post by
js about how he ported GCC 10 to QNX – in this case, to QNX 6.5 SP1,
released in 2012 – and submitted it to pkgsrc. His ultimate goal is to
port one of his other projects, ObjFW, to QNX. He makes use of pkgsrc to
do this kind of work, which also means he had to make pkgsrc bootstrap
and a lot of other software work on QNX. We’re at QNX 8.0 by now, and as
much as I bang my head against QNX and BlackBerry’s wall of marketing
and corporate speak, I just can’t find out if it’s even still possible
to download QNX Neutrino and install it on real generic hardware
today.</p>

<h2 id="a-deep-dive-into-email-deliverability-in-2024">A deep dive into
email deliverability in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>On October 3, 2023, Google and Yahoo announced upcoming email
security standards to prevent spam, phishing and malware attempts.
Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) is also enforcing these policies. With
the big 3 Email Service Providers (ESP) in agreement, expect widespread
adoption soon. Today’s threats are more complex than ever and more ESPs
will begin tightening the reigns. Failure to comply with these
guidelines will result in emails being blocked beginning April 2024. In
this article, we’re going to cover these guidelines and explain what
senders must do in order to achieve and maintain compliance. ↫ XOMedia
Some of these changes – most of them impact bulk senders and spammers –
should’ve been implemented ages ago, but seeing them being pushed by the
three major email providers, who all happened to be owned, of course, by
massive corporations, does raise quite a few red flags. Instinctively,
this makes me worried about ulterior motives, especially since running
your own email server is already fraught with issues due to the nebulous
ways Gmail treats emails coming from small servers. With the rising
interest in self-hosting and things like Mastodon, I hope we’re also
going to see a resurgence in hosting your own e-mail. I really don’t
like that all my email is going through Gmail – it’s what OSNews uses –
but I don’t feel like dealing with all the delivery issues people who
try self-hosting email lament about. With a possible renewed wave of
interest in it, we might be able to make the process easier and more
reliable.</p>

<p>I tried
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/kara-swishers-tech-love-story/">listening</a>
to one of Kara Swisher’s interviews for her new book. The interviewer
was someone I respect, Brian Lehrer at WNYC. But he has an old and imho
unfair view that CraigsList and Facebook are responsible for the demise
of local news. I was surprised when he said as much near the start of
the interview. Then Swisher went into an obviously very well rehearsed
schpiel that confirmed that he was absolutely right and the tech gods
weren’t fooling anyone. OK that was my limit, I switched to another
podcast. She’s got a great business model. Tell the press what they want
to hear and you will get good press, pretty much guaranteed.</p>

to separate Teams and Office globally amid antitrust scrutiny</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft will sell its chat and video app Teams separately from its
Office product globally, the U.S. tech giant said on Monday, six months
after it unbundled the two products in Europe in a bid to avert a
possible EU antitrust fine. The European Commission has been
investigating Microsoft’s tying of Office and Teams since a 2020
complaint by Salesforce-owned competing workspace messaging app Slack. ↫
Foo Yun Chee at Reuters I honestly misread this as Microsoft selling
Teams off, which would’ve been far bigger news. Unbundling Teams from
Office globally is just Microsoft applying its recent European Union
policy to the rest of the world. All we need now is Microsoft to stop
trying to make Teams for families and friends happen, because nobody
will ever want to use Teams for anything, let alone personal use.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Every computer has at least one heart which beats the cadence to all
the other chips. The CloCK output pin is connected to a copper line
which spreads to most components, into their CLK input pin. If you are
mostly a software person like me, you may have never noticed it but all
kinds of processors have a CLK input pin. From CPUs (Motorola 68000,
Intel Pentium, MOS 6502), to custom graphic chips (Midway’s DMA2, Capcom
CPS-A/CPS-B, Sega’s Genesis VDP) to audio chips (Yamaha 2151, OKI
msm6295), they all have one. ↫ Fabien Sanglard I’ve watched enough
Adrian Black that I already knew all of this, and I’m assuming so did
many of you. But hey, I’ll never pass up the opportunity to link to the

<p>
Pino now has all-new chainplates! We removed the original ones earlier
this month to inspect them and found some pit corrosion(as well as a
small crack), replacing them was necessary. With the chainplates gone,
we removed the entire starboard side cabinet to see what was behind
it—it’s always nice to see parts of our boat we’ve never seen. We also
replaced 3 old halyards on Pino. Devine earned themself a couple of
blisters

<p>
Sejo revisited the
<a href="https://compudanzas.net/maintenance_practice.html" target="_blank">Uxn
tutorial</a>, and appended corrections. The most important change is
that the tutorial is now targeting the
<a href="https://metasyn.srht.site/learn-uxn/" target="_blank">learn-uxn
platform</a>(online) maintained by
<a href="https://metasyn.pw/" target="_blank">metasyn</a>. Now, people
can jump right in and experiment without having to set up a dev
environment. Tsoding, someone who can code in front of the camera in a
language they’ve never used or read the docs for, did a pretty funny
session in Uxntal, you can watch it

<h2 id="pay-per-scroll">Pay per scroll</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;7.40 am. I’m sitting on a rock. Birds are chirping. Annoying rain coming down the gray sky. The rock I’m sitting on is wet. That’s also annoying. I’m sitting here, watching my dog walking up and down, destroying all the sticks that are lying on the ground. It’s a chilled morning.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Anyway, I’m sitting here, typing this on my phone. I have my phone with
me. I shouldn’t. I should have a book with me. But it’s raining. And
books don’t go along well with rain.
</p>
<p>
Books are interesting objects. The entire consumption process of a book
is interesting, especially when compared to websites. There’s no
equivalent of the web for books. There’s no place where an infinite
supply of books is available to you at virtually no cost. Reading a book
involves some decision-making and, more often than not, some financial
investment.
</p>
<p>
Sure, some of you are probably saying that libraries are the equivalent
of the web for books but that’s not the same thing. And don’t get me
wrong, libraries are great!
</p>
<p>
Reflecting on books made me think about what the web would look like if
it was some sort of pay-per-scroll platform. Not a place where virtually
everything is free but a place where everything has to be purchased in
order to be consumed. Which sites would I be willing to pay for? I’m
going to ignore the obvious answers because I’m sure almost everyone
would have sites like Wikipedia or YouTube. Those are boring answers.
Aggregators such as Hacker News or Reddit would also not be something
I’d be interested in paying for because the actual content lives
somewhere else. So I’d be paying just for the commentary.
</p>
<p>
In my case, I’d probably pay for two types of websites: either personal
sites of people that do things I enjoy or that have interesting takes on
the world or sites that collect content coming from a diverse group of
people (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com">LessWrong</a> is a good
example).
</p>
<p>
Would I be happy if the web was some sort of à la carte menu rather than
a free buffet? I’d say no. Still, thinking about this made me
realize—once again—that my media diet is something that I have to always
keep in mind. It also reminded me that I’m not reading enough books!

<h2 id="ora2pg-24.3-have-been-released">Ora2Pg 24.3 have been
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Bangkok, Thailand - March 29th, 2024
</p>
<h2>
Ora2Pg
</h2>
<p>
Version 24.3 of Ora2Pg, a free and reliable tool used to migrate an
Oracle database to PostgreSQL, has been officially released and is
publicly available for download.
</p>
<p>
This release fixes several issues reported since last release and
especially a regression in GEOMETRY data export. As usual, it also adds
some new features and improvements.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Add new configuration directive <code>ORACLE_FDW_PREFETCH</code> to
control the “prefetch” used by oracle_fdw COPY/INSERT. Prior to this
change Ora2Pg uses the default “prefetch” of oracle_fdw, which at the
time of writing is 50. Allowing this to be controlled by an Ora2Pg
configuration/option gives the option of increased performance at the
cost of some additional memory on the PostgreSQL side.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add new configuration directive <code>PGTT_NOSUPERUSER</code>. By
default the pgtt extension is loaded using the superuser privilege when
<code>EXPORT_GTT</code> is activated. Enabled it if you run the SQL
scripts generated using a non superuser user. It will use: <code>LOAD
‘$libdir/plugins/pgtt’;</code> instead of <code>LOAD ‘pgtt’;</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Backward compatibility changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Modify the behavior of triggers export with <code>EXPORT_INVALID</code>.
It used to apply to <code>ENABLED</code> or <code>DISABLED</code>
triggers instead of real <code>VALID</code> or <code>INVALID</code>
triggers. Export of invalid triggers will be controlled by
<code>EXPORT_INVALID</code> like others objects like functions,
packages, etc. This mean that disabled triggers that are valid will be
exported by default now, this was not the case before.
</li>
</ul>

more than just code</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>As some of the dust around the xz backdoor is slowly starting to
settle, we’ve been getting a pretty clear picture of what, exactly,
happened, and it’s not pretty. This is a story of the sole maintainer of
a crucial building block of the open source stack having mental health
issues, which at least partly contributes to a lack of interest in
maintaining xz. It seems a coordinated campaign – consensus seems to
point to a state actor – is then started to infiltrate xz, with the goal
of inserting a backdoor into the project. Evan Boehs has done the
legwork of diving into the mailing lists and commit logs of various
projects and the people involved, and it almost reads like the nerd
version of a spy novel. It involves seemingly fake users and accounts
violently pressuring the original xz maintainer to add a second
maintainer; a second maintainer who mysteriously seems to appear at
around the same time, like a saviour. This second maintainer manages to
gain the original maintainer’s trust, and within months, this mysterious
newcomer more or less takes over as the new maintainer. As the new
maintainer, this person starts adding the malicious code in question.
Sockpuppet accounts show up to add code to oss-fuzz to try and make sure
the backdoor won’t be detected. Once all the code is in place for the
backdoor to function, more fake accounts show up to push for the
compromised versions of xz to be included in Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu,
and possibly others. Roughly at this point, the backdoor is discovered
entirely by chance because Andres Freund noticed his SSH logins felt a
fraction of a second slower, and he wanted to know why. What seems to
have happened here is a bad actor – again, most likely a state actor –
finding and targeting a vulnerable maintainer, who, through clever
social engineering on both a personal level as well as the project
level, gained control over a crucial but unexciting building block of
the open source stack. Once enough control and trust was gained, the bad
actor added a backdoor to do… Well, something. It seems nobody really
knows yet what the ultimate goal was, but we can all make some educated
guesses and none of them are any good. When we think of vulnerabilities
in computer software, we tend to focus on bugs and mistakes that
unintentionally create the conditions wherein someone with malicious
intent can do, well, malicious things. We don’t often consider the
possibility of maintainers being malicious, secretly adding backdoors
for all kinds of nefarious purposes. The problem the xz backdoor
highlights is that while we have quite a few ways to prevent, discover,
mitigate, and fix unintentional security holes, we seem to have pretty
much nothing in place to prevent intentional backdoors placed by trusted
maintainers. And this is a real problem. There are so many utterly
crucial but deeply boring building blocks all over the open source
stacks pretty much the entire computing world makes use of that it has
become a meme, spearheaded by xkcd’s classic comic. The weakness in many
of these types of projects is not the code, but the people maintaining
that code, most likely through no fault of their own. There are so many
things life can throw at you that would make you susceptible to social
engineering – money problems, health problems, mental health issues,
burnout, relationship problems, god knows what else – and the open
source community has nothing in place to help maintainers of obscure but
crucial pieces of infrastructure deal with problems like these. That’s
why I’m suggesting the idea of setting up a foundation – or whatever
legal entity makes sense – that is dedicated to helping maintainers who
face the kinds of problems like the maintainer of xz did. A place where
a maintainer who is dealing with problems outside of the code repository
can go to for help, advice, maybe even financial and health assistance
if needed. Even if all this foundation offers to someone is a person to
talk to in confidence, it might mean the difference between burning out
completely, or recovering at least enough to then possibly find other
ways to improve one’s situation. If someone is burnt-out or has a mental
health crisis, they could contact the foundation, tell their story, and
say, hey, I need a few months to recover and deal with my problems, can
we put out a call among already trusted members of the open source
community to step in for me for a while? Keep the ship steady as she
goes without rocking it until I get back or we find someone to take over
permanently? This way, the wider community will also know the regular,
trusted maintainer is stepping down for a while, and that any new
commits should be treated with extra care, solving the problem of some
unknown maintainer of an obscure but important package suffering in
obscurity, the only hints found in the low-volume mailing list well
after something goes wrong. The financial responsibility for such a
safety net should undoubtedly be borne by the long list of ultra-rich
megacorporations who profit off the backs of these people toiling away
in obscurity. The financial burden for something like this would be
pocket change to the likes of Google, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and so on,
but could make a contribution to open source far greater than any code
dump. Governments could probably be involved too, but that will most
likely open up a whole can of worms, so I’m not sure if that would be a
good idea. I’m not proposing this be some sort of glorified ATM where
people can go to get some free money whenever they feel like it. The
goal should be to help people who form crucial cogs in the delicate
machinery of computing to live healthy, sustainable lives so their code
and contributions to the community don’t get compromised. This</p>

significant performance and correctness improvements to the kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>This year, there have been numerous improvements both to the kernel’s
correctness, as well as raw performance. The signal and TLB shootdown
MRs have significantly improved kernel memory integrity and possibly
eliminated many hard-to-debug and nontrivial heisenbugs. Nevertheless,
there is still a lot of work to be done optimizing and fixing bugs in
relibc, in order to improve compatibility with ported applications, and
most importantly of all, getting closer to a self-hosted Redox. ↫ Jacob
Lorentzon (4lDO2) I love how much of the focus for Redox seems to be on
the lower levels of the operating system, because it’s something many
projects tend to kind of forget to highlight, to spend more time on new
icons or whatever. These in-depth Redox articles are always informative,
and have me very excited about Redox’ future. Obviously, Redox is on the
list of operating systems I need to write a proper article about. I’m
not sure if there’s enough for a full review or if it’ll be more of a
short look – we’ll see when we get there.</p>

11 may get a highly requested Start menu redesign, here is how to try
it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>In October 2023, we published a recap of the top 10 features Windows
11 users want for the redesigned Start menu. Number 6 was the ability to
switch from list view to grid view in the “All Apps” list, which
received over 1,500 upvotes in the Feedback Hub. Six months later,
Microsoft finally appears to be ready to give users what they want.
PhantomOfEarth, the ever-giving source of hidden stuff in Windows 11
preview builds, discovered that Windows 11 build 22635.3420 lets you
change from list to grid view in the “All Apps” section. Like other
unannounced features, this one requires a bit of tinkering using the
ViVeTool app until Microsoft makes it official. ↫ Taras Buria I’m still
baffled Microsoft consistently manages to mess up something as
once-iconic and impactful like the Start menu. It seems like Microsoft
just can’t leave it well enough alone, even though it kind of already
nailed it in Windows 95 – just give us that, but with a modern search
function, and we’re all going to be happy. That’s it. We don’t want or
need more.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-write">Why I write</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The other day I was asked why I have a blog, why I write. Hard questions to answer. I don’t really know why I’m doing all this. I know why I started back in 2017. But the reason why I started is long gone at this point. I started the blog as some sort of public accountability tool and it’s now everything but that. I don’t write to be accountable. I probably should.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
The more I write on this site, the more I realize that what I’m trying
to do is to connect. I’m trying to connect with others—with you—but I’m
also trying to help others connect with each other. And, in a weird way,
I’m also trying to connect with myself.
</p>
<p>
It’s why I find it so enjoyable to share other people’s projects on this
site. It’s why I’m happy to remind you that March is almost over and if
you haven’t already you should write something for this month’s
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">IndieWeb
Carnival</a>. It’s also why I’m finding most of the current web so
annoying and distasteful. The endless self-promotion, the attempt to
grow a persona, the lack of authenticity. Everything becomes
transactional and something is lost in the process.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I’m a nobody. I’m just a random person with a website like countless
others out there. There’s nothing special about what I’m doing here and
that’s how it should be. Sharing what we find interesting shouldn’t be
some special activity. Being kind to one another should be the norm.
We’re social creatures. Connecting with others is a great way to grow
and improve as human beings. This is probably why I’m writing. To become
a better me.

<h2 id="convert-text-file-to-pdf">2024-03-27 Convert text file to

<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-03-27-convert-text-file-to-pdf">
2024-03-27 Convert text file to PDF
</h1>
<p>
I just couldn’t find a good way to turn a text file into a PDF. Within
Emacs, <code>ps-print-buffer</code> is hard to configure and my two
specific problems were the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
everything is turned into Latin-1 so I cannot use the EN dash;
</li>
<li>
the line length was set too short so that I couldn’t print lines longer
than 80 characters even though there was plenty of space left.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wasted some time trying to write something in Bash, turned to Perl and
wasted some more time trying to figure out why the encodings were all
wrong except when the encodings were OK but Perl gave me a warning for
every multi-byte character. So frustrating.
</p>
<p>
The solution ended up not being decoding and encoding the bytes in the
Perl script but to use the <code>–encoding</code> option for
<code>weasyprint</code>. In this case, it wasn’t Perl’s fault, it was my
fear of Perl’s encoding issues that led my down endless variations of
<code>binmode</code>, <code>:utf8</code>, <code>decode_utf8</code> and
<code>encode_utf8</code>. But I think I have it, now.
</p>
<p>
This is what I ended up with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
use <code>weasyprint</code>;
</li>
<li>
wrap it all in a <code>pre</code> tag.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I created a script called <code>to-pdf</code> with the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Modern::Perl;
use File::Basename;

if (@ARGV == 0) {
  die &quot;Usage: to-pdf file.txt ...\n&quot;;
}

for (@ARGV) {
  open(my $text, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $_) or die &quot;Cannot read $_\n&quot;;
  my ($name, $path, $suffix) = fileparse($_, &quot;.txt&quot;);
  open(my $html, &quot;|-&quot;) || exec &quot;weasyprint&quot;, &quot;--encoding&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;$path$name.pdf&quot;;

  print $html &lt;&lt;'BEG';
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family: Iosevka; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;
BEG

  for (&lt;$text&gt;) { print $html $_ }; # copy text

  print $html &lt;&lt;'END';
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
END
}

80s-era automotive navigation computer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I imported a Japanese-market 4×4 van into the
US; a 1996 Mitsubishi Delica. Based on the maps I found in the seat
pocket and other clues, it seems to have spent its life at some city
dweller’s cabin in the mountains around Fukushima, and only driven
occasionally. Despite being over 25 years old, it only had 77,000 km on
the odometer. The van had some interesting old tech installed in it:
what appears to be a radar detector labeled “Super Eagle ✔️30” and a
Panasonic-brand electronic toll collection device that you can insert a
smart card into. One particularly noteworthy accessory that was
available in mid-90s Delicas was a built-in karaoke machine for the rear
passengers. Sadly, mine didn’t have that feature. But the most
interesting accessory installed in the van was the Avco Maptwin Inter,
which I immediately identified as some kind of electronic navigation
aid, about which there is very little information available on the
English-language internet. When I first saw the Maptwin, I had thought
it might be some kind of proto-GPS that displayed latitude/longitude
coordinates that you could look up on a paper map. Alas, it’s not that
cool. It was not connected to any kind of antenna, and the electronics
inside seem inadequate for the reception of a GPS signal. The Maptwin
was, however, wired into an RPM counter that was attached between the
transmission and the speedometer cable, presumably to delivery extremely
accurate and convenient display of how many kilometers have been
traveled since the display was last reset. What I’ve been able to learn
is that the Maptwin is computer that was mostly used for rally race
navigation, precursor to devices still available from manufacturers like
Terra Trip. Now, the Mitsubishi Delica is about the best 4×4 minivan you
can get, but it’s extremely slow and unwieldy at speed, so it would be
pretty terrible for rally racing. My best guess is that the owner used
this device as a navigation aid for overland exploration, as the name
“Maptwin” implies, to augment the utility of a paper map. On the other
hand, I found an article that indicates that some kinds of rallies were
not high speed affairs, but rather accuracy-based navigation puzzles of
sorts, so who knows? The Maptwin wasn’t working when I got the van, and
I don’t know if it’s actually broken or just needs to be wired up
correctly. If any OSNews readers have any additional information about
any of the devices I’ve mentioned, please enlighten us in the comments.
If anyone would like to try to get the Maptwin working and report back,
please let me know.</p>
