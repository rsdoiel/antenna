date: 2024-01-23, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

<em>This post was updated Jan. 23 at 11:50 p.m.&#160;</em>
Over a dozen student activists from across the UC system launched a hunger strike Tuesday, hoping to pressure the UC Board of Regents to follow through on its promises to open on-campus employment opportunities for the University’s nearly 4,000 students without legal status.&#160;
The escalation is the latest development in the “Opportunity for All” campaign backed by progressive legal scholars and undocumented student organizers, which was launched in October 2022 at UCLA.
