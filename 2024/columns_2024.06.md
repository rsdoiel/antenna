## Why I preach to the choir

date: 2024-02-05, from: Robert Reich's blog

## A New ’Joy‘ in Jazz

date: 2024-02-04, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Samara Joy has been called the new voice of jazz, a vocal phenom, a savior of the genre. This young lady is &#8220;joy&#8221; personified and today&#8217;s reason to smile, from her stunning jazz singing to her megawatt smile. The 24-year-old jazz sensation from the Bronx surprised a lot of people at last year&#8217;s Grammy Awards when she won not only Best Jazz Vocal Album but also Best New Artist, an award given only three times to a jazz artist. She will be back at the Grammys tonight as a presenter and again as a nominee. Take a listen to her incredible improvisation on the Grammy-nominated song &#8220;Tight.&#8221;
