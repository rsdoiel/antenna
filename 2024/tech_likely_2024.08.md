## NASA’s New Horizons Detects Dusty Hints of Extended Kuiper Belt

date: 2024-02-20, from: NASA breaking news

New observations from NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft hint that the Kuiper Belt – the vast, distant outer zone of our solar system populated by hundreds of thousands of icy, rocky planetary building blocks – might stretch much farther out than we thought.

## Ski boot sizing

<p>One thing that's great about ChatGPT is they can help you make a decision in an area you lack expertise and where there is no human you can ask for help making the decision. It's making this human smarter, and it's hard to see the downside of that. </p>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/be9ca3a4-4e74-4fe0-a778-d5595fe8482d">example</a>. I'm trying to decide whether I should get size 11 rental ski boots or size 11.5. The person behind the counter at the rental place isn't capable of having a long conversation about this, where I get to ask two follow-up questions. </p>
<p>Instead they would say sorry, what size did you say you wanted sir? </p>

## The surprising truth about pixels and accessibility

date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News

Should web developers use pixels or ems/rems for accessible fonts? It&#8217;s an emotionally-charged question because there are a lot of conflicting opinions out there, and it can be overwhelming. Maybe you&#8217;ve heard that rems are better for accessibility. Or maybe you&#8217;ve heard that the problem is fixed and pixels are fine? The truth is, if you want to build the most-accessible product possible, you need to use both pixels and ems/rems. It&#8217;s not an either/or situation. There are circumstances where rems are more accessible, and other circumstances where pixels are more accessible. ↫ Joshua Comeau The linked article isn&#8217;t just an explanation of why, but also a tutorial.

## Reddit sells training data to unnamed AI company ahead of IPO

date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News

On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Reddit has signed a contract allowing an unnamed AI company to train its models on the site&#8217;s content, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes as the social media platform nears the introduction of its initial public offering (IPO), which could happen as soon as next month. Reddit initially revealed the deal, which is reported to be worth $60 million a year, earlier in 2024 to potential investors of an anticipated IPO, Bloomberg said. The Bloomberg source speculates that the contract could serve as a model for future agreements with other AI companies. ↫ Benj Edwards at Ars Technica Properly paying for the content you&#8217;re feeding into your &#8220;AI&#8221; model is a huge improvement over just taking it without users&#8217; consent, but it does add yet another area of concern for users of all kinds of platforms. Whatever you write, create, or post might be fed into &#8220;AI&#8221; models without you ever realising it, and while the platform you use gets paid for that, you aren&#8217;t. In any event, OSNews is not selling your comments to an &#8220;AI&#8221; company, but with how old we are, there&#8217;s no doubt both your comments and our stories have already found their way into countless &#8220;AI&#8221; black holes.

## GhostBSD 24.01.1 released

date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News

This new release is based on FreeBSD 14.0-STABLE. Update Station got a significant change to upgrade to a major FreeBSD version, allowing upgrading GhostBSD from 13.2-STABLE to 14.0-STABLE. Also, a major change to the installer is the user created is an admin, and the root user gets the same password as the admin. If the admin password is changed after the installation, the root password will not change. ↫ GhostBSD&#8217;s website GhostBSD is a user-friendly, desktop-first &#8216;distribution&#8217; of FreeBSD &#8211; a project which, in my humble view, should be part of the FreeBSD project-proper. With some old-time Linux feeling a sense of disenfranchisement towards Linux due to things like Wayland and systemd, FreeBSD could serve as an excellent alternative, and an official desktop-first ISO could play a role in that. Of course, that&#8217;s not exactly core to FreeBSD&#8217;s mission, and they really shouldn&#8217;t be listening to idiots like me, but I think it&#8217;s an idea worth pondering.

## My TODO list is a .txt file on the desktop

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">My TODO list is a .txt file on the desktop</span>

<p>It was beyond its breaking point for a few years, actually... ever since I my average daily email volume increase from maybe 5-10 'important' emails to deal with to 50+.</p>

<p>My email-based TODO system used to go like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Email myself things I deemed important enough to do the next day</li>
<li>Next morning, when I checked my email, knock off the top item in that list, and try to work down the list a bit</li>
<li>Anything else, forward that email again for the next day</li>
</ol>

<p>Once an item got maybe 5-10 <code>Fwd:</code>s in the Subject line, I would decide whether to nix the TODO item entirely, or move it off into a Trello board—in either case, likely to be forgotten forever.</p>

<p>I didn't say the system was <em>good</em>.</p>

## Fully documented source code for Lander on the Acorn Archimedes

date: 2024-02-19, from: OS News

This site contains reconstructed source code for Lander, David Braben&#8217;s epic game for the Acorn Archimedes, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained. Lander was the very first game to be released for the ARM processor, and it is both a milestone and a masterpiece. My hope is that this site will be useful for those who want to learn more about Lander and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate the second classic game from this legend of 3D coding (the first classic being Elite, of course). ↫ Mark Moxon An incredibly valuable resource.

## ALL EYES ON US –  A Companion Piece

date: 2024-02-19, from: Care


                <p>Transition is infinite motion. To transition is to sit in the inescapable space between violence and possibility. It is to both mourn death and revere life – to feel the ache of a burning body and still insist on the exigency of something beyond. Dharmaraj surveys contemporary Black trans scholarship, engages with anti-caste scholarship and reconsiders makeup as a holy act.</p>

Now I'm factoring into my thinking and planning that there will be a rebirth in blogging, because I see there are people willing to work on making the systems work together in new interesting ways. That's what it's going to take -- we have to capture the imaginations of the smartest web writers. And the only thing that's going to get their attention is developers working together to create new experiences for everyone. Now I believe it's going to happen.

<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/293">Random thought</a> -- maybe the fastest way to get full ActivityPub support for WordPress is to offer a feature in any WP site to cross-post to a Mastodon gateway operated by Automattic. It's possible I don't understand the problem of course. But Mastodon is open source, so it's not like depending on another vendor to do this for you. And then you avoid all the hassles with having to say what part of the protocol is ActivityPub and what part is Mastodon's API.

## I look forward to dumping Trump again

date: 2024-02-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've mostly kept Trump off the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of this blog since he left office in 2021, but things are changing, and this is shaping up as a Trump year. I read today in the NYT that the resistance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/us/politics/trump-resistance-democrats-voters.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Wk0.0hoY.duTfLtk_PUxj&smid=url-share">is exhausted</a>. Bullshit. We're very well rested. Anyway I look forward to once again, pretending Trump doesn't exist, next year or the year after, Murphy-willing. </p>
<p>The other day when I was skiing at <a href="https://www.belleayre.com/">Belleayre</a>, I got to ride up on a chairlift with a Trump supporter. He told me he got Covid but it wasn't a big deal, just like a cold. I said a lot of people died from Covid. He said most were already sick or overweight. I said yeah but they deserve to live too. He said he didn't get vaccinated, he doesn't like to put drugs in his body. What bullshit I muttered under my breath. I looked at him, maybe ten years younger than me. From New Jersey, a house painter. I said that my life has been saved by drugs at least twice, once when I was perfectly healthy other than having a ruptured appendix at 9 years old. I also said you're really lucky not to have needed medical care, but before you die I bet you will. And I thought to myself but didn't say out loud that what about your parents and grandparents, siblings even children? Have they all been perfectly healthy until they died? Anyway a chairlift is not a safe place for real anger, but -- you also can't walk away from the other person. There's a lot of soul-sharing on rides like that.  </p>

## Episode 126 - IBM Compatible (No, Not Those)

<div class="DraftEditor-paragraphElement" data-block="true" data-editor="7rkqf" data-offset-key="1knr0-0-0"> <div class= "public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="1knr0-0-0"><span data-offset-key= "1knr0-0-0"><span data-text="true">This episode wraps up the System/360 trilogy by taking things back to where they started for me. We will be looking at System/360 clones, how they could exist, why they existed, and why IBM didn't crush them. We close with a discussion of how these earlier clones impact our understanding of the IBM PC story. The truth is, by 1981 IBM was no stranger to clones.

## Pinning nixpkgs with Morph and Colmena

date: 2024-02-18, from: Nora Tindall's blog

I&rsquo;ve used NixOS and Morph to manage the servers in my house for about a year now, and while I have many gripes with both the Nix language and the documentation around the nixpkgs and NixOS ecosystem, it&rsquo;s been a great help.
This post is for users of Morph and its near-drop-in replacement, Colmena. If you don&rsquo;t already use one of these tools, take a look at them first!
Why Pin nixpkgs?

## 2024-02-18 We’re in Valais again

date: 2024-02-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-18 We’re in Valais again</h1>

<p>Oh yeah. Hiking down on the valley floor. There’s a nice dry forest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pfynwald or Bois de Finges is a natural reserve and one of the largest continuous Scots pine forests of Europe. It is located on the language border between German- and French-speaking Valais, Switzerland, on the alluvial cone below the Illgraben valley. – <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfynwald">Pfynwald</a>, on Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trail started along site names like Hexenplatz (witche&rsquo;s square) and Galgenweg (gallow way). Creepy.</p>

<p>The forest was nice, though. Very different from the forest we have around Zürich.</p>

<p>It is dry and coniferous.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A trail leads through a dry forest with snow covered mountains in the back.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The trail continues.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illgraben">Illgraben</a>.
It is very unstable. Wikipedia says there are mudflows two or three times a year.</p>

<p>No water is visible but there&rsquo;s a big scar in the ground.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking into the Illgraben we see how the edge keeps crumbling. There&rsquo;s a barrier made of twigs whenever the trail comes close to the edge.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is the Bhutan bridge, designed by engineers and blessed by priests living in France.
It is a result of 2002 being the <a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/263509">International Year of Mountains</a>.
It&rsquo;s a hanging bridge that crosses the Illgraben.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Surprisingly, there are actually tracks of some sort of construction vehicle in the valley.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We saw some <em>Hepatica nobilis</em> (Leberblümchen).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-8.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-9.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A rock covered in moss.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A huge rock cliff rising behind the forest.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A tree felled by beavers.
We loved that water-logged part of the hike.
We didn&rsquo;t see any beavers, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-13.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There were two stone towers we saw. I fear these were built for hermits. What a shit way to spend the few days you have in life.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-14.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the sun begins to set, we see the industrial zone of Sierre.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-15.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Just as we were about to leave the forest, we saw <em>Pulsatilla vulgaris</em> (Küchenschelle).</p>

## On dreams and goals

date: 2024-02-18, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>I don’t know about you but I spent most of my life not knowing what I wanted to do. I never had dreams or big goals. Never had a dream job, never aimed for something specific. I spent most of my life drifting through it, without trying to stir the ship all that much. I don’t know why I did it, it’s probably because of the kind of person I am. I never knew what I wanted to do, but I think I do now. It only took me 34 years, 7 months, and 12 days.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, my mind has slowly pieced things together. I stumbled on this profession of website maker almost at random and in the same random way I found myself starting a blog. I had no idea what I was doing back then, and I still don’t, to be totally honest with you. This blog is a bizarre mix of rants and half-baked thoughts on whatever topic is floating in my mind at any given moment.</p>
<p>But through this mix of random events, I stumbled on something great. I stumbled on you. Yes, you, the person reading this. You represent everything that’s great about the web and personal websites. You are a gateway through which I can access new places, and new realities. You are an opportunity to learn new things, and to expand my horizons.</p>
<p>Being able to interact with people is by far the best outcome of this website. And I think more people should be able to experience that. Because it’s important. And that’s my goal. That’s what I decided I want to try to do more of. I want to try, as much as I can, to help people go online with a personal website they own. That’s why I made <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms">that list of blog platforms the other day</a>, that’s also why I’m going to make available a few blog designs I coded a while back. But it’s also why I’m going to keep encouraging people to ditch social media, and why I’m going to spend time replying to every single person that gets in touch with me. And it’s also why I’m going to start designing and coding bespoke websites, for free. I’m not going to be able to make a ton of those unfortunately because, as you can imagine, I have to earn money somehow, and that somehow is doing client work that will consume most of my days.</p>
<p>The title of this post mentions dreams though, not just goals. The goal is to spend as much time as possible helping people ditching social media and going online with personal websites. The dream is for that to be my actual full-time job. A job that’s entirely supported by the kindness and the generosity of the people who decide to join my <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">One a Month</a> membership thingy.</p>
<p>Can that dream become a reality? Hard for me to say. As of right now, some very generous people are providing around 5% of what I need to earn every month to live my normal life and I’m incredibly grateful for that.</p>
<p>That’s my goal, that’s my dream. I’m genuinely happy to have finally figured it out and I’m grateful to the people who have helped me come to this realization. You can expect more weird experiments in the upcoming months and if you need help going online with your website, please, <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">get in touch</a>. I’m happy to help. And if you can and want to support this bizarre life mission, consider joining the <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">One a Month club</a>.</p>

## 2024-02-17 The log is not the text

date: 2024-02-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-17 The log is not the text</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Waiting for the bus. Italian kids on speed doing superhero moves behind my back and the parents are not in control. I am distracting myself by writing up a fediverse thread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was talking with <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a>, <a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@splitbrain" title="@splitbrain@octodon.social">@splitbrain</a> and <a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org">@phf</a> about git logs. I claimed the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Git does not have wiki culture. If I could rebase and squash and edit to my hearts delight, that would work for me. But git has blockchain culture: write once, append only, no take-backs, and I don’t like it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason I say this is because the artefact I’m interested in is the git log as a readable text. When I need to upgrade software such as Mojolicious or GoToSocial, I often look at a release page, but I hardly every look at the details. I don’t care for long lists of issues and I certainly do not read the git log.</p>

<p>My claim is that the git log is useless for the purposes of learning about new features added or migrations to run during upgrades. And my own commit logs are just as useless because I don’t dare edit and squash the history. The git log is simply a comment for the edits made to the code and does not serve as a replacement for release notes, as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>So, while it is true that the wiki history is not edited either, the wiki text as the readable end-product is in fact edited. The git log and its messages are not.</p>

<p>I guess I’m an undisciplined programmer who is convinced the feature is done and then discovers an edge case, and the I realize I forgot the docs, and then I find a better way to describe it, oh and here is a test that makes sense, oh and I found a typo and here is a grammar fix. It’s hard for me to know when the feature is done-done. There never is a good point where I think to myself: Now is a good point to merge.</p>

<p>This is just like buying and selling stock. It is hard to know what the future brings. All that you can do is try and make sure there are no catastrophic failures when things go wrong.</p>

<p>The Perl code archive (CPAN) suggests a <code>Changes</code> file. I think I’ll try that.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a></p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> left the following comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Git does not have wiki culture. […] But git has blockchain culture</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not quite what you started with. I said git has wiki culture. Git makes the entire software world one big wiki. I had just been reflecting on that earlier, finally having fixed* a long standing bug in markdowku. That’s such a marvel to me, that thanks to git I could make a version that works for me and my friends and I could send the fix upstream so they could apply it or not. When I see a typo or error on a webpage, if that webpage is a wiki, I can fix, I can fix! And thanks to git, it makes even more things be like wikis in that regard.</p>

<p>Git is not a linear line of append append append. It’s a flexible bowl of paperclips, malleable, friendly, it helps me, it’s my friend. If upstream doesn’t merge I’m still gonna be OK. I love git. Don’t slag it.</p>

<p>And the log isn’t just linear either: it makes the source repo be like a wiki in that there’s both a global “recent changes” and a local “page history” for each file, even each line with a good blame viewer.</p>

<p>Now, is documentation outside of the log, for migrations for example, a good idea? Yes. We want README and INSTALL and TODO and COPYING, we want docs. Never disputed that.</p>

<p>*: here’s hoping 🤞🏻</p>

<hr>

<p>Sandra is right, of course.
The original conversation went something like this:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Alex</dt>
<dd>I guess I should start writing some sort of release notes with user-visible changes for Oddmu, my wiki/blog/memex/static site generator…</dd>
<dt>Sandra</dt>
<dd>Don’t worry we have git log</dd>
<dt>Alex</dt>
<dd>all I know is that I never look at git log of other projects</dd>
<dt>Sandra</dt>
<dd>git log of other projects is like 99% of my reading</dd>
<dt>Alex</dt>
<dd>wow, sounds like IT hell!
Or perhaps my own commit log is just so badly written. And the only commits I know are from the office and they are the worst.</dd>
<dt>Sandra</dt>
<dd>Git logs are wiki culture</dd>
<dt>Alex</dt>
<dd>If I could rebase and squash and edit to my hearts delight, that would work for me. But git has blockchain culture, write once, append only, no take-backs, and I don’t like it. So effectively I’d like a user-facing Changes file.</dd>
<dt>Sandra</dt>
<dd>Like I do 💁🏻‍♀️
Living the dream</dd>

## WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT DESIRE

date: 2024-02-18, from: Howard Jacobson blog

If you haven&#8217;t started to watch Jack and Alice on Channel 4 television, I recommend you do so. Catch it by whatever means. Not soon. Not tomorrow. Now. But, if you must put it off, go first to St James&#8217;s Park or some comparable place where you can observe the pelicans. Love is in the air and the pelicans are feeling it. Watch pelicans mate - in particular watch the large male fasten his beak, in what looks like an act of murder, about the neck of the sedentary female - and you realise how much you have still to learn about the mysteries of desire. Then run home and catch

## Running GNU on DOS with DJGPP

date: 2024-02-18, from: OS News

I remember using DJGPP back in the 1990s before I had been exposed to Linux and feeling that it was a strange beast. Compared to the Microsoft C Compiler and Turbo C++, the tooling was bloated and alien to DOS, and the resulting binaries were huge. But DJGPP provided a complete development environment for free, which I got from a monthly magazine, and I could even look at its source code if I wished. You can’t imagine what a big deal that was at the time. But even if I could look under the cover, I never did. I never really understood why was DJGPP so strange, slow, and huge, or why it even existed. Until now. As I’m in the mood of looking back, I’ve spent the last couple of months figuring out what the foundations of this software were and how it actually worked. Part of this research has resulted in the previous two posts on DOS memory management. And part of this research is this article. Let’s take a look! ↫ Julio Merino Having access to tools such as this, including the source code, must&#8217;ve been a huge deal to a lot of people, even if ti was &#8220;strange, slow, and huge&#8221; as the author notes.
