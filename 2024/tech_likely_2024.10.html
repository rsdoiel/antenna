<h2 id="running-cpm-on-the-c128">Running CP/M on the C128</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>I owned a C64 and was familiar with the C128, but this one was odd.
It wasn’t running any games, color graphics or playing music. Instead,
it was connected to a monochrome monitor which always displayed either a
weird command line prompt or what seemed to be some boring professional
writing software. I soon came to find that it was running CP/M and
WordStar, one of the first word processors for microcomputers. My daily
obsessive visits to the computer shop led to some friendship with the
owner, to the point that he’d let me in and play with the machines. So,
I played with CP/M and learned how to use WordStar. Well, in case you
didn’t notice, I own a C128DCR now. This blog is about how I got CP/M,
WordStar, and other fun ancient software apps running on it. ↫ Celso
Martinho CP/M, of course, was the primary influence of DOS.</p>

id="facing-reality-whether-its-about-apple-or-the-eu-is-a-core-requirement-for-good-management">Facing
reality, whether it’s about Apple or the EU, is a core requirement for
good management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Baldur Bjarnason has written an excellent piece to explain why,
exactly, companies like Apple seem wholly incapable of working with the
EU, instead of against it. He argues – quite effectively – that Apple,
and US tech punditry in general, simply do not understand the EU, nor
are they willing to spend even 10 minutes to understand it, which is
really all you need. The core premise of the EU, its very primary
function, is to enable and protect the single market. A great example of
this is the ban on roaming charges – mobile phone carriers in EU are not
allowed to charge extra for using mobile voice and data services in
another EU country. From the EU’s perspective, taking action to prevent
private parties from fragmenting and taking private control over the
single market simultaneously grew the economy and increased consumer
surplus. This is the operating theory behind much of the actions the EU
takes regarding market regulation and product standardisation: a single
market built on standards is more profitable for both businesses and
consumers. ↫ Baldur Bjarnason And because Apple and its tech punditry
refuse to try and understand the party they are dealing with, they get
caught looking like childish idiots every time they open their mouths
about it. Normally when the EU regulates a given sector, it does so with
ample lead time and works with industry to make sure that they
understand their obligations. Apple instead thought that the regulatory
contact from the EU during the lead time to the DMA was an opportunity
for it to lecture the EU on its right to exist. Then its executives made
up some fiction in their own minds as to what the regulation meant,
announced their changes, only to discover later that they were full of
bullshit. This was entirely Apple’s own fault. For months, we’ve been
hearing leaks about Apple’s talks with the EU about the Digital Market
Act. Those talks were not negotiations even though Apple seems to have
thought they were. Talks like those are to help companies implement
incoming regulations, with some leeway for interpretation on the EU’s
side to accommodate business interests. Remember what I wrote about
electrical plugs? The EU is pro-business – often criticised for being
essentially a pro-business entity – and not in favour of regulation for
regulation’s sake. If Apple had faced reality and tried to understand
the facts as they are, they would have used the talks to clarify all of
these issues and more well in advance of the DMA taking effect. But they
didn’t because they have caught the tech industry management disease of
demanding that reality bend to their ideas and wishes. ↫ Baldur
Bjarnason What a lot of people – both inside and outside the EU – do not
grasp is that while we all know the EU has shortcomings and issues, in
general, the EU is uncharacteristically (for a government agency)
popular among EU citizens, no matter the country of origin. That’s
because we, as EU citizens, and especially as EU citizens who do
anything international, know just how ridiculously beneficial the EU has
been for trade, business, the economy, travel, and so much more. Apple
can keep acting like a whiny trust fund boy who thinks the world owes
them everything, but they’ll have to deal with the consequences.
Continued violation of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of
revenue. That’s 38 billion dollars. I secretly hope Apple keeps this
childish behaviour up. It’s deeply entertaining.</p>

crash tester says carmakers must bring back physical controls</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European organisation for crash testing and car safety, Euro NCAP
has announced that starting in 2026, cars will need physical controls in
their interiors to gain the highest safety ratings. “The overuse of
touchscreens is an industry-wide problem, with almost every
vehicle-maker moving key controls onto central touchscreens, obliging
drivers to take their eyes off the road and raising the risk of
distraction crashes,” said Matthew Avery, Euro NCAP’s director of
strategic development. “New Euro NCAP tests due in 2026 will encourage
manufacturers to use separate, physical controls for basic functions in
an intuitive manner, limiting eyes-off-road time and therefore promoting
safer driving,” he said. ↫ Jonathan M. Gitlin at Ars Technica Excellent
news, and it’s taken regulators and safety organisations way too long to
long to adapt to the growing menace of touch screens in cars.</p>

<h2 id="its-time-to-give-up-on-everything-but-email">It’s Time to Give
Up on Everything but Email</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I was sitting there, minding my own damn business, surfing the web,
clicking around, enjoying my time, when I stumbled on
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/email-nightmare-just-give-up/677615/">this
article</a>, by Ian Bogost on The Atlantic, that is so painfully stupid
that I had to take the time and comment on it. Because, as you know, I
love emails.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Finally, in step five, you must evangelize your mission. Email is a
public-health concern. Gently correct your mother when she tries to
correspond. Reprimand your email-happy colleagues. Punish email abuse by
withholding your replies. Or, more gently, darken someone’s doorway. In
short, you must show the sort of leadership that will encourage others
to forsake their email too. We’ll never stop the rain of email, no
matter what we do. But if we work together, maybe we can build a kind of
shelter.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The entire premise of this article is that email is an unmanageable mess
filled with all sorts of garbage and dealing with it is a lost cause.
There’s an analogy in there that is so idiotic that is worth quoting:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alas, there is no opting out from email. As a practical matter, your
inbox cannot be abandoned altogether. The same is true for postal mail:
To function within the normal bounds of contemporary society, you must
be addressable in physical space. You must be able to receive Amex bills
and Amazon baubles, and also, you must subject yourself to lots of junk.
This analogy between your home’s mailbox and your computer’s inbox is so
easily made that it’s often overlooked. Both are stuffed with garbage by
default, but also just a few essential messages.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ian, let me give you some shocking advice: unlike your physical address,
it’s not hard to get an extra email address. Hell, you can get even more
than one. You can go one step further and get a disposable one!
Shocking, I know!
</p>
<p>
In all seriousness, if in 2024 you’re using one single email address for
everything that’s a you problem, not an email problem. Also, Ian, let me
ask you a question: what’s the alternative here? Do we all move to
Slack/Discord/Teams? Do we all move everything to DMs? Do you think
that’s a better solution?
</p>
<p>
There’s a reason why emails are still here. They’re still here because
they work. Is email perfect? No. Is there a better alternative? Also no.

Nunn</a>: “I don’t understand how all the outcry about their bizarre and
defensive political coverage and the scary effect it can have on the
election is not a major investigative story being written by other
journalists. Not some fancy media critic opinion or an editorial. A real
report, taking defensiveness out of it and applying accountability.” A
regular reader of this blog will know how totally I agree with this. But
oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her
liking, she accused me of being a MAGA. It’s so totally not true, and
very typical of reporters, to use an ad hominem to not have to listen to
a non-journalist opinion about journalism. I have been a reader of the
NYT since I was a small child. I wanted to be a writer like

returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were
that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up
in Queens in the 1960s. We <i>all</i> have to work together to dig out
of the hole we’re in. And that means reporters have to start looking at
themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the
job that we need journalism to do, that it isn’t doing.</p>

<h1>
2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine
</h1>
<p>
If you’re wondering how Israel is going to come back after all this, I
suspect you already forgot how it managed to come back
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict">after
2006</a>. I’m not sure how that makes me feel. On the one hand, I have
completely checked out. The people in charge are utter villains. The
settlements, the cutting down of trees, the terrorizing, the things one
reads in the news if one cares to look are in a vague but emotionally
crushing and morally grinding way similar to how the territory of the US
was built on rape, murder, land grab, death marches and reservations. On
the other hand, I think we cannot let that hold us back from seeking a
better future. We must not stare at the bloody entrails left behind on
this road to war. Yes, the news is grim. We must look past it, however.
What comes after that? Where will we be in forty years? In twenty years?
In five years? In two years? Next year? How will it be better than this?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The disparity in conditions in the north and south is clear evidence
that aid restrictions in the north are costing lives. UNICEF and WFP
malnutrition screenings in the north in January found that nearly 16 per
cent - or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age - are acutely
malnourished. Similar screenings conducted in the south in Rafah, where
aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years
are acutely malnourished.” –

And if you think a solution is impossible, then take heart. The world
has managed to come back from two World Wars and countless other brutal
wars. Peace is possible. People are not inherently evil. Most people
want peace. Those in power and the people surrounding them and
supporting them often don’t want peace, however. And once the slaughter
starts, it’s hard to stop. Peace is hard.
</p>
<p>
Often the people arguing for war just can’t imagine peace because of
this detail or that detail. And the details are hard to get right, for
sure. But they are not impossible. Imagination is required. How else are
people going to make plans for after the war? The war will end one day.
And those who survived will be following plans that somebody imagined.
It is important to imagine a happy, prosperous future and then to make
plans of how to get there.
</p>
<p>
I remember how I was a German speaking kid in Portugal in the eighties
and sometimes I’d be greeted by an angry “Heil Hitler!” from kids my
age. And Portugal wasn’t even in the war! But all the killing takes
generations to forgive and forget. The longer it takes us to get to
peace, the longer it will take to forgive. And once there is peace, we
must not squander it. We need to work for it. We need to keep aiming for
that happy, prosperous future and stick to plans that go there. Don’t
follow leaders without a clear plan. If they don’t have one, they don’t
care or they’re unwilling to listen. There are many people with plans
for peace. It’s just that the road is hard. And yet, that is the road we
have.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stop the killing.
</li>
<li>
Respect human rights.
</li>
<li>
Implement justice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yes, it’s hard. But the alternative isn’t looking good. And we know how
to do this. We have negotiated countless peace treaties. We have found
solutions to thorny issues all over the world. This is not an impossible
task.

for embedded systems: current state, challenges and open problems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Embedded software is used in safety-critical systems such as medical
devices and autonomous vehicles, where software defects, including
security vulnerabilities, have severe consequences. Most embedded
codebases are developed in unsafe languages, specifically C/C++, and are
riddled with memory safety vulnerabilities. To prevent such
vulnerabilities, RUST, a performant memory-safe systems language,
provides an optimal choice for developing embedded software. RUST
interoperability enables developing RUST applications on top of existing
C codebases. Despite this, even the most resourceful organizations
continue to develop embedded software in C/C++. This paper performs the
first systematic study to holistically understand the current state and
challenges of using RUST for embedded systems. Our study is organized
across three research questions. We collected a dataset of 2,836 RUST
embedded software spanning various categories and 5 Static Application
Security Testing ( SAST) tools. We performed a systematic analysis of
our dataset and surveys with 225 developers to investigate our research
questions. We found that existing RUST software support is inadequate,
SAST tools cannot handle certain features of RUST embedded software,
resulting in failures, and the prevalence of advanced types in existing
RUST software makes it challenging to engineer interoperable code. In
addition, we found various challenges faced by developers in using RUST
for embedded systems development. ↫ Ayushi Sharma, Shashank Sharma,

<p>A few months ago I introduced you to one of the more notable Apple
pre-production units in my collection, a late prototype Macintosh
Portable. But it turns out it’s not merely notable for what it is than
what it has on it: a beta version of System 6.0.6 (the doomed release
that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales databases, two online
services — the maligned Mac Prodigy client, along with classic AppleLink
as used by Apple staff — and two presentations, one on Apple’s current
Macintosh line and one on the upcoming System 7. Now that I’ve got the
infamous Conner hard drive it came with safely copied over, it’s time to
explore its contents some more. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research I
wonder just how rare it is to find old internal presentations from a

often, so it’s great to see this archived and documented.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Kevin Wells has released an update to TrainTimes, his application for
looking up train timetable and related information. Version 2.04 of the
software adds the ability to call up the stations run by particular
operators, and from the results of that it’s possible to view timetables
for the stations, as well as the National Rail and Wikipedia pages. A
bug has also been fixed whereby if the ‘future’ button was clicked in
February in a leap year, the program would crash. To use TrainTimes,
you’ll also need Wget installed, and…</p>

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-accessibility-in-the-small-web">IndieWeb
Carnival: Accessibility in the Small Web</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is my entry for
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">this
month’s IndieWeb Carnival</a> hosted by
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com">Orchids</a> on the topic of
Accessibility in the Small Web
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I started making websites back in 2010. That’s 14 years. I entered the
web dev world back when the frontend scene was starting to become
exciting thanks to CSS3 and HTML5. Shadows, rounded corners, custom
typefaces! Everything was exciting. Also, new tags! I remember spending
time reading about <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and all the
new things at my disposal. But I never thought about spending time
learning about what all this meant in terms of accessibility.
</p>
<p>
I worked solo my entire career. I still do. I have to wear a thousand
different hats on a daily basis and keeping up with the web as a whole
is a full-time job. And it’s only recently that I started to realize how
much I neglected accessibility when it comes to my sites.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, I still try to follow at least some best practices:
I try to pick combinations of colors that have enough contrast, and I
try to structure my documents in a way that makes sense for screen
readers but I’m painfully aware how much my knowledge on the topic is
lacking.
</p>
<p>
These days I find myself hating on the “modern web”. I can’t stand sites
that don’t load if I block some JS. I can’t stand sits that highjack my
scroll. I hate that everything is getting more and more performative and
less functional.
</p>
<p>
And in my retreat towards a simpler and more streamlined web, I’m
rediscovering the pleasure of making sites that are simple and more
accessible.
</p>
<p>
Accessibility becomes easier when sites are simpler. Still, I think I
can and should do better which is why I have my eyes set on
<a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com">Sara Soueidan</a>’s
<a href="https://practical-accessibility.today">Practical
Accessibility</a> course (only waiting to have 400$ to invest).
</p>
<p>
It’s a shame that so much of the web has become an unusable mess. At the
same time though, it’s refreshing to see that a good chunk of the small
web seems to be heading in the right direction: simpler websites, less
complicated and more focused layouts.

<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
For a while now, I’ve been enamoured with a certain style of ear
jewellery demonstrated here by Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor:

<p>
Basically, jewellery that spans the whole height of the ear! I love it.
I never looked into it too seriously for myself, because I presumed
jewellery like this required multiple piercings, and currently I have
<em>zero</em> piercings (not out of any opposition to them, I’ve just
never gone out of my way to do the research that’d be required to get
any). However, yesterday I decided to finally look it up.
</p>
<p>
I discovered that this whole-ear-spanning jewellery is a variety of
<b>ear cuff</b>, and that actually, ear cuffs don’t necessarily require
any piercings at all! (Although Jodie Whittaker’s specific ear cuff
<em>does</em> require a piercing through the earlobe.) The idea is that
they sit tight around the ear, being shaped to closely hug the contours.
They could hardly be more perfect for me!
</p>
<p>

<p>
(Note: this post is not an ad; having not even ordered anything yet, I
can’t even really vouch for this seller at all. This is just a post of
enthusiasm for ear jewellery.) Basically, I think this style would suit
me well because, as you can see from my photo on
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/">this site’s front page</a>, I tend
to tuck the hair on the left side of my head behind my ear at all times
(somewhat like Jodie Whittaker does as the Doctor, in fact). I’ve always
been a bit self-conscious about this habit because the ear is a bit
flattened compared to a “normal ear”, and when I was a little kid my mum
used to chastise me for “exposing” it to people, as if my very ear were
obscene or something. I was <em>certainly</em> never allowed to get my
ears pierced, because that would only “draw attention to [my]
deformity”. I mean, I thought she was full of shit even at the time, but
after getting scolded so much I can’t help but be hyperaware of it,
either. As an adult, of course, I feel she had completely the wrong end
of it. For a start, you shouldn’t feel ashamed of your natural body in
the first place. But secondly, if you really want to do something, the
way to go is <strong>attention-grabbing accessories</strong>, so what
sticks in people’s mind is how <em>cool</em> your sense of style is. No
one’s going to give a fuck about a mildly flattened ear when there’s an
awesome ear cuff wrapped around it. Nobody.
</p>
<p>
Given the tightness of our budget lately, it’s hard not to feel a little
guilty about spending on something inessential like jewellery… but
Vivian doesn’t share the same reservations about spending, and it’s
unfair if I’m the <em>only</em> one making sacrifices. I still want to
mull it over a bit – narrow it down to <em>one</em> design to buy
initially, and see how it goes – but overall I think these look cool. I
want them!

EXISTS subquery is currently allowed only directly under WHERE clause or
in AND expression that is directly under WHERE. However, the check was
insufficient previously so that views using expressions other than AND
containing an EXISTS subquery could be created without an error and it
caused incorrect maintenance results.

About pg_ivm
</h3>
<p>
pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance
(IVM) feature.
</p>
<p>
Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views
up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on
views rather than recomputing. pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate
maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately after a
base table is modified.

up-to-date Chromium for Windows XP, Vista, and 7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Modern browsers don’t really support older versions of Windows
anymore, so anyone running Windows XP, 2003, Vista, and even Windows 7
and 8 are losing access to secure and capable browsers. While running
those older versions of Windows on production machines isn’t exactly
advised, they’re still great fun as retrocomputing platforms and to keep
older Windows games accessible using period-correct hardware. As such,
there’s some awesome news: there is now a fully up-to-date variant of
Chromium for these older versions of Windows called Supermium. It tracks
current Chromium, supports extensions, sandboxing, Aero Glass, Google
Sync, and even Widevine on Windows 7 and higher. Micheal MJD just
published a video showing Supermium in action in case you’re curious.
You’ll need at least Windows XP SP3 and an Intel Pentium 4 with SSE2 in
order to run it, and Windows 2000 support is in the works, too.</p>

<p>Redox has published the summary of development covering February, and
there’s quite a few interesting leaps forward this month. First and
foremost, the operating system got a major file read/write speed boost
by implementing records in RedoxFS. The migration to UNIX-format paths
is ongoing, Boxedwine is currently being ported, and more and more
programs are getting ported, including complex applications like
Audacity, Celestia, KiCad and Neothesia. There’s a lot more this month,

<p>Agony first. The agony starts with the fact that Elon Musk has a

since he gave them his money, his time and his reputation. Here’s what
they told that State of the California in 2015: THIRD: This Corporation

the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding

<h2 id="biden-is-a-fine-president">Biden <i>is</i> a fine president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and
proto-blogger
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c">Jeff
Jarvis</a>, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just
made it a blog post.
</p>
<p>
The thing about Gaza is that there’s the rest of the world, and they’re
watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been
such an asshole to the US. He’s a freaking MAGA.
</p>
<p>
So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but
he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all
around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will
die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure.
The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the
right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there’s another path,
compassion and help.
</p>
<p>
Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But
they’re doing it the only way we can, given who we are.
</p>
<p>
Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we
never have. Journos seem to think Americans can’t understand the basics
of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of
the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn’t really any more
complicated.

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-roundup">IndieWeb Carnival: Roundup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
February has come to an end and with it also ended my experience hosting
the 9th edition of the IndieWeb Carnival. To be honest with you, I
didn’t know what to expect going into this. Foreverliketh.is—who was the
host for the month of January—emailed me one day asking me if I wanted
to host one of the upcoming months because the carnival was running
short on hosts and I obviously accepted.
</p>
<p>
His month on the topic of
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive
Internalization </a> saw
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">13
people contributing</a> and so I said to myself “If 10 to 15 people
decide to participate in February I’ll consider that a win”.
</p>
<p>
Well, looks like we got there. I have 44 links in front of me so this is
going to be quite the roundup but before we jump into that let me first
say thank you to all the people who decided to take the time to
participate. You’re all a bunch of awesome people. Also, the Carnival
continues and this month’s topic is going to be
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">Accessibility
in the Small Web</a>. Look forward to reading your posts there. Now it’s
time to dive into the submissions.
</p>
<h2>
Quick overview
</h2>
<p>
As I said before, I have 44 links in front of me. One person contributed
2 posts, 43 of those posts were written specifically for this month’s
carnival and 1 was submitted not by its author but by someone else. They
thought it was a quality entry and they were right so I decided to
include it.

The roundup

<p>
It’s 7.42 am, I have my cup of tea in front of me, and it’s time to
review all these entries.

On Digital Relationships: Once Upon A Time, I Was A Voxer

<p>
There’s no way for me to write up my time as a Voxer both online and off
in any way that’s comprehensive or even likely especially coherent.
Between the memory deficiencies and the flood of alcohol with occasional
marijuana digressions, there’s just not enough to form a full picture.
While I appear on the incest map, there are versions that link me to
people with whom I did not have a saliva or semen connection. The
community was a jumbled mess but there’s also a lot of myth wrapped up
in it all. I won’t deny I at least had more than my fair share of
crushes, including a photographer who I didn’t actually know very well,
although we got along fine, and whose later and far too soon funeral to
this day I regret missing. (People still remember you, K.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love that this was the first post I received. I am a sucker for
stories. I just love them. I love learning about people’s previous
lives, about their adventures, about the way they got where they are
now. I also love when the physical and the digital intersect and
learning about the origin of the name Bix was such a treat.

<p>
Understanding that the generalisability of any study can be questioned,
it is worth reflecting that the IndieWeb—made up in large part of
text-heavy websites—can help foster meaningful digital relationships,
strengthen social support and feelings of satisfaction associated with
these relationships. And because a key, if indirect, result of the
IndieWeb movement is to promote a balance of creation and consumption,
it is all the more powerful a tool to employ in strengthening digital
relationships of humans through the web.
</p>

<p>
VH post was the starting point for so many interesting deep dives and
I’m going to write at least a few posts thanks to this. I loved the
parallelism between the IndieWeb and the physical interactions.

Digital Relationships
</h3>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a struggle to slow the cadence of the web and our daily social
interactions; to avoid becoming over-stimulated the second we wake up in
the morning. And it’s for this reason I find myself gravitating towards
natural activities of the past—without a screen. Albeit with a slightly
different landscape and a more focused mindset.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is something I’m also experiencing. And it’s paradoxical in a way.
I retreated from social media years ago to hide in my digital corner and
do my own things. I spend more time outside, walking, enjoying nature,
and listening to birds. And yet what’s left of my online life is a lot
more meaningful.

<blockquote>
<p>
How a family sits around a table in public all staring at their phones
carrying on relationships digitally with everyone other than those
sitting in close physical proximity is a tip of the societal scale that
disturbs me. How others begin, navigate and end romantic relationships
exclusively with digital mechanics confuses me. The fact that our world
seems to be trending toward more technology that replaces the
relationship with more digital depresses me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The large-scale implications of technology are something that worries me
a lot. It’s one of those topics I find myself returning over and over
again. Another topic I need to explore more on this site.

And people are trying to solve this for themselves. Which is why there
are so many different online spaces and different ways of communication
online. But that also means, that there is no way to have one way to
communicate with everybody.

</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t help to ask myself if that’s necessarily a bad thing. Do we
actually need a way to communicate with everybody? Maybe we want some
friction in the system. Maybe the fact that not everyone is willing to
use emails is why emails are still the best way to have one-to-one
interactions online.

<blockquote>
<p>
It’s not bad to know many people. The value of a substantial social
network is quite high. But having just one close person to go to when
you’re feeling down… how many average relationships is that worth? Who
feels deep happiness for you when something good happens in your life?
Who can you make beautiful memories with?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t agree more. Like everything in life, what matters is to find
a good balance. You want plenty of interactions to keep your mind
stimulated and your points of view challenged and the digital world is
perfect for that. But you also want at least a couple of close IRL
relationships.

we use to communicate, as long as we have the will. Because whatever app
we use, a friend will be on the other side. We can enjoy whatever
platform we have while it exists, and we can move on when it ceases to
exist. It doesn’t matter if the platform stays or not, what matters is
that friends will be there, friends will stay.

Some people think it is impossible to have meaningful exchanges /

is even sometime better to talk to people you don’t see, some topics are
easier that way. Yes written communication are more complex because some
information can not be shared (body language, tone - in particular irony
and sarcasm, …), but that doesn’t prevent people to find a way to
interact that works for them and create true companionship, friendship
or more.

What they said, how they said it and when they said it. All in an effort
to gain more friends. We still called them friends at that point. But
the veil quickly fell away and the term followers eventually took the
place of friends. And rightly so, because you can’t optimise for
friendship.
