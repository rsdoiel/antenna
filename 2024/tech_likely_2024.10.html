<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: mrusme blog</p>
<p>In the world of file synchronization, most people are familiar with
services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. These centralized
cloud solutions are convenient but come with privacy concerns and
potential security risks. What if I told you that to synchronize files
between individual devices, you don’t need <em>the cloud™</em> ?</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: Howard Jacobson blog</p>
<p>He saw her first - no he didn’t: he beheld her first - in the library
of St Ursula’s College, a grammar school in North Manchester which had
agreed to let him research its holdings of once venerated textbooks. Her
head appeared above the stacks like that of a browsing giraffe. She even
swivelled her jaw as though chewing on an acacia leaf. That was a tic he
would come to hate – as for example when it accompanied a confession
that she loved another man, or another woman, or both - but at first it
beguiled him. It suggested the absent-mindedness of a person who was
always somewhere else. She caught his gaze and smiled at him.</p>

<h2 id="guestbooks-are-cool">Guestbooks are cool</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in a previous post, this site now has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook&quot;&gt;guestbook&lt;/a&gt;. But, as someone pointed out, I didn’t explain what the heck a guestbook is. I thought it was pretty self-explanatory but I think it’s worth writing a post about it anyway. On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/guestbook&quot;&gt;IndieWeb website&lt;/a&gt;, guestbooks are defined as:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
a way to allow visitors to your site to leave a comment about the
website as a whole, instead of a comment about a specific post.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think it’s a good definition. Guestbooks are a relic of a different
time, back when the web wasn’t dominated by social media and
interactions among people moved at a different pace. A guestbook is like
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_register">summit
book</a>, in a way. It’s something you can use to leave a trace of your
presence.
</p>
<p>
But what do you write on the guestbook? Whatever you want. You can let
me know how you landed here, you can use it to suggest a topic, or you
can use it to just say hi. Just be kind and respectful.
</p>
<p>
I first toyed with the idea of adding a guestbook almost a year ago,
after stumbling on <a href="https://sarajoy.dev/guestbook/">Sara Joy’s
website</a>. I don’t remember how or why I was there but I loved the
guestbook and it took me almost a year to finally code mine.
</p>
<p>
And I’m happy to see that
<a href="https://kevquirk.com/i-have-a-guestbook">Kev</a> now has one on
his site as well! If you decide to add a guestbook to your site send me
an email, and I’ll be happy to come sign it.

<h2 id="how-to-have-sex-2023">How to Have Sex (2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
Last August, Vivian took me to see the film <cite>How to Have
Sex</cite>, which was screening at the Astor as part of the
<abbr title="Melbourne International Film Festival">MIFF</abbr>. What
Viv did <em>not</em> warn me of adequately before we saw the film was
that it’s about an eighteen-year-old girl who gets much too drunk and
loses her virginity in a sexual encounter that was fundamentally not
consensual but also difficult to describe as “rape”, and as someone who
basically <em>was</em> that eighteen-year-old girl a long time ago I’d
<em>really</em> have appreciated more of a heads-up about that. Watching
the film dredged up a <em>lot</em> of long-buried bitterness in me, and
truth be told, all these months later I still haven’t successfully
buried it again. I have been told, of course, that “burying trauma isn’t
the same as dealing with trauma,” which honestly I would like to call
bullshit on because when my trauma was buried, I felt fine, and now it’s
been resurrected, I don’t, and on the surface that seems to me like a
regression.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
To be fair, I don’t think Viv looked that deeply into the movie; I think
he saw “eighteen-year-olds having sex on holiday” and went, “Sounds
amazing, sign me up.” Anyway, what’s done is done. Apparently, the
film’s just entered general release here

screening. That was really good in and of itself, and I’m glad we stayed
for it. She described her film as (along these lines) “a very personal
story, and one that a lot of people relate to,” and made the excellent
point that our conversations about consent need to be more nuanced,
which I agree with wholeheartedly. She said that “the law, which doesn’t
protect us anyway” has its own legal standard for what sexual assault
is, but it’s such a high bar to clear, and it doesn’t mean that
everything that falls short of that bar is A-OK and acceptable. So, she
said, “since the law doesn’t protect us anyway,” we should move to using
our own definitions and having our own conversations about consent,
which should be human-focused and centre “people just having a good
time”. People shouldn’t just think to themselves, “Is this <em>literally
rape?</em>” but, “How can I make sure this other person has a good
experience?” This is a much more important question.
</p>
<p>
Another thing she talked about is the need to reach out to people (and
<abbr title="Let's Be Real">LBR</abbr>, mostly men) who are currently
engaging in these kinds of coercive, pushy, or not-entirely-consensual
sexual practices, and how you’ll never actually reach them – you’ll
repel them and they won’t listen – if you brand them “rapists” or “evil
scum” or whatever. (Even though, I’ll admit, I’ve succumbed to this
temptation myself.) She talked about a meeting she went to with French
film distributors who were considering screening this film, and said
that one of the men had watched the film and come to the realisation
that: “I am Paddy.” (Paddy being the pushy, manipulative dickhead in the
film. And yes, OF COURSE it would be a Frenchman in her anecdote, of
course.) She said that while on one level it’s obviously shit that he
has been a Paddy, it’s good that he’s been able to come to that
realisation and one can only hope that he won’t be a Paddy in the
future. My experience with my own “Paddy” leads me to believe it’s not
<em>nearly</em> as simple as that, but generally speaking I think it’s
true: there needs to be a “way back” for people who have been
insensitive or, you know, coercive, or sexually cruel, or whatever you
could say. There’s a huge stigma around “being a rapist”, for good
reason obviously and it’s clearly better than society being OK with
rapists, but it’s just so profoundly unhelpful to have this binary where
behaviour is either “rape” <em>or</em> it’s completely fine, or where
men are either “rapists” – forever – <em>or</em> totally innocent. There
has to be a way to say, “What you did was unacceptable, but you can
learn from it; it doesn’t have to define you forever.” Assuming he
actually wants to learn, of course, but convincing such men to want to
learn was one of Manning Walker’s goals with the film.
</p>
<p>
In the critical scene of <cite>How to Have Sex</cite>, the protagonist –
Tara – gets separated from her friends during a night’s partying and
winds up alone on a beach with Paddy, who gets increasingly physical and
pushy before pressuring her to have sex with him. Very drunk, and
vulnerable, she agrees, but her body language makes it clear it’s really
not what she wants. As the ABC article quotes her saying, Manning Walker
finds it interesting the split reactions she gets about what actually
happened in that scene:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Lots of women would come into the room and say ’thank you for making
this film, I’ve been through that, I feel seen’, and a lot of men would
come in quite defensive and say, ‘It’s not an assault because she said
yes’.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I may not have got to tell her so personally, but I absolutely would’ve
been among those women. Because that really is the critical point… in
the moment, she said yes! So did I, to my everlasting shame. I said
more, even, but not because I wanted to. Because I felt trapped, and
scared, and I was always way too much of a people-pleaser. I was so
afraid I’d upset him, because I <em>did</em> really like him, and I
didn’t want to screw my chances for the future when the situation might
actually have felt right. My skin was crawling the entire time, my mind
buzzing with a million and one reasons why I was a fucking idiot to have
even landed myself there. I could never fully, or even mostly, blame
myself – after all, he was the one who stripped me of my clothes without
so much as a word when I was frozen up in panic, and there was a
<em>huge</em> imbalance in power and experience between us that did not
favour me. But of course I blamed myself, in part.
</p>
<p>
So was that rape, or was it not? Believe me, I endured a truly
exhausting number of arguments both ways, to the point that I really
want never to have to try to address that question again. The Q&amp;A
with the filmmaker was really excellent because it gave me the
liberating answer: <em>it doesn’t fucking matter</em>. It doesn’t matter
whether it was <em>technically</em> rape, or whether I
<em>technically</em> consented, or at what exact point of drunkenness
one is <em>technically</em> too drunk to consent, or whether there’s
some kind of sliding scale whereby you can be partially, but not fully,
responsible for “consenting” against your better judgement. Literally
none of the bullshit I had to fight about, over and over again, matters
at all. The only thing that matters is “people having a good time”. And
by that metric, he utterly failed.
</p>
<p>
The problem is, I don’t think we have good language for it, this kind of
callous sexual behaviour that, perhaps, falls short of being rape. The
protagonist of the film is never really able to find the words for what
happens to her; at most, I remember her saying weakly, “It doesn’t
really count though.” I remember trying to use that same line myself,
once, with someone who was trying to “YEAHHH YOU GETTEM GIRL” me just
like Tara’s shitty friend was at that point in the film. But in my case,
I also had other people – <strong>so many
people</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
– arguing with me very sternly that if I was drunk I couldn’t consent
and it was <em>rape</em>, and scolding me if I ever failed to call it
<em>rape</em>, so I did used to call it that, but it always felt
uncomfortably <em>off</em>. I ended up clinging to it anyway, because
what else was I going to call it? It was either that or nothing, and I
was <em>really</em> sure that what happened wasn’t nothing. My “Paddy”
actually became a close friend – not a <em>good</em> friend, but a close
one – but the events of that night were always a sticking point between
us. Interestingly, given the topic, he did actually accept the label
“rapist”, but he also treated it as a bit of joke. I guess he was
defensive; I don’t think he ever truly accepted he’d done anything I
hadn’t wanted that night. I was defensive, too, because I knew that he
had. For all that the word “rape” sat uneasily with me, I used it
because consensual sex isn’t what it felt like either. I clung to it
because it felt like anything else would’ve been letting him off the
hook. If there had been a better word, one that correctly assigned the
blame to him for <em>hurting</em> me without trying to imply consent is
always a black and white yes–no binary, then sure, I’d have preferred to
use that. But that word doesn’t exist. Probably it should.
</p>
<p>
What I really wanted was for him to change. As his friend, I saw all his
good qualities too. I was sure he was capable of doing better, being
better, than he had been with me (…and a bunch of other girls about the
same age, in different ways, but that’s by-the-by). He was a
<em>feminist</em>, he claimed; <em>surely</em> he could come to
understand the complicated interplay between power dynamics and sex! And
so… I really appreciated Manning Walker’s insistence on the same thing,
that men can and must learn to be better, rather than “rapist” becoming
a lifelong label that someone can never, ever grow free from. It’s
something I’ve so rarely heard articulated but it strikes me as
obviously true. I haven’t spoken to my ex-friend in more than a decade
now but I really hope he did, eventually, learn.
</p>
<p>
One last thing I’ll say about this film is that it also depicts that
really obnoxious kind of “British people getting shitfaced at resorts in
southern Europe” subculture, which is definitely not my thing. In fact,
before I realised what the movie was really about, I’d thought I was
going to have to tease Viv for taking me to a movie about the three most
annoying English girls in film history. Basically they arrive in Greece
with two goals: to get wasted and to get laid… and with the life
experience I’ve had, I find it truly gobsmacking that <em>anyone</em>
would still think these are two things that can be combined.
</p>
<p>
I couldn’t quite figure out the position the film took on this. You
might think, given the subject matter, that it came down firmly against
it, but I didn’t feel it did. I felt it kind of implied that it
<em>is</em> possible to have sex (in a healthy, non-abusive way) when
you’re shitfaced, it’s just Paddy didn’t do that, and… that’s not a
message I’m comfortable with. Of course, given my experiences, I gave a
lot of thought back in the day to what it is that <em>makes</em> drunk
sex (potentially) abusive, and the thing I kept coming back to is power.
Two adults who respect each other as equals, and feel comfortable around
each other… it’s unlikely to be abusive in that case. But when you have
a power imbalance – like when one of the parties is a young, frightened,
virgin – it becomes very problematic, very quickly. So… I was very
uncomfortable with the atmosphere of the resort in the film, which is
full of <em>very</em> young adults who seem to have the expectation that
they <em>can</em> get fucked up and <em>also</em> have sex with almost
total strangers… like, of course this is going to end badly, what the
hell! I just think there needs to be a complete division in people’s
minds, where “partying/clubbing” and “hooking up” are completely
unrelated activities. Honestly, there’s basically a zero percent chance
that a drunken hookup with a guy you barely know is going to feel any
good, anyway. I’ll admit it’s easy for me to say now, as an adult very
far removed from that eighteen-year-old girl embarrassed about her
ongoing virginity and insecure about whether anyone would ever find her
attractive (as Tara, in the film, also is, despite her brash exterior).
Even so… caving in to the advances of a pushy drunk guy who doesn’t
really care about you at all is not the way. Which is not to try to
victim-blame… the pushy guys are still, ultimately, the ones with the
responsibility. I just don’t think girls, either, should have this
expectation of getting laid on a holiday where they plan to be drunk
24/7. It’s not worth the risk, man! Save the hookups for when you’re
sober.

<p>Just before the end of 1989, Microsoft made available the first
pre-release version of the long promised 32-bit OS/2 2.0, which was
intended to be the first mass-market 32-bit PC operating system. This
was accompanied by a press release detailing the $2,600 OS/2 2.0
Software Development Kit (SDK). Unfortunately, the December 1989
pre-release of OS/2 2.0 may not have survived to the present day. But in
June 1990, Microsoft shipped the second pre-release of the OS/2 2.0 SDK.
And that version has now turned up, after twenty years of searching, and
nearly a quarter century after its release! ↫ Michal Necasek at OS/2
Museum OS/2 is one of the biggest what-ifs in tech, and the whole origin
story and demise of the platform is worthy of a big budget drama series.
It also happens to be one of my favourite retrocomputing platforms of

<h2 id="googles-changes-to-comply-with-the-dma">Google’s changes to
comply with the DMA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) comes into force this
week for companies who have been designated. Today, we are sharing some
more details about the changes we are making to comply, following
product testing we announced earlier this year. ↫ Oliver Bethell on the
official Google blog This is Google’s overview of the changes it’s
implementing to comply with the DMA, some of which the company already
announced months ago. Google’s changes don’t have as much of a direct,
noticeable impact as some other company’s changes, mostly since a lot of
the more impactful consequences of the DMA, such as allowing sideloading
and alternative application stores, were already allowed on Android.
Other changes, like to Search, will take longer to be noticed. The one
thing that stands out is the tone – compared to Apple’s communication
around the DMA. Whereas Apple sounds like a petulant whiny toddler,
Google sounds constructive, to the point, and, well, like an adult. That
doesn’t mean Google’s post isn’t also full of shit in places, but at
least they’re being grown-ups about it.</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old advice for setting a Raspberry Pi IP address to a static IP on the Pi itself said to edit the &lt;code&gt;/etc/dhcpcd.conf&lt;/code&gt; file, and add it there.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
But on Raspberry Pi OS 12 and later, <code>dhcpcd</code> is no longer
used, everything goes through Network Manager, which is configured via
<code>nmcli</code> or <code>nmtui</code>.
</p>
<p>
So setting a static IP via the command line is a little different.
</p>
<p>
First, get the interface information—you can get a list of all
interfaces with <code>nmcli device status</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>$ nmcli device status

</code></pre>
<p>
In my case, I want to set an IP on <code>eth0</code>, the built-in
Ethernet.
</p>
<p>
I can get all the current information about that port with <code>nmcli
device show eth0</code>, and I can edit the connection using the

<h2 id="adding-systemd-to-postmarketos">Adding systemd to
postmarketOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>You heard it here first folks: systemd is coming to postmarketOS! As
a mobile oriented OS, our main goal has always been to work for
everyone. From technical folks to casual users. postmarketOS should have
all the benefits you expect from a Linux based distribution, such as
being free software, respecting your privacy, getting updates until your
device physically breaks, respecting your attention and not shoving
advertisements in your face. Your phone should be a tool you use, not
the other way around. This is of course not an easy task, one of the
main blockers we found as we collaborate more closely with KDE and GNOME
developers is that they have a hard time with our OpenRC-based stack. In
order to get KDE and GNOME working at all, we use a lot of systemd
polyfills on top of OpenRC. So while we are technically “not using
systemd”, in practice we already do use a large chunk of its components
to get KDE and GNOME running, just different versions of those
components. While we are very grateful for everybody who works on these
polyfills, we must point out that most aren’t a full replacement, and
take additional effort to support and maintain. As much as we might want
to romanticise the idea of spending 6, 12, 24 months attempting to come
up with an even vaguely competitive alternative to systemd, we would
quite simply rather be working on making postmarketOS better. ↫
postmarketOS blog This is the sensible choice to make, and I’m glad they
made it. It makes no sense for a relatively small project that already
has to deal with the difficulties of supporting smartphones to also have
to deal with shoehorning the smartphone variants of GNOME and KDE into
an init system they’re not at all made for.</p>

Campaign Wiki offers a basic wiki for people wanting to keep campaign

What hasn’t been tested is 1. its usability (how well can it be used by
people that are mainly interested in their games and not their software)
and 2. it’s permission setup (the new site no longer allows editing by
strangers: you need an account to edit the site).

Well, as soon as the first person signed up, problems started showing up
in both areas! 😅

<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Every day, people turn to Search to find the best of what the web has
to offer. We’ve long had policies and automated systems to fight against
spammers, and we work to address emerging tactics that look to game our
results with low-quality content. We regularly update those policies and
systems to effectively tackle these trends so we can continue delivering
useful content and connecting people with high-quality websites. Today
we’re announcing key changes we’re making to improve the quality of
Search and the helpfulness of your results. ↫ Elizabeth Tucker on the
official Google blog Low-quality SEO spam has been a problem on Google
for years, but the recent advent of “AI” tools has wreaked absolute
havoc in the search results. It’s a damn blood bath out there. It’s not
up to Google to fix its own mess, so let’s wait and see if these changes
will do anything to reverse the downward spiral Google Search has been
in for years now.</p>

We’ve got the usual updated versions of LLVM, clang, OpenSSH, and so on,
and there’s a number of stability fixes to native and LinuxKPI-based
WiFi drivers. Of course, there’s much more, so head on over to the

How did cells evolve a process to end their own lives? Recent research
suggests that apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, first arose
billions of years ago in bacteria with a primitive sociality.

<h2 id="windows-to-add-gobs-of-ai-to-explorer">Windows to add gobs of
“AI” to Explorer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>According to my sources, AI Explorer is the blockbuster AI experience
that will separate AI PCs from non-AI PCs. It’s described as an
“advanced Copilot” with a built-in history/timeline feature that turns
everything you do on your computer into a searchable moment using
natural language. It works across any app and allows users to search for
previously opened conversations, documents, web pages, and images. For
example, you could type, “Find me that list of restaurants Jenna said
she liked,” and Windows can bring up the exact conversation you were
having when Jenna mentioned those restaurants. Even vague prompts should
work, like “Find me that thing about dinosaurs,” Windows will pull up
every word, phrase, image, and related topic about dinosaurs that you’ve
previously opened on your computer. The AI Explorer app can also
understand context, help jumpstart projects or workflows, and even
suggest tasks based on what’s currently on screen. For example, suppose
you’re looking at an image in an app. In that case, the AI Explorer will
automatically show an “edit image” button that lets you type out your
criteria, such as “remove this image’s background using the Photos app.”

and Crossref renew their partnership to support the least-resourced
journals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Crossref and DOAJ share the aim to encourage the dissemination and use
of scholarly research using online technologies and to work with and
through regional and international networks, partners, and user
communities for the achievement of their aims to build local
institutional capacity and sustainability. Both organisations agreed to
work together in 2021 in a variety of ways, but primarily to ‘encourage
the dissemination and use of scholarly research using online
technologies, and regional and international networks, partners and
communities, helping to build local institutional capacity and
sustainability around the world.’ Some of the fruits of this labour are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
DOAJ added support for Crossref XML to make it easier for publishers to
upload metadata
</li>
<li>
Closer collaboration between customer/member support at both
organisations, making it easier for publishers and journal editors to
navigate both service’s technologies
</li>
<li>
the launch of PLACE: ‘a ‘one-stop shop’ for information to support
publishers in adopting best practices the industry developed’ (together
with other partners)
</li>
<li>
a pilot gap analysis of the journals in DOAJ with the possibility of
helping them start to use and resolve DOIs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The new agreement, signed earlier this month, will slightly shift focus
to build upon existing collaborations, particularly around metadata. One
of the primary sections of the MOU is enhancing support for the
least-resourced journals by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Assigning DOIs and depositing the metadata with Crossref *Finding ways
to improve their DOAJ application experience to help them become indexed
</li>
<li>
Collect and ingest their Crossref metadata into DOAJ
</li>
<li>
Help them to get preserved via JASPER or similar initiatives
</li>
<li>
Help identify other local partners, such as Crossref Sponsoring
Organisations, to support their use of Crossref services
</li>
</ul>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s great that we can further underpin what is already a good working
relationship. Both Crossref and DOAJ are central to discovery so it’s a
natural partnership. Helping journals meet better standards and become
indexed to make them more discoverable on a global scale is at the heart
of our strategy. This agreement opens up a new avenue that allows the
community to really focus on supporting those journals and the research
they publish.’

<p>
‘The collaborations with DOAJ so far only reconfirmed our shared goal to
help make the global scholarly communications system more equitable
wherever we can. Our joint projects aim to seek out and devise support
for resource-constrained journals in multiple ways. DOAJ’s work is
essential in helping journals to develop good practice, while Crossref
offers an open infrastructure to ensure all journals can be included and
discoverable in the global scholarly record.’

<p>I have been a reader of the NYT since I was a small child. I wanted
to be a writer like

I was quoted by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William

<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html">most
successful work</a> of my career with the NYT. I love journalism
<a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">like I love the
Mets</a>. I don’t expect them to do great things every season, but I do
hope for a

or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season">1986</a>
every once in a while. These days I don’t have much hope for the NYT
returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were
that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up
in Queens in the 1960s. We <i>all</i> have to work together to dig out
of the hole we’re in. And that means reporters have to start looking at
themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the
job that we need journalism to do, that it isn’t doing.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
People learn to make art by studying previous artists. Would we want it
any other way?
</p>
<p>
Imagine if everyone had to reinvent everything that anyone had ever
invented just to make something new.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of that in software, people won’t put in an API so you
have to rebuild the whole house just to get a window.
</p>
<p>
We can make progress when people don’t try to lock up their ideas.
</p>
<p>
Individuals live just a short time, we can’t do that much in a lifetime,
but we are an amazing species, because we leave behind what we learn and
we build.

So why shouldn’t our machines be able to learn too? They already can do
things vastly more complex than we can. We’ve invented a huge lever.

<p>
Science fiction tells us that we will lose control and be enslaved by
our machines. I love those stories, like the Matrix and Battlestar
Galactica. But those are stories, they didn’t happen. The future is
rarely so predictable. Things interact in unforseeable ways.

We’re at dead-ends in climate and government. We need to make radical

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, that was a short run. Announced with much fanfare in 2021,
Microsoft has announced it’s already killing Windows Subsystem for
Android, Microsoft’s solution to run Android applications on Windows 11.
Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for Android™️
(WSA). As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all applications
and games dependent on WSA will no longer be supported beginning March
5, 2025. Until then, technical support will remain available to
customers. Customers that have installed the Amazon Appstore or Android
apps prior to March 5, 2024, will continue to have access to those apps
through the deprecation date of March 5, 2025. Please reach out to our
support team for further questions at support.microsoft.com. We are
grateful for the support of our developer community and remain committed
to listening to feedback as we evolve experiences. ↫ Microsoft’s Learn
website Whenever Microsoft offers a way or an API to run and/or develop
applications for Windows, and it isn’t Win32, you can be certain they’re
going to kill it within a few years.</p>

News)</p>
<p>BTW, in case you’re wondering where “still diggin!” came from –
here’s the deal. I have a feeling that when I develop software it’s a
lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using
the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there’s
more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at
first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get
somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It’s like “even worse than it appears.”
Still diggin is meant to say we know it’s really futile, you don’t have
to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we
feel somehow that next time it really will work. It’s a Vonnegut-like or
Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other
words, realistic.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>I owned a C64 and was familiar with the C128, but this one was odd.
It wasn’t running any games, color graphics or playing music. Instead,
it was connected to a monochrome monitor which always displayed either a
weird command line prompt or what seemed to be some boring professional
writing software. I soon came to find that it was running CP/M and
WordStar, one of the first word processors for microcomputers. My daily
obsessive visits to the computer shop led to some friendship with the
owner, to the point that he’d let me in and play with the machines. So,
I played with CP/M and learned how to use WordStar. Well, in case you
didn’t notice, I own a C128DCR now. This blog is about how I got CP/M,
WordStar, and other fun ancient software apps running on it. ↫ Celso
Martinho CP/M, of course, was the primary influence of DOS.</p>

id="facing-reality-whether-its-about-apple-or-the-eu-is-a-core-requirement-for-good-management">Facing
reality, whether it’s about Apple or the EU, is a core requirement for
good management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Baldur Bjarnason has written an excellent piece to explain why,
exactly, companies like Apple seem wholly incapable of working with the
EU, instead of against it. He argues – quite effectively – that Apple,
and US tech punditry in general, simply do not understand the EU, nor
are they willing to spend even 10 minutes to understand it, which is
really all you need. The core premise of the EU, its very primary
function, is to enable and protect the single market. A great example of
this is the ban on roaming charges – mobile phone carriers in EU are not
allowed to charge extra for using mobile voice and data services in
another EU country. From the EU’s perspective, taking action to prevent
private parties from fragmenting and taking private control over the
single market simultaneously grew the economy and increased consumer
surplus. This is the operating theory behind much of the actions the EU
takes regarding market regulation and product standardisation: a single
market built on standards is more profitable for both businesses and
consumers. ↫ Baldur Bjarnason And because Apple and its tech punditry
refuse to try and understand the party they are dealing with, they get
caught looking like childish idiots every time they open their mouths
about it. Normally when the EU regulates a given sector, it does so with
ample lead time and works with industry to make sure that they
understand their obligations. Apple instead thought that the regulatory
contact from the EU during the lead time to the DMA was an opportunity
for it to lecture the EU on its right to exist. Then its executives made
up some fiction in their own minds as to what the regulation meant,
announced their changes, only to discover later that they were full of
bullshit. This was entirely Apple’s own fault. For months, we’ve been
hearing leaks about Apple’s talks with the EU about the Digital Market
Act. Those talks were not negotiations even though Apple seems to have
thought they were. Talks like those are to help companies implement
incoming regulations, with some leeway for interpretation on the EU’s
side to accommodate business interests. Remember what I wrote about
electrical plugs? The EU is pro-business – often criticised for being
essentially a pro-business entity – and not in favour of regulation for
regulation’s sake. If Apple had faced reality and tried to understand
the facts as they are, they would have used the talks to clarify all of
these issues and more well in advance of the DMA taking effect. But they
didn’t because they have caught the tech industry management disease of
demanding that reality bend to their ideas and wishes. ↫ Baldur
Bjarnason What a lot of people – both inside and outside the EU – do not
grasp is that while we all know the EU has shortcomings and issues, in
general, the EU is uncharacteristically (for a government agency)
popular among EU citizens, no matter the country of origin. That’s
because we, as EU citizens, and especially as EU citizens who do
anything international, know just how ridiculously beneficial the EU has
been for trade, business, the economy, travel, and so much more. Apple
can keep acting like a whiny trust fund boy who thinks the world owes
them everything, but they’ll have to deal with the consequences.
Continued violation of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of
revenue. That’s 38 billion dollars. I secretly hope Apple keeps this
childish behaviour up. It’s deeply entertaining.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European organisation for crash testing and car safety, Euro NCAP
has announced that starting in 2026, cars will need physical controls in
their interiors to gain the highest safety ratings. “The overuse of
touchscreens is an industry-wide problem, with almost every
vehicle-maker moving key controls onto central touchscreens, obliging
drivers to take their eyes off the road and raising the risk of
distraction crashes,” said Matthew Avery, Euro NCAP’s director of
strategic development. “New Euro NCAP tests due in 2026 will encourage
manufacturers to use separate, physical controls for basic functions in
an intuitive manner, limiting eyes-off-road time and therefore promoting
safer driving,” he said. ↫ Jonathan M. Gitlin at Ars Technica Excellent
news, and it’s taken regulators and safety organisations way too long to
long to adapt to the growing menace of touch screens in cars.</p>

<h2 id="its-time-to-give-up-on-everything-but-email">It’s Time to Give
Up on Everything but Email</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I was sitting there, minding my own damn business, surfing the web, clicking around, enjoying my time, when I stumbled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/email-nightmare-just-give-up/677615/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, by Ian Bogost on The Atlantic, that is so painfully stupid that I had to take the time and comment on it. Because, as you know, I love emails.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
Finally, in step five, you must evangelize your mission. Email is a
public-health concern. Gently correct your mother when she tries to
correspond. Reprimand your email-happy colleagues. Punish email abuse by
withholding your replies. Or, more gently, darken someone’s doorway. In
short, you must show the sort of leadership that will encourage others
to forsake their email too. We’ll never stop the rain of email, no
matter what we do. But if we work together, maybe we can build a kind of
shelter.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The entire premise of this article is that email is an unmanageable mess
filled with all sorts of garbage and dealing with it is a lost cause.
There’s an analogy in there that is so idiotic that is worth quoting:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alas, there is no opting out from email. As a practical matter, your
inbox cannot be abandoned altogether. The same is true for postal mail:
To function within the normal bounds of contemporary society, you must
be addressable in physical space. You must be able to receive Amex bills
and Amazon baubles, and also, you must subject yourself to lots of junk.
This analogy between your home’s mailbox and your computer’s inbox is so
easily made that it’s often overlooked. Both are stuffed with garbage by
default, but also just a few essential messages.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ian, let me give you some shocking advice: unlike your physical address,
it’s not hard to get an extra email address. Hell, you can get even more
than one. You can go one step further and get a disposable one!
Shocking, I know!
</p>
<p>
In all seriousness, if in 2024 you’re using one single email address for
everything that’s a you problem, not an email problem. Also, Ian, let me
ask you a question: what’s the alternative here? Do we all move to
Slack/Discord/Teams? Do we all move everything to DMs? Do you think
that’s a better solution?
</p>
<p>
There’s a reason why emails are still here. They’re still here because
they work. Is email perfect? No. Is there a better alternative? Also no.

report, taking defensiveness out of it and applying accountability.” A
regular reader of this blog will know how totally I agree with this. But
oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her

typical of reporters, to use an ad hominem to not have to listen to a

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine
</h1>
<p>
If you’re wondering how Israel is going to come back after all this, I
suspect you already forgot how it managed to come back
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict">after
2006</a>. I’m not sure how that makes me feel. On the one hand, I have
completely checked out. The people in charge are utter villains. The
settlements, the cutting down of trees, the terrorizing, the things one
reads in the news if one cares to look are in a vague but emotionally
crushing and morally grinding way similar to how the territory of the US
was built on rape, murder, land grab, death marches and reservations. On
the other hand, I think we cannot let that hold us back from seeking a
better future. We must not stare at the bloody entrails left behind on
this road to war. Yes, the news is grim. We must look past it, however.
What comes after that? Where will we be in forty years? In twenty years?
In five years? In two years? Next year? How will it be better than this?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The disparity in conditions in the north and south is clear evidence
that aid restrictions in the north are costing lives. UNICEF and WFP
malnutrition screenings in the north in January found that nearly 16 per
cent - or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age - are acutely
malnourished. Similar screenings conducted in the south in Rafah, where
aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years
are acutely malnourished.” –

by Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North
Africa</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And if you think a solution is impossible, then take heart. The world
has managed to come back from two World Wars and countless other brutal
wars. Peace is possible. People are not inherently evil. Most people
want peace. Those in power and the people surrounding them and
supporting them often don’t want peace, however. And once the slaughter
starts, it’s hard to stop. Peace is hard.
</p>
<p>
Often the people arguing for war just can’t imagine peace because of
this detail or that detail. And the details are hard to get right, for
sure. But they are not impossible. Imagination is required. How else are
people going to make plans for after the war? The war will end one day.
And those who survived will be following plans that somebody imagined.
It is important to imagine a happy, prosperous future and then to make
plans of how to get there.
</p>
<p>
I remember how I was a German speaking kid in Portugal in the eighties
and sometimes I’d be greeted by an angry “Heil Hitler!” from kids my
age. And Portugal wasn’t even in the war! But all the killing takes
generations to forgive and forget. The longer it takes us to get to
peace, the longer it will take to forgive. And once there is peace, we
must not squander it. We need to work for it. We need to keep aiming for
that happy, prosperous future and stick to plans that go there. Don’t
follow leaders without a clear plan. If they don’t have one, they don’t
care or they’re unwilling to listen. There are many people with plans
for peace. It’s just that the road is hard. And yet, that is the road we
have.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stop the killing.
</li>
<li>
Respect human rights.
</li>
<li>
Implement justice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yes, it’s hard. But the alternative isn’t looking good. And we know how
to do this. We have negotiated countless peace treaties. We have found
solutions to thorny issues all over the world. This is not an impossible
task.

<p>
Since the good guys always win in the end, and are typically
outnumbered, this becomes pretty important. The orcs will brutally,
savagely kill a few dozen elves, and the elves will respond in a very
civilized fashion by wiping out the entire orc civilization. You can
even still see this kind of justification in contemporary colonialism
(<em>cough Israel cough</em>).

for embedded systems: current state, challenges and open problems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Embedded software is used in safety-critical systems such as medical
devices and autonomous vehicles, where software defects, including
security vulnerabilities, have severe consequences. Most embedded
codebases are developed in unsafe languages, specifically C/C++, and are
riddled with memory safety vulnerabilities. To prevent such
vulnerabilities, RUST, a performant memory-safe systems language,
provides an optimal choice for developing embedded software. RUST
interoperability enables developing RUST applications on top of existing
C codebases. Despite this, even the most resourceful organizations
continue to develop embedded software in C/C++. This paper performs the
first systematic study to holistically understand the current state and
challenges of using RUST for embedded systems. Our study is organized
across three research questions. We collected a dataset of 2,836 RUST
embedded software spanning various categories and 5 Static Application
Security Testing ( SAST) tools. We performed a systematic analysis of
our dataset and surveys with 225 developers to investigate our research
questions. We found that existing RUST software support is inadequate,
SAST tools cannot handle certain features of RUST embedded software,
resulting in failures, and the prevalence of advanced types in existing
RUST software makes it challenging to engineer interoperable code. In
addition, we found various challenges faced by developers in using RUST
for embedded systems development. ↫ Ayushi Sharma, Shashank Sharma,

Apple district manager’s Macintosh Portable in 1989-91 (featuring GEIS
AppleLink and a look at System 7.0 alpha)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few months ago I introduced you to one of the more notable Apple
pre-production units in my collection, a late prototype Macintosh
Portable. But it turns out it’s not merely notable for what it is than
what it has on it: a beta version of System 6.0.6 (the doomed release
that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales databases, two online
services — the maligned Mac Prodigy client, along with classic AppleLink
as used by Apple staff — and two presentations, one on Apple’s current
Macintosh line and one on the upcoming System 7. Now that I’ve got the
infamous Conner hard drive it came with safely copied over, it’s time to
explore its contents some more. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research I
wonder just how rare it is to find old internal presentations from a
company like Apple. It seems like something that doesn’t happen very
often, so it’s great to see this archived and documented.</p>

new things at my disposal. But I never thought about spending time
learning about what all this meant in terms of accessibility.
</p>
<p>
I worked solo my entire career. I still do. I have to wear a thousand
different hats on a daily basis and keeping up with the web as a whole
is a full-time job. And it’s only recently that I started to realize how
much I neglected accessibility when it comes to my sites.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, I still try to follow at least some best practices:
I try to pick combinations of colors that have enough contrast, and I
try to structure my documents in a way that makes sense for screen
readers but I’m painfully aware how much my knowledge on the topic is
lacking.
</p>
<p>
These days I find myself hating on the “modern web”. I can’t stand sites
that don’t load if I block some JS. I can’t stand sits that highjack my
scroll. I hate that everything is getting more and more performative and
less functional.
</p>
<p>
And in my retreat towards a simpler and more streamlined web, I’m
rediscovering the pleasure of making sites that are simple and more
accessible.
</p>
<p>
Accessibility becomes easier when sites are simpler. Still, I think I
can and should do better which is why I have my eyes set on
<a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com">Sara Soueidan</a>’s
<a href="https://practical-accessibility.today">Practical
Accessibility</a> course (only waiting to have 400$ to invest).
</p>
<p>
It’s a shame that so much of the web has become an unusable mess. At the
same time though, it’s refreshing to see that a good chunk of the small
web seems to be heading in the right direction: simpler websites, less
complicated and more focused layouts.

<h2 id="ear-cuffs">Ear Cuffs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
For a while now, I’ve been enamoured with a certain style of ear
jewellery demonstrated here by Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor:

The focus of the shot is her earring: there&amp;#39;s an earlobe stud of two hands shaking, and a little silver chain running from that to an ear cuff in the shape of a bunch of stars at the top of her ear.&quot;

<p>
Basically, jewellery that spans the whole height of the ear! I love it.
I never looked into it too seriously for myself, because I presumed
jewellery like this required multiple piercings, and currently I have
<em>zero</em> piercings (not out of any opposition to them, I’ve just
never gone out of my way to do the research that’d be required to get
any). However, yesterday I decided to finally look it up.
</p>
<p>
I discovered that this whole-ear-spanning jewellery is a variety of
<b>ear cuff</b>, and that actually, ear cuffs don’t necessarily require
any piercings at all! (Although Jodie Whittaker’s specific ear cuff
<em>does</em> require a piercing through the earlobe.) The idea is that
they sit tight around the ear, being shaped to closely hug the contours.
They could hardly be more perfect for me!
</p>
<p>
So, I’ve been browsing Etsy and found that

<p>
(Note: this post is not an ad; having not even ordered anything yet, I
can’t even really vouch for this seller at all. This is just a post of
enthusiasm for ear jewellery.) Basically, I think this style would suit
me well because, as you can see from my photo on
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/">this site’s front page</a>, I tend
to tuck the hair on the left side of my head behind my ear at all times
(somewhat like Jodie Whittaker does as the Doctor, in fact). I’ve always
been a bit self-conscious about this habit because the ear is a bit
flattened compared to a “normal ear”, and when I was a little kid my mum
used to chastise me for “exposing” it to people, as if my very ear were
obscene or something. I was <em>certainly</em> never allowed to get my
ears pierced, because that would only “draw attention to [my]
deformity”. I mean, I thought she was full of shit even at the time, but
after getting scolded so much I can’t help but be hyperaware of it,
either. As an adult, of course, I feel she had completely the wrong end
of it. For a start, you shouldn’t feel ashamed of your natural body in
the first place. But secondly, if you really want to do something, the
way to go is <strong>attention-grabbing accessories</strong>, so what
sticks in people’s mind is how <em>cool</em> your sense of style is. No
one’s going to give a fuck about a mildly flattened ear when there’s an
awesome ear cuff wrapped around it. Nobody.
</p>
<p>
Given the tightness of our budget lately, it’s hard not to feel a little
guilty about spending on something inessential like jewellery… but
Vivian doesn’t share the same reservations about spending, and it’s
unfair if I’m the <em>only</em> one making sacrifices. I still want to
mull it over a bit – narrow it down to <em>one</em> design to buy
initially, and see how it goes – but overall I think these look cool. I
want them!

<h2 id="pg_ivm-1.8-released">pg_ivm 1.8 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of
<a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.8">pg_ivm
1.8</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes since the v1.7 release include:
</p>
<h3>
Bug fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Consider tuple duplicity in maintenance of EXISTS views (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, the duplicity of row was not considered and only one tuple
was inserted even when duplicated tuples are generated as a result of
inserting a tuple into a table in an EXISTS subquery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix checking for expressions containing an EXISTS subquery (Takuma
Hoshiai, Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
EXISTS subquery is currently allowed only directly under WHERE clause or
in AND expression that is directly under WHERE. However, the check was
insufficient previously so that views using expressions other than AND
containing an EXISTS subquery could be created without an error and it
caused incorrect maintenance results.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Check if PgIvmImmvRelationId is invalid before open it (Colin Zhao)
</p>
<p>
Fix an error that occurs at dropping tables that occurs when pg_ivm is
installed by shared_preload_libraries without executing CREATE EXTENSION
command.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix an error raised when dropping pg_ivm extension (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, DROP EXTENSION pg_ivm failed due to the failure of opening
the index on the pg_ivm_immv catalog table, because the index had been
already dropped at that time.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
About pg_ivm
</h3>
<p>
pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance
(IVM) feature.
</p>
<p>
Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views
up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on
views rather than recomputing. pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate
maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately after a
base table is modified.

<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Status-Q blog</p>
<p>I’ve wanted an e-bike for ages, ever since I first tried one many,

id="supermium-up-to-date-chromium-for-windows-xp-vista-and-7">Supermium:
up-to-date Chromium for Windows XP, Vista, and 7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Modern browsers don’t really support older versions of Windows
anymore, so anyone running Windows XP, 2003, Vista, and even Windows 7
and 8 are losing access to secure and capable browsers. While running
those older versions of Windows on production machines isn’t exactly
advised, they’re still great fun as retrocomputing platforms and to keep
older Windows games accessible using period-correct hardware. As such,
there’s some awesome news: there is now a fully up-to-date variant of
Chromium for these older versions of Windows called Supermium. It tracks
current Chromium, supports extensions, sandboxing, Aero Glass, Google
Sync, and even Widevine on Windows 7 and higher. Micheal MJD just
published a video showing Supermium in action in case you’re curious.
You’ll need at least Windows XP SP3 and an Intel Pentium 4 with SSE2 in
order to run it, and Windows 2000 support is in the works, too.</p>

performance boost</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Redox has published the summary of development covering February, and
there’s quite a few interesting leaps forward this month. First and
foremost, the operating system got a major file read/write speed boost
by implementing records in RedoxFS. The migration to UNIX-format paths
is ongoing, Boxedwine is currently being ported, and more and more
programs are getting ported, including complex applications like
Audacity, Celestia, KiCad and Neothesia. There’s a lot more this month,
so be sure to read the whole report.</p>

Irony and the Agony of Elon Musk’s Lawsuit against OpenAI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>Agony first. The agony starts with the fact that Elon Musk has a
point; OpenAI, Altman and Brockman <em>have</em> changed their mission
since he gave them his money, his time and his reputation. Here’s what
they told that State of the California in 2015: THIRD: This Corporation
shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable
and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding
provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific
purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research,
development and distribution of technology related to artificial
intelligence. The resulting technology will benefit the public and the
corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit
when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the private gain
of any person.</p>

<h2 id="biden-is-a-fine-president">Biden <i>is</i> a fine president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and
proto-blogger
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c">Jeff
Jarvis</a>, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just
made it a blog post.
</p>
<p>
The thing about Gaza is that there’s the rest of the world, and they’re
watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been
such an asshole to the US. He’s a freaking MAGA.
</p>
<p>
So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but
he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all
around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will
die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure.
The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the
right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there’s another path,
compassion and help.
</p>
<p>
Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But
they’re doing it the only way we can, given who we are.
</p>
<p>
Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we
never have. Journos seem to think Americans can’t understand the basics
of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of
the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn’t really any more
complicated.

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-roundup">IndieWeb Carnival: Roundup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;February has come to an end and with it also ended my experience hosting the 9th edition of the IndieWeb Carnival. To be honest with you, I didn’t know what to expect going into this. Foreverliketh.is—who was the host for the month of January—emailed me one day asking me if I wanted to host one of the upcoming months because the carnival was running short on hosts and I obviously accepted.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
His month on the topic of
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive
Internalization </a> saw
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">13
people contributing</a> and so I said to myself “If 10 to 15 people
decide to participate in February I’ll consider that a win”.
</p>
<p>
Well, looks like we got there. I have 44 links in front of me so this is
going to be quite the roundup but before we jump into that let me first
say thank you to all the people who decided to take the time to
participate. You’re all a bunch of awesome people. Also, the Carnival
continues and this month’s topic is going to be
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">Accessibility
in the Small Web</a>. Look forward to reading your posts there. Now it’s
time to dive into the submissions.
</p>
<h2>
Quick overview
</h2>
<p>
As I said before, I have 44 links in front of me. One person contributed
2 posts, 43 of those posts were written specifically for this month’s
carnival and 1 was submitted not by its author but by someone else. They
thought it was a quality entry and they were right so I decided to
include it.
</p>
<h2>
The roundup
</h2>
<p>
It’s 7.42 am, I have my cup of tea in front of me, and it’s time to
review all these entries.

<h3>
On Digital Relationships: Once Upon A Time, I Was A Voxer
</h3>
<p>

Frankonis</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There’s no way for me to write up my time as a Voxer both online and off
in any way that’s comprehensive or even likely especially coherent.
Between the memory deficiencies and the flood of alcohol with occasional
marijuana digressions, there’s just not enough to form a full picture.
While I appear on the incest map, there are versions that link me to
people with whom I did not have a saliva or semen connection. The
community was a jumbled mess but there’s also a lot of myth wrapped up
in it all. I won’t deny I at least had more than my fair share of
crushes, including a photographer who I didn’t actually know very well,
although we got along fine, and whose later and far too soon funeral to
this day I regret missing. (People still remember you, K.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love that this was the first post I received. I am a sucker for
stories. I just love them. I love learning about people’s previous
lives, about their adventures, about the way they got where they are
now. I also love when the physical and the digital intersect and
learning about the origin of the name Bix was such a treat.

Digital relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://vhbelvadi.com/digital-relationships">Venkatram
Harish Belvadi</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Understanding that the generalisability of any study can be questioned,
it is worth reflecting that the IndieWeb—made up in large part of
text-heavy websites—can help foster meaningful digital relationships,
strengthen social support and feelings of satisfaction associated with
these relationships. And because a key, if indirect, result of the
IndieWeb movement is to promote a balance of creation and consumption,
it is all the more powerful a tool to employ in strengthening digital
relationships of humans through the web.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
VH post was the starting point for so many interesting deep dives and
I’m going to write at least a few posts thanks to this. I loved the
parallelism between the IndieWeb and the physical interactions.

<blockquote>
<p>
Looking back, all this happened in a flash. At the time, it felt like
aeons.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I loved this entry focused on gaming because I personally have so many
great memories that are related to that. The hours spent with three
weirdos—you know who you are—playing co-op games on the PS4 during the
pandemic days will stay with me forever. So many laughs, and so many
great moments.

<h3>
The four phases
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://werd.io/2024/the-four-phases">Ben Werdmuller</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the first era, technology was here to catalogue us.<br /> In the
second, it was here to empower us.<br /> In the third, it was here to
observe us.<br /> In the fourth, it is here to replace us.

</blockquote>
<p>
I’m wondering what the fifth phase is going to look like. This is the
type of post I love to read. Full of interesting information and
thought-provoking.

<h3>
Digital Relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/digital-relationships">Carl
Barenbrug</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a struggle to slow the cadence of the web and our daily social
interactions; to avoid becoming over-stimulated the second we wake up in
the morning. And it’s for this reason I find myself gravitating towards
natural activities of the past—without a screen. Albeit with a slightly
different landscape and a more focused mindset.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is something I’m also experiencing. And it’s paradoxical in a way.
I retreated from social media years ago to hide in my digital corner and
do my own things. I spend more time outside, walking, enjoying nature,
and listening to birds. And yet what’s left of my online life is a lot
more meaningful.
</p>
<h3>
Digital Relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://tangiblelife.net/digital-relationships">Steve
Ledlow</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How a family sits around a table in public all staring at their phones
carrying on relationships digitally with everyone other than those
sitting in close physical proximity is a tip of the societal scale that
disturbs me. How others begin, navigate and end romantic relationships
exclusively with digital mechanics confuses me. The fact that our world
seems to be trending toward more technology that replaces the
relationship with more digital depresses me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The large-scale implications of technology are something that worries me
a lot. It’s one of those topics I find myself returning over and over
again. Another topic I need to explore more on this site.
</p>
<h3>
The Technology Mediated Relationships
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/02/indieweb-carnival-february-2024-the-technology-mediated-relationships/">Sara
Jakša</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And people are trying to solve this for themselves. Which is why there
are so many different online spaces and different ways of communication
online. But that also means, that there is no way to have one way to
communicate with everybody.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t help to ask myself if that’s necessarily a bad thing. Do we
actually need a way to communicate with everybody? Maybe we want some
friction in the system. Maybe the fact that not everyone is willing to
use emails is why emails are still the best way to have one-to-one
interactions online.
</p>
<h3>
Oh the People You’ll Meet: A Visual Timeline of Human Connections
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://andzuck.com/blog/connections-over-time/">Andrew
Zuckerman</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s not bad to know many people. The value of a substantial social
network is quite high. But having just one close person to go to when
you’re feeling down… how many average relationships is that worth? Who
feels deep happiness for you when something good happens in your life?
Who can you make beautiful memories with?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t agree more. Like everything in life, what matters is to find
a good balance. You want plenty of interactions to keep your mind
stimulated and your points of view challenged and the digital world is
perfect for that. But you also want at least a couple of close IRL
relationships.

</blockquote>
<p>
LAN PARTIES! Those were dope. I still remember playing UT99 with a bunch
of people at an improvised LAN party in a garden. And there was pizza.
UT99 and pizza. What more can you ask from life? I should probably look
into setting up a server to play UT99 with people. Could be fun.

<h3>
Digital Relationships Offer Real Hope
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://bjhess.com/posts/digital-relationships-offer-real-hope">Barry
Hess</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I try to imagine what my life would look like if I was stuck with only
the relationships geographically close to me. I have those relationships
as well, and I treasure them, but they simply cannot offer the diversity
of thought, background, and experience that digital relationships allow.
I’m so incredibly thankful to live in an era where I can have the best
of both worlds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The global nature of the web is an underappreciated quality. Like, can
we just stop for a second and appreciate the fact that I’m typing this
while sitting in Italy and you’re reading this somewhere else on the
globe? It’s fucking amazing.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Leaving the corporate web is not enough. Refusing to follow influencers
with their incessant broadcasting of self-promotion is not enough.
Repopulate an RSS reader with brilliant blogs from newfound like-minded
people is not enough. Homepages dressed as business cards are
everywhere, convinced as we are that presenting ourselves as a product
is the only way to go.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/controversial-opinion-two">wrote

The evolution of online BFFs

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some of my good friends I still haven’t met! We only communicate online
in assorted ways. We text, we send each other memes and voice messages
and emails. I count them as some of my very best friends and they have
been there for me in some of my darkest moments.

<p>
This is one of those things that people can’t fully understand until
they try for themselves. It’s incredible how much you can connect with
others via the digital space.

Anonymous, asynchronous friendships

Santala</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Others, I’ve gotten to know in real life. And it’s a wonderful sensation
when you meet someone for the first time in a pub and the usual “getting
to know a stranger” feeling isn’t there at all. We would continue the
discussions we’ve had for years without a hitch.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It really is incredible how normal it feels when you finally meet
someone in person. Probably 2 hours after having met Rob in person we
were wandering the woods chasing howls as if that’s the most normal
thing to do with someone you only just met. But it was perfectly normal
because we were friends. And we still are.

Far but close

<p>
By <a href="https://www.michalzelazny.com/far-but-close/">Michal
Zelazny</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But it all starts on the internet, on the old independent web, where
there’s no algorithm and no digital gods telling us what we can and
can’t see. It all starts there but it all continues somewhere else. It
continues in our hearts. Because it doesn’t matter what channel or app
we use to communicate, as long as we have the will. Because whatever app
we use, a friend will be on the other side. We can enjoy whatever
platform we have while it exists, and we can move on when it ceases to
exist. It doesn’t matter if the platform stays or not, what matters is
that friends will be there, friends will stay.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love this. And I love mail! I keep thinking that maybe I should set up
a PO Box and start connecting at an even slower pace. Maybe after I
moved and I finally have a home I’m gonna do just that.

<p>
Belonging and connecting are battles between in-person and screen time.
I struggle to balance digital and in-person interaction; as I push
myself to live in the present, connecting with someone digitally lets me
sometimes feel I’m not since I’m somewhere else with my mind.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is something we as a society have to confront at some
point. Especially with younger generations growing up so connected. The
struggle is real and it is a struggle. And we have to do something about
it.

</blockquote>
<p>
This is why I try to be as honest with myself as possible on my site. I

Writing As a Relationship

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I believe that co-writing is an excellent practice for long-term
relationship partners. It can keep things fresh and exciting, allowing
you to literally fall in love all over again with someone you’ve been
married to for ten years. More than once I’ve seen something we’re
writing reflect back to me something I’ve been thinking about but not
been able to solve on my own; solving the problem on the page is a
relief.

This was such a fascinating read into something I never even thought it
was a thing that people do. And this is why I love the web. It allows me
to discover all sorts of interesting things.

interesting. What an enjoyable experience this is.

Communicating online and building relationships

<p>
While lots of people seem to be able to build connections through large
chats, for me forums just allowed me think a bit more about what the
person I was talking to actually meant.
</p>

<p>
I still think forums are underappreciated and I also still think I
should set up one at some point. Also, thank you for sharing that
bash.org exchange because it was hilarious.

Digital excuses
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
I’m not going to apologize, though, because this is my indie blog and my
indie post and my indie state of mind. I’m a boomer, but I intend to
take full advantage of the modern whining trend.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You do you sir! Jokes aside, tech is a blessing and a curse. Especially
when it becomes unmanageable. And sometimes I think the only solution to
tech problems is more tech. Which is silly but it’s a silly world the
one we live in.

A Love Letter to my Laptop
</h3>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As I’m writing this, I can’t help but think maybe this relationship is
strange. Maybe I have too much dependence on my devices and that I
shouldn’t rely on technology so much. I shouldn’t be so materialistic or
be so attached. But when you spend that much time during some of your
most profound years with any one thing, living or otherwise, it is bound
to become sentimental.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s odd how we can feel an attachment to objects but it’s something I
can absolutely relate to. I don’t own many things but there are a bunch
I care about and I’d feel really sad if I were to lose them. Also, this
post made me want to go back to working on a laptop, something I’m
missing these days.

Digital tools may create life long relationships

<blockquote>
<p>
I think people are keen on comparing digital relations to physical
relations, but I don’t think they are easily comparable. They are the
same, but different.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think sometimes we lack words to describe these things. I keep saying
things like “Digital” or “IRL” but those don’t fully capture the spirit
of the things I’m trying to communicate. We need a better vocabulary for
the digital world.

<h3>
Digital Relationships; or, How I Met My Wife and Why I Might Not Try
That Again
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/digital-relationships-february-2024/index.html">Matthew
Graybosch</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am careful to remember that you too are just a voice in the dark. We
have never spoken. We have never shared a meal together. We have never
shaken hands or embraced. We have never stood side by side against a
common enemy with our actual and only lives at stake. As tempting as it
is to forget the body when online, we are not daemons or spirits without
bodies. We are human beings, embodied and earthbound, and any bonds we
forge should take that into account.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love Matthew’s post. As I said to him, his story reminds me of mine in
a way. Again, maybe I’ll write about it one day.

<h3>
Digital relationships with our past
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://www.archaeoramblings.com/blog/digital-relationships-with-our-past/">Andrea
Titolo</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The unguided nature of the app allows people to reflect on these
experiences, instead of providing them with a ready-made interpretation
or a written text to read or skip. Left alone, immersed in these
soundscapes, we are forced to reflect on our emotions triggered by sound
and visual elements, thus building a unique relationship with the past
and with the archaeological site.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I very much enjoyed this entry because it tackles a completely different
type of digital relationship, one I never spent time thinking about. I’m
now so intrigued by the concept of digital archeology.

<h3>
On digital relationship
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://bacardi55.io/2024/02/26/on-digital-relationship-feb-2024-indieweb-carnival/">Bacardi55</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some people think it is impossible to have meaningful exchanges /
relationships with other without seeing each other, but I disagree. It
is even sometime better to talk to people you don’t see, some topics are
easier that way. Yes written communication are more complex because some
information can not be shared (body language, tone - in particular irony
and sarcasm, …), but that doesn’t prevent people to find a way to
interact that works for them and create true companionship, friendship
or more.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think that sometimes not having access to non-verbal communication can
be a good thing. You’re forced to focus on the actual message because
that’s all you have.

Stories of digital relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://42m.me/digital-relationships/">Mick</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And none of this would’ve ever happened, if I hadn’t trusted that the
“virtual” people beyond the screen can be even realer than the “real”
ones.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Trusting the people on the other side of the screen can be challenging.
Because, sadly, the web—and the world in general—is full of dickheads.
But I can tell you from experience that it’s also full of kind people.

<h3>
Digital Relationship Reminiscenc
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://trivial.observer/blog/2024/02/20240227/">Basil</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All good things come to an end. People moved on as the platform
struggled with some technology changes and my online life once again
reverted to the mainstream social networks, meaning news consumption on
Twitter and sharing posts with real world contacts via Facebook and
WhatsApp.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is one of the sad truths about the web in general and why I also
think personal sites are the best way to stay online: platforms come and
go. The only place you can count on still being there in 10 or 15 years
is the one you control.
</p>
<h3>
Digital relationships
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://lars-christian.com/digital-relationships/">Lars-Christian</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The rules of engagement changed. Where our digital playgrounds once were
about hanging out and shooting the shit with friends, they now became
something else. People started optimising. Optimising what? Everything.
What they said, how they said it and when they said it. All in an effort
to gain more friends. We still called them friends at that point. But
the veil quickly fell away and the term followers eventually took the
place of friends. And rightly so, because you can’t optimise for
friendship.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The fact that people managed to build careers out of being active on
social platforms is one of the big tragedies of the modern web.
</p>
<h3>
Websites as a catalyst for personal relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://holzer.online/articles/2024/02/29/index.html">Fabian
Holzer</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the dominating platforms of today, nobody will ever be a citizen, not
even a customer. We’re only good enough to be a user. But outside of the
walled gardens, there are still ample opportunities. We can form
relationships, participate in debate, cultivate a corner of and shape
the digital medium. All these verbs - nota bene - have in common that
they are active.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s why I always encourage people to write publicly but to also email
others and create connections. The open web requires effort but it will
also reward you for doing so.
</p>
<h3>
The Downside of Digital Relationships
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://chavanniclass.wordpress.com/2024/02/28/digital-relationships/">Ratika
Deshpande</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The internet may connect us to the whole world, but I think that the
convenience is making us disconnect from each other in the offline
world.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Digital relationships can be a trap and it’s absolutely vital to have a
good balance. Like almost everything in life, we need balance. And it’s
important to always keep that in mind.

<p>
In the end, that’s the beauty of digital relationships. You can borrow

Crying Out
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://blogelogeluren.netlify.app/posts/crying-out/">Turpelurpeluren</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What I am slowly coming to realize is that there is a mismatch in pace
between my conceptions of real life vs. internet. Everything online
seems to be moving at incredible speeds
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s one of the reasons why spending more and more time cultivating my
online corner. The web is just too vast and moves at such a stupid speed
that you end up always feeling left behind.

<h3>
The Internet’s Tower of Babel
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://niqwithq.com/posts/the-internets-tower-of-babel">Niq
Bernadowitsch</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the early days of the internet, these protocols were established.
Email or the web itself were created upon open protocols for everyone to
make use of. A shared language on the internet was born.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s amazing that the fundamentals of the web are still there, still
allowing us to run our websites and still allowing us to interact via
email.
</p>
<h3>
Software Is Built Online
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://www.ciccarello.me/blog/2024/02/29/software-online/">Anthony
Ciccarello</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What is wild to me, is how many of these projects are managed on a
volunteer basis. While some people are fortunate to be paid to work on
open source software, most projects are primarily one person spending
their free evenings trying to understand the questions people submit and
make the project better for everyone.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s incredible how much of the web is the result of a relatively small
number of people spending their free time working on projects for the
simple fact that they care about this platform.
</p>
<h3>
Virtual Intimacy and Emotional Bonds
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/indieweb-carnival-february-2024-digital-relationships">Pablo
Morales</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Many of us desire a form of intimacy and emotional bond from those
important to us. Oftentimes the only way to get these is through a
virtual medium. We want to foster deep emotional connections with the
absence of physical proximity.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The ability to connect through distance is one of technology’s best
qualities. And it was painfully obvious during the COVID days.
</p>
<h3>
Rebuilding Digital Relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://alabut.com/writing/digitalrelationships/">Al
Abut</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Now, it’s like a good chunk of the world took an intensive course on
online communication in the last 4+ years and decided that well what do
you know? Those geeks were on to something.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Funny how things change. It’s also interesting how remote work can open
the doors to a lot more possibilities in life. You no longer have to
live in the same place—or close—where your workplace is.
</p>
<h3>
Digital Relationships
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://microbyte.neocities.org/posts/digitalrelationships">Microbyte</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
on large social media, everything is drowned out, compacted, an endless
stream, which, even without technical limits causes more compactness,
which causes more abstractions. Meanwhile, forums tend to lend
themselves to more long-form communications. And to compound on that
previous point, on social media a true conversation is nearly
impossible, always getting drowned out.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s why I left social media long ago. I found it more performative
than social.

<h3>
The Neon God
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/the-neon-god/">Foreverliketh.is</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We converse as phantoms, the diluted remnants of intimacy’s essence, and
yet still, somehow, retain the gall to call that a “relationship”.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This was such a wild read but it reminded me the time I decided to watch
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain">Serial
Experiments Lain</a> back in the early 2000s. I Should probably rewatch
that anime.

<p>
This is how I feel about the majority of my online interactions.
Sometimes I wish I was closer to those people but at the same time I’m
glad I have the opportunity to interact with them,

Email Is a Good Fence
</h3>
<p>

<a href="https://www.justuseemail.com/email-is-a-good-fence/">Lawrence</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The fence of email offers the perfect hedge between peace and a nearly
frictionless, noisy, text messaging environment.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This was submitted by Nutchanon Wetchasit and the post was not written
for the Carnival but I loved the fence metaphor and that’s why I decided
to include it. And you also might not be surprised to know that I agree
with the content of the post. Because you all know that I love emails.

<p>The big deal with ChatGPT is that it’s a huge improvement over
search. Instead of hunting for clues to the info you need, you can ask
the question you have and get an answer. It has encyclopedic knowledge
of all the development environments I use. And it knows how to put the
pieces together. I don’t care how it does it, it’s a much higher level
tool than search. Like the difference between a calculator and a
computer.</p>
