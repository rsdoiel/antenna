Self-Destruction May Be Ancient. But Why?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: Quanta Magazine</p>
How did cells evolve a process to end their own lives? Recent research
suggests that apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, first arose
billions of years ago in bacteria with a primitive sociality.

<h2 id="windows-to-add-gobs-of-ai-to-explorer">Windows to add gobs of
“AI” to Explorer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>According to my sources, AI Explorer is the blockbuster AI experience
that will separate AI PCs from non-AI PCs. It’s described as an
“advanced Copilot” with a built-in history/timeline feature that turns
everything you do on your computer into a searchable moment using
natural language. It works across any app and allows users to search for
previously opened conversations, documents, web pages, and images. For
example, you could type, “Find me that list of restaurants Jenna said
she liked,” and Windows can bring up the exact conversation you were
having when Jenna mentioned those restaurants. Even vague prompts should
work, like “Find me that thing about dinosaurs,” Windows will pull up
every word, phrase, image, and related topic about dinosaurs that you’ve
previously opened on your computer. The AI Explorer app can also
understand context, help jumpstart projects or workflows, and even
suggest tasks based on what’s currently on screen. For example, suppose
you’re looking at an image in an app. In that case, the AI Explorer will
automatically show an “edit image” button that lets you type out your
criteria, such as “remove this image’s background using the Photos app.”

Campaign Wiki</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Oddµ beta program for Campaign Wiki
</h1>
<p>
Campaign Wiki offers a basic wiki for people wanting to keep campaign
records for their role-playing games. I’ve been developing a new
software that’s now
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/index">available for beta
testing</a>. That is to say: I think it’s ready. I’ve been using it for
this site for a while, now.
</p>
<p>
What hasn’t been tested is 1. its usability (how well can it be used by
people that are mainly interested in their games and not their software)
and 2. it’s permission setup (the new site no longer allows editing by
strangers: you need an account to edit the site).
</p>
<p>
Well, as soon as the first person signed up, problems started showing up
in both areas! 😅
</p>
<p>
So I’ve been busy fixing bugs and writing documentation.

News)</p>
<p>I have been a reader of the NYT since I was a small child. I wanted
to be a writer like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker">Russell Baker</a>.
I was quoted by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William
Safire</a> in an op-ed. I have done some of the
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html">most
successful work</a> of my career with the NYT. I love journalism
<a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">like I love the
Mets</a>. I don’t expect them to do great things every season, but I do
hope for a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season">1969</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season">1986</a>
every once in a while. These days I don’t have much hope for the NYT
returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were
that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up
in Queens in the 1960s. We <i>all</i> have to work together to dig out
of the hole we’re in. And that means reporters have to start looking at
themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the
job that we need journalism to do, that it isn’t doing.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-learn-to-art">How we learn to art</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
People learn to make art by studying previous artists. Would we want it
any other way?
</p>
<p>
Imagine if everyone had to reinvent everything that anyone had ever
invented just to make something new.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of that in software, people won’t put in an API so you
have to rebuild the whole house just to get a window.
</p>
<p>
We can make progress when people don’t try to lock up their ideas.
</p>
<p>
Individuals live just a short time, we can’t do that much in a lifetime,
but we are an amazing species, because we leave behind what we learn and
we build.

We learn by studying ourselves.
</div>
</p>
<p>
So why shouldn’t our machines be able to learn too? They already can do
things vastly more complex than we can. We’ve invented a huge lever.
</p>
<p>
Science fiction tells us that we will lose control and be enslaved by
our machines. I love those stories, like the Matrix and Battlestar
Galactica. But those are stories, they didn’t happen. The future is
rarely so predictable. Things interact in unforseeable ways.
</p>
<p>
We’re at dead-ends in climate and government. We need to make radical
changes, and a fresh invention as radically progressive as any that has
come before is now in our hands.

Windows Subsystem for Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, that was a short run. Announced with much fanfare in 2021,
Microsoft has announced it’s already killing Windows Subsystem for
Android, Microsoft’s solution to run Android applications on Windows 11.
Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for Android™️
(WSA). As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all applications
and games dependent on WSA will no longer be supported beginning March
5, 2025. Until then, technical support will remain available to
customers. Customers that have installed the Amazon Appstore or Android
apps prior to March 5, 2024, will continue to have access to those apps
through the deprecation date of March 5, 2025. Please reach out to our
support team for further questions at support.microsoft.com. We are
grateful for the support of our developer community and remain committed
to listening to feedback as we evolve experiences. ↫ Microsoft’s Learn
website Whenever Microsoft offers a way or an API to run and/or develop
applications for Windows, and it isn’t Win32, you can be certain they’re
going to kill it within a few years.</p>

<p>BTW, in case you’re wondering where “still diggin!” came from –
here’s the deal. I have a feeling that when I develop software it’s a
lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using
the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there’s
more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at
first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get
somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It’s like “even worse than it appears.”
Still diggin is meant to say we know it’s really futile, you don’t have
to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we
feel somehow that next time it really will work. It’s a Vonnegut-like or
Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other
words, realistic.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>I owned a C64 and was familiar with the C128, but this one was odd.
It wasn’t running any games, color graphics or playing music. Instead,
it was connected to a monochrome monitor which always displayed either a
weird command line prompt or what seemed to be some boring professional
writing software. I soon came to find that it was running CP/M and
WordStar, one of the first word processors for microcomputers. My daily
obsessive visits to the computer shop led to some friendship with the
owner, to the point that he’d let me in and play with the machines. So,
I played with CP/M and learned how to use WordStar. Well, in case you
didn’t notice, I own a C128DCR now. This blog is about how I got CP/M,
WordStar, and other fun ancient software apps running on it. ↫ Celso
Martinho CP/M, of course, was the primary influence of DOS.</p>

id="facing-reality-whether-its-about-apple-or-the-eu-is-a-core-requirement-for-good-management">Facing
reality, whether it’s about Apple or the EU, is a core requirement for
good management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Baldur Bjarnason has written an excellent piece to explain why,
exactly, companies like Apple seem wholly incapable of working with the
EU, instead of against it. He argues – quite effectively – that Apple,
and US tech punditry in general, simply do not understand the EU, nor
are they willing to spend even 10 minutes to understand it, which is
really all you need. The core premise of the EU, its very primary
function, is to enable and protect the single market. A great example of
this is the ban on roaming charges – mobile phone carriers in EU are not
allowed to charge extra for using mobile voice and data services in
another EU country. From the EU’s perspective, taking action to prevent
private parties from fragmenting and taking private control over the
single market simultaneously grew the economy and increased consumer
surplus. This is the operating theory behind much of the actions the EU
takes regarding market regulation and product standardisation: a single
market built on standards is more profitable for both businesses and
consumers. ↫ Baldur Bjarnason And because Apple and its tech punditry
refuse to try and understand the party they are dealing with, they get
caught looking like childish idiots every time they open their mouths
about it. Normally when the EU regulates a given sector, it does so with
ample lead time and works with industry to make sure that they
understand their obligations. Apple instead thought that the regulatory
contact from the EU during the lead time to the DMA was an opportunity
for it to lecture the EU on its right to exist. Then its executives made
up some fiction in their own minds as to what the regulation meant,
announced their changes, only to discover later that they were full of
bullshit. This was entirely Apple’s own fault. For months, we’ve been
hearing leaks about Apple’s talks with the EU about the Digital Market
Act. Those talks were not negotiations even though Apple seems to have
thought they were. Talks like those are to help companies implement
incoming regulations, with some leeway for interpretation on the EU’s
side to accommodate business interests. Remember what I wrote about
electrical plugs? The EU is pro-business – often criticised for being
essentially a pro-business entity – and not in favour of regulation for
regulation’s sake. If Apple had faced reality and tried to understand
the facts as they are, they would have used the talks to clarify all of
these issues and more well in advance of the DMA taking effect. But they
didn’t because they have caught the tech industry management disease of
demanding that reality bend to their ideas and wishes. ↫ Baldur
Bjarnason What a lot of people – both inside and outside the EU – do not
grasp is that while we all know the EU has shortcomings and issues, in
general, the EU is uncharacteristically (for a government agency)
popular among EU citizens, no matter the country of origin. That’s
because we, as EU citizens, and especially as EU citizens who do
anything international, know just how ridiculously beneficial the EU has
been for trade, business, the economy, travel, and so much more. Apple
can keep acting like a whiny trust fund boy who thinks the world owes
them everything, but they’ll have to deal with the consequences.
Continued violation of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of
revenue. That’s 38 billion dollars. I secretly hope Apple keeps this
childish behaviour up. It’s deeply entertaining.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European organisation for crash testing and car safety, Euro NCAP
has announced that starting in 2026, cars will need physical controls in
their interiors to gain the highest safety ratings. “The overuse of
touchscreens is an industry-wide problem, with almost every
vehicle-maker moving key controls onto central touchscreens, obliging
drivers to take their eyes off the road and raising the risk of
distraction crashes,” said Matthew Avery, Euro NCAP’s director of
strategic development. “New Euro NCAP tests due in 2026 will encourage
manufacturers to use separate, physical controls for basic functions in
an intuitive manner, limiting eyes-off-road time and therefore promoting
safer driving,” he said. ↫ Jonathan M. Gitlin at Ars Technica Excellent
news, and it’s taken regulators and safety organisations way too long to
long to adapt to the growing menace of touch screens in cars.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I was sitting there, minding my own damn business, surfing the web, clicking around, enjoying my time, when I stumbled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/email-nightmare-just-give-up/677615/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, by Ian Bogost on The Atlantic, that is so painfully stupid that I had to take the time and comment on it. Because, as you know, I love emails.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
Finally, in step five, you must evangelize your mission. Email is a
public-health concern. Gently correct your mother when she tries to
correspond. Reprimand your email-happy colleagues. Punish email abuse by
withholding your replies. Or, more gently, darken someone’s doorway. In
short, you must show the sort of leadership that will encourage others
to forsake their email too. We’ll never stop the rain of email, no
matter what we do. But if we work together, maybe we can build a kind of
shelter.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The entire premise of this article is that email is an unmanageable mess
filled with all sorts of garbage and dealing with it is a lost cause.
There’s an analogy in there that is so idiotic that is worth quoting:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alas, there is no opting out from email. As a practical matter, your
inbox cannot be abandoned altogether. The same is true for postal mail:
To function within the normal bounds of contemporary society, you must
be addressable in physical space. You must be able to receive Amex bills
and Amazon baubles, and also, you must subject yourself to lots of junk.
This analogy between your home’s mailbox and your computer’s inbox is so
easily made that it’s often overlooked. Both are stuffed with garbage by
default, but also just a few essential messages.

<p>
Ian, let me give you some shocking advice: unlike your physical address,
it’s not hard to get an extra email address. Hell, you can get even more
than one. You can go one step further and get a disposable one!
Shocking, I know!
</p>
<p>
In all seriousness, if in 2024 you’re using one single email address for
everything that’s a you problem, not an email problem. Also, Ian, let me
ask you a question: what’s the alternative here? Do we all move to
Slack/Discord/Teams? Do we all move everything to DMs? Do you think
that’s a better solution?
</p>
<p>
There’s a reason why emails are still here. They’re still here because
they work. Is email perfect? No. Is there a better alternative? Also no.

oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine
</h1>
<p>
If you’re wondering how Israel is going to come back after all this, I
suspect you already forgot how it managed to come back
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict">after
2006</a>. I’m not sure how that makes me feel. On the one hand, I have
completely checked out. The people in charge are utter villains. The
settlements, the cutting down of trees, the terrorizing, the things one
reads in the news if one cares to look are in a vague but emotionally
crushing and morally grinding way similar to how the territory of the US
was built on rape, murder, land grab, death marches and reservations. On
the other hand, I think we cannot let that hold us back from seeking a
better future. We must not stare at the bloody entrails left behind on
this road to war. Yes, the news is grim. We must look past it, however.
What comes after that? Where will we be in forty years? In twenty years?
In five years? In two years? Next year? How will it be better than this?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The disparity in conditions in the north and south is clear evidence
that aid restrictions in the north are costing lives. UNICEF and WFP
malnutrition screenings in the north in January found that nearly 16 per
cent - or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age - are acutely
malnourished. Similar screenings conducted in the south in Rafah, where
aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years
are acutely malnourished.” –

Africa</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And if you think a solution is impossible, then take heart. The world
has managed to come back from two World Wars and countless other brutal
wars. Peace is possible. People are not inherently evil. Most people
want peace. Those in power and the people surrounding them and
supporting them often don’t want peace, however. And once the slaughter
starts, it’s hard to stop. Peace is hard.
</p>
<p>
Often the people arguing for war just can’t imagine peace because of
this detail or that detail. And the details are hard to get right, for
sure. But they are not impossible. Imagination is required. How else are
people going to make plans for after the war? The war will end one day.
And those who survived will be following plans that somebody imagined.
It is important to imagine a happy, prosperous future and then to make
plans of how to get there.
</p>
<p>
I remember how I was a German speaking kid in Portugal in the eighties
and sometimes I’d be greeted by an angry “Heil Hitler!” from kids my
age. And Portugal wasn’t even in the war! But all the killing takes
generations to forgive and forget. The longer it takes us to get to
peace, the longer it will take to forgive. And once there is peace, we
must not squander it. We need to work for it. We need to keep aiming for
that happy, prosperous future and stick to plans that go there. Don’t
follow leaders without a clear plan. If they don’t have one, they don’t
care or they’re unwilling to listen. There are many people with plans
for peace. It’s just that the road is hard. And yet, that is the road we
have.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stop the killing.
</li>
<li>
Respect human rights.
</li>
<li>
Implement justice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yes, it’s hard. But the alternative isn’t looking good. And we know how
to do this. We have negotiated countless peace treaties. We have found
solutions to thorny issues all over the world. This is not an impossible
task.

Since the good guys always win in the end, and are typically
outnumbered, this becomes pretty important. The orcs will brutally,
savagely kill a few dozen elves, and the elves will respond in a very
civilized fashion by wiping out the entire orc civilization. You can
even still see this kind of justification in contemporary colonialism
(<em>cough Israel cough</em>).

for embedded systems: current state, challenges and open problems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Embedded software is used in safety-critical systems such as medical
devices and autonomous vehicles, where software defects, including
security vulnerabilities, have severe consequences. Most embedded
codebases are developed in unsafe languages, specifically C/C++, and are
riddled with memory safety vulnerabilities. To prevent such
vulnerabilities, RUST, a performant memory-safe systems language,
provides an optimal choice for developing embedded software. RUST
interoperability enables developing RUST applications on top of existing
C codebases. Despite this, even the most resourceful organizations
continue to develop embedded software in C/C++. This paper performs the
first systematic study to holistically understand the current state and
challenges of using RUST for embedded systems. Our study is organized
across three research questions. We collected a dataset of 2,836 RUST
embedded software spanning various categories and 5 Static Application
Security Testing ( SAST) tools. We performed a systematic analysis of
our dataset and surveys with 225 developers to investigate our research
questions. We found that existing RUST software support is inadequate,
SAST tools cannot handle certain features of RUST embedded software,
resulting in failures, and the prevalence of advanced types in existing
RUST software makes it challenging to engineer interoperable code. In
addition, we found various challenges faced by developers in using RUST
for embedded systems development. ↫ Ayushi Sharma, Shashank Sharma,

Apple district manager’s Macintosh Portable in 1989-91 (featuring GEIS
AppleLink and a look at System 7.0 alpha)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few months ago I introduced you to one of the more notable Apple
pre-production units in my collection, a late prototype Macintosh
Portable. But it turns out it’s not merely notable for what it is than
what it has on it: a beta version of System 6.0.6 (the doomed release
that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales databases, two online
services — the maligned Mac Prodigy client, along with classic AppleLink
as used by Apple staff — and two presentations, one on Apple’s current
Macintosh line and one on the upcoming System 7. Now that I’ve got the
infamous Conner hard drive it came with safely copied over, it’s time to
explore its contents some more. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research I
wonder just how rare it is to find old internal presentations from a
company like Apple. It seems like something that doesn’t happen very
often, so it’s great to see this archived and documented.</p>

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-accessibility-in-the-small-web">IndieWeb
Carnival: Accessibility in the Small Web</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;This is my entry for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/&quot;&gt;this month’s IndieWeb Carnival&lt;/a&gt; hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.basementcommunity.com&quot;&gt;Orchids&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of Accessibility in the Small Web&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>
I started making websites back in 2010. That’s 14 years. I entered the
web dev world back when the frontend scene was starting to become
exciting thanks to CSS3 and HTML5. Shadows, rounded corners, custom
typefaces! Everything was exciting. Also, new tags! I remember spending
time reading about <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and all the
new things at my disposal. But I never thought about spending time
learning about what all this meant in terms of accessibility.
</p>
<p>
I worked solo my entire career. I still do. I have to wear a thousand
different hats on a daily basis and keeping up with the web as a whole
is a full-time job. And it’s only recently that I started to realize how
much I neglected accessibility when it comes to my sites.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, I still try to follow at least some best practices:
I try to pick combinations of colors that have enough contrast, and I
try to structure my documents in a way that makes sense for screen
readers but I’m painfully aware how much my knowledge on the topic is
lacking.
</p>
<p>
These days I find myself hating on the “modern web”. I can’t stand sites
that don’t load if I block some JS. I can’t stand sits that highjack my
scroll. I hate that everything is getting more and more performative and
less functional.
</p>
<p>
And in my retreat towards a simpler and more streamlined web, I’m
rediscovering the pleasure of making sites that are simple and more
accessible.
</p>
<p>
Accessibility becomes easier when sites are simpler. Still, I think I
can and should do better which is why I have my eyes set on
<a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com">Sara Soueidan</a>’s
<a href="https://practical-accessibility.today">Practical
Accessibility</a> course (only waiting to have 400$ to invest).
</p>
<p>
It’s a shame that so much of the web has become an unusable mess. At the
same time though, it’s refreshing to see that a good chunk of the small
web seems to be heading in the right direction: simpler websites, less
complicated and more focused layouts.

Basically, jewellery that spans the whole height of the ear! I love it.
I never looked into it too seriously for myself, because I presumed
jewellery like this required multiple piercings, and currently I have
<em>zero</em> piercings (not out of any opposition to them, I’ve just
never gone out of my way to do the research that’d be required to get
any). However, yesterday I decided to finally look it up.
</p>
<p>
I discovered that this whole-ear-spanning jewellery is a variety of
<b>ear cuff</b>, and that actually, ear cuffs don’t necessarily require
any piercings at all! (Although Jodie Whittaker’s specific ear cuff
<em>does</em> require a piercing through the earlobe.) The idea is that
they sit tight around the ear, being shaped to closely hug the contours.
They could hardly be more perfect for me!

<p>
(Note: this post is not an ad; having not even ordered anything yet, I
can’t even really vouch for this seller at all. This is just a post of
enthusiasm for ear jewellery.) Basically, I think this style would suit
me well because, as you can see from my photo on
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/">this site’s front page</a>, I tend
to tuck the hair on the left side of my head behind my ear at all times
(somewhat like Jodie Whittaker does as the Doctor, in fact). I’ve always
been a bit self-conscious about this habit because the ear is a bit
flattened compared to a “normal ear”, and when I was a little kid my mum
used to chastise me for “exposing” it to people, as if my very ear were
obscene or something. I was <em>certainly</em> never allowed to get my
ears pierced, because that would only “draw attention to [my]
deformity”. I mean, I thought she was full of shit even at the time, but
after getting scolded so much I can’t help but be hyperaware of it,
either. As an adult, of course, I feel she had completely the wrong end
of it. For a start, you shouldn’t feel ashamed of your natural body in
the first place. But secondly, if you really want to do something, the
way to go is <strong>attention-grabbing accessories</strong>, so what
sticks in people’s mind is how <em>cool</em> your sense of style is. No
one’s going to give a fuck about a mildly flattened ear when there’s an
awesome ear cuff wrapped around it. Nobody.
</p>
<p>
Given the tightness of our budget lately, it’s hard not to feel a little
guilty about spending on something inessential like jewellery… but
Vivian doesn’t share the same reservations about spending, and it’s
unfair if I’m the <em>only</em> one making sacrifices. I still want to
mull it over a bit – narrow it down to <em>one</em> design to buy
initially, and see how it goes – but overall I think these look cool. I
want them!

<h2 id="pg_ivm-1.8-released">pg_ivm 1.8 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of
<a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.8">pg_ivm
1.8</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes since the v1.7 release include:
</p>
<h3>
Bug fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Consider tuple duplicity in maintenance of EXISTS views (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, the duplicity of row was not considered and only one tuple
was inserted even when duplicated tuples are generated as a result of
inserting a tuple into a table in an EXISTS subquery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix checking for expressions containing an EXISTS subquery (Takuma
Hoshiai, Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
EXISTS subquery is currently allowed only directly under WHERE clause or
in AND expression that is directly under WHERE. However, the check was
insufficient previously so that views using expressions other than AND
containing an EXISTS subquery could be created without an error and it
caused incorrect maintenance results.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Check if PgIvmImmvRelationId is invalid before open it (Colin Zhao)
</p>
<p>
Fix an error that occurs at dropping tables that occurs when pg_ivm is
installed by shared_preload_libraries without executing CREATE EXTENSION
command.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix an error raised when dropping pg_ivm extension (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, DROP EXTENSION pg_ivm failed due to the failure of opening
the index on the pg_ivm_immv catalog table, because the index had been
already dropped at that time.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
About pg_ivm
</h3>
<p>
pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance
(IVM) feature.
</p>
<p>
Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views
up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on
views rather than recomputing. pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate
maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately after a
base table is modified.

id="supermium-up-to-date-chromium-for-windows-xp-vista-and-7">Supermium:
up-to-date Chromium for Windows XP, Vista, and 7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Modern browsers don’t really support older versions of Windows
anymore, so anyone running Windows XP, 2003, Vista, and even Windows 7
and 8 are losing access to secure and capable browsers. While running
those older versions of Windows on production machines isn’t exactly
advised, they’re still great fun as retrocomputing platforms and to keep
older Windows games accessible using period-correct hardware. As such,
there’s some awesome news: there is now a fully up-to-date variant of
Chromium for these older versions of Windows called Supermium. It tracks
current Chromium, supports extensions, sandboxing, Aero Glass, Google
Sync, and even Widevine on Windows 7 and higher. Micheal MJD just
published a video showing Supermium in action in case you’re curious.
You’ll need at least Windows XP SP3 and an Intel Pentium 4 with SSE2 in
order to run it, and Windows 2000 support is in the works, too.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Redox has published the summary of development covering February, and
there’s quite a few interesting leaps forward this month. First and
foremost, the operating system got a major file read/write speed boost
by implementing records in RedoxFS. The migration to UNIX-format paths
is ongoing, Boxedwine is currently being ported, and more and more
programs are getting ported, including complex applications like
Audacity, Celestia, KiCad and Neothesia. There’s a lot more this month,
so be sure to read the whole report.</p>

Irony and the Agony of Elon Musk’s Lawsuit against OpenAI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>Agony first. The agony starts with the fact that Elon Musk has a
point; OpenAI, Altman and Brockman <em>have</em> changed their mission
since he gave them his money, his time and his reputation. Here’s what
they told that State of the California in 2015: THIRD: This Corporation
shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable
and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding
provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific
purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research,
development and distribution of technology related to artificial
intelligence. The resulting technology will benefit the public and the
corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit
when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the private gain
of any person.</p>

These are all valid concerns and I’ll deal them individually here

<h2 id="biden-is-a-fine-president">Biden <i>is</i> a fine president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and
proto-blogger
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c">Jeff
Jarvis</a>, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just
made it a blog post.
</p>
<p>
The thing about Gaza is that there’s the rest of the world, and they’re
watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been
such an asshole to the US. He’s a freaking MAGA.
</p>
<p>
So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but
he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all
around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will
die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure.
The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the
right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there’s another path,
compassion and help.
</p>
<p>
Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But
they’re doing it the only way we can, given who we are.
</p>
<p>
Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we
never have. Journos seem to think Americans can’t understand the basics
of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of
the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn’t really any more
complicated.

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-roundup">IndieWeb Carnival: Roundup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;February has come to an end and with it also ended my experience hosting the 9th edition of the IndieWeb Carnival. To be honest with you, I didn’t know what to expect going into this. Foreverliketh.is—who was the host for the month of January—emailed me one day asking me if I wanted to host one of the upcoming months because the carnival was running short on hosts and I obviously accepted.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
His month on the topic of
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive
Internalization </a> saw
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">13
people contributing</a> and so I said to myself “If 10 to 15 people
decide to participate in February I’ll consider that a win”.
</p>
<p>
Well, looks like we got there. I have 44 links in front of me so this is
going to be quite the roundup but before we jump into that let me first
say thank you to all the people who decided to take the time to
participate. You’re all a bunch of awesome people. Also, the Carnival
continues and this month’s topic is going to be
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">Accessibility
in the Small Web</a>. Look forward to reading your posts there. Now it’s
time to dive into the submissions.
</p>
<h2>
Quick overview
</h2>
<p>
As I said before, I have 44 links in front of me. One person contributed
2 posts, 43 of those posts were written specifically for this month’s
carnival and 1 was submitted not by its author but by someone else. They
thought it was a quality entry and they were right so I decided to
include it.
</p>
<h2>
The roundup
</h2>
<p>
It’s 7.42 am, I have my cup of tea in front of me, and it’s time to
review all these entries.

<h3>
On Digital Relationships: Once Upon A Time, I Was A Voxer
</h3>

Frankonis</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There’s no way for me to write up my time as a Voxer both online and off
in any way that’s comprehensive or even likely especially coherent.
Between the memory deficiencies and the flood of alcohol with occasional
marijuana digressions, there’s just not enough to form a full picture.
While I appear on the incest map, there are versions that link me to
people with whom I did not have a saliva or semen connection. The
community was a jumbled mess but there’s also a lot of myth wrapped up
in it all. I won’t deny I at least had more than my fair share of
crushes, including a photographer who I didn’t actually know very well,
although we got along fine, and whose later and far too soon funeral to
this day I regret missing. (People still remember you, K.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love that this was the first post I received. I am a sucker for
stories. I just love them. I love learning about people’s previous
lives, about their adventures, about the way they got where they are
now. I also love when the physical and the digital intersect and
learning about the origin of the name Bix was such a treat.

Digital relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://vhbelvadi.com/digital-relationships">Venkatram
Harish Belvadi</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Understanding that the generalisability of any study can be questioned,
it is worth reflecting that the IndieWeb—made up in large part of
text-heavy websites—can help foster meaningful digital relationships,
strengthen social support and feelings of satisfaction associated with
these relationships. And because a key, if indirect, result of the
IndieWeb movement is to promote a balance of creation and consumption,
it is all the more powerful a tool to employ in strengthening digital
relationships of humans through the web.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
VH post was the starting point for so many interesting deep dives and
I’m going to write at least a few posts thanks to this. I loved the
parallelism between the IndieWeb and the physical interactions.

On digital relationships: I miss my gaming buddies

<blockquote>
<p>
Looking back, all this happened in a flash. At the time, it felt like
aeons.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I loved this entry focused on gaming because I personally have so many
great memories that are related to that. The hours spent with three
weirdos—you know who you are—playing co-op games on the PS4 during the
pandemic days will stay with me forever. So many laughs, and so many
great moments.

<h3>
The four phases

<p>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the first era, technology was here to catalogue us.<br /> In the
second, it was here to empower us.<br /> In the third, it was here to
observe us.<br /> In the fourth, it is here to replace us.

</blockquote>
<p>
I’m wondering what the fifth phase is going to look like. This is the
type of post I love to read. Full of interesting information and
thought-provoking.

<h3>
Digital Relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/digital-relationships">Carl
Barenbrug</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a struggle to slow the cadence of the web and our daily social
interactions; to avoid becoming over-stimulated the second we wake up in
the morning. And it’s for this reason I find myself gravitating towards
natural activities of the past—without a screen. Albeit with a slightly
different landscape and a more focused mindset.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is something I’m also experiencing. And it’s paradoxical in a way.
I retreated from social media years ago to hide in my digital corner and
do my own things. I spend more time outside, walking, enjoying nature,
and listening to birds. And yet what’s left of my online life is a lot
more meaningful.
</p>
<h3>
Digital Relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://tangiblelife.net/digital-relationships">Steve
Ledlow</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How a family sits around a table in public all staring at their phones
carrying on relationships digitally with everyone other than those
sitting in close physical proximity is a tip of the societal scale that
disturbs me. How others begin, navigate and end romantic relationships
exclusively with digital mechanics confuses me. The fact that our world
seems to be trending toward more technology that replaces the
relationship with more digital depresses me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The large-scale implications of technology are something that worries me
a lot. It’s one of those topics I find myself returning over and over
again. Another topic I need to explore more on this site.

<h3>
The Technology Mediated Relationships
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/02/indieweb-carnival-february-2024-the-technology-mediated-relationships/">Sara
Jakša</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And people are trying to solve this for themselves. Which is why there
are so many different online spaces and different ways of communication
online. But that also means, that there is no way to have one way to
communicate with everybody.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t help to ask myself if that’s necessarily a bad thing. Do we
actually need a way to communicate with everybody? Maybe we want some
friction in the system. Maybe the fact that not everyone is willing to
use emails is why emails are still the best way to have one-to-one
interactions online.

Oh the People You’ll Meet: A Visual Timeline of Human Connections
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://andzuck.com/blog/connections-over-time/">Andrew
Zuckerman</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s not bad to know many people. The value of a substantial social
network is quite high. But having just one close person to go to when
you’re feeling down… how many average relationships is that worth? Who
feels deep happiness for you when something good happens in your life?
Who can you make beautiful memories with?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t agree more. Like everything in life, what matters is to find
a good balance. You want plenty of interactions to keep your mind
stimulated and your points of view challenged and the digital world is
perfect for that. But you also want at least a couple of close IRL
relationships.

<p>
LAN PARTIES! Those were dope. I still remember playing UT99 with a bunch
of people at an improvised LAN party in a garden. And there was pizza.
UT99 and pizza. What more can you ask from life? I should probably look
into setting up a server to play UT99 with people. Could be fun.

Digital Relationships Offer Real Hope
</h3>

By
<a href="https://bjhess.com/posts/digital-relationships-offer-real-hope">Barry
Hess</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I try to imagine what my life would look like if I was stuck with only
the relationships geographically close to me. I have those relationships
as well, and I treasure them, but they simply cannot offer the diversity
of thought, background, and experience that digital relationships allow.
I’m so incredibly thankful to live in an era where I can have the best
of both worlds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The global nature of the web is an underappreciated quality. Like, can
we just stop for a second and appreciate the fact that I’m typing this
while sitting in Italy and you’re reading this somewhere else on the
globe? It’s fucking amazing.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Leaving the corporate web is not enough. Refusing to follow influencers
with their incessant broadcasting of self-promotion is not enough.
Repopulate an RSS reader with brilliant blogs from newfound like-minded

everywhere, convinced as we are that presenting ourselves as a product
is the only way to go.

<p>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some of my good friends I still haven’t met! We only communicate online

others via the digital space.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Others, I’ve gotten to know in real life. And it’s a wonderful sensation
when you meet someone for the first time in a pub and the usual “getting
to know a stranger” feeling isn’t there at all. We would continue the
discussions we’ve had for years without a hitch.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It really is incredible how normal it feels when you finally meet
someone in person. Probably 2 hours after having met Rob in person we
were wandering the woods chasing howls as if that’s the most normal
thing to do with someone you only just met. But it was perfectly normal
because we were friends. And we still are.

Far but close

<p>
By <a href="https://www.michalzelazny.com/far-but-close/">Michal
Zelazny</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But it all starts on the internet, on the old independent web, where
there’s no algorithm and no digital gods telling us what we can and
can’t see. It all starts there but it all continues somewhere else. It
continues in our hearts. Because it doesn’t matter what channel or app
we use to communicate, as long as we have the will. Because whatever app
we use, a friend will be on the other side. We can enjoy whatever
platform we have while it exists, and we can move on when it ceases to
exist. It doesn’t matter if the platform stays or not, what matters is
that friends will be there, friends will stay.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love this. And I love mail! I keep thinking that maybe I should set up
a PO Box and start connecting at an even slower pace. Maybe after I
moved and I finally have a home I’m gonna do just that.

<p>
Belonging and connecting are battles between in-person and screen time.
I struggle to balance digital and in-person interaction; as I push
myself to live in the present, connecting with someone digitally lets me
sometimes feel I’m not since I’m somewhere else with my mind.
</p>

I think this is something we as a society have to confront at some
point. Especially with younger generations growing up so connected. The
struggle is real and it is a struggle. And we have to do something about
it.

<p>
This is why I try to be as honest with myself as possible on my site. I

Writing As a Relationship

<blockquote>
<p>
I believe that co-writing is an excellent practice for long-term
relationship partners. It can keep things fresh and exciting, allowing
you to literally fall in love all over again with someone you’ve been
married to for ten years. More than once I’ve seen something we’re
writing reflect back to me something I’ve been thinking about but not
been able to solve on my own; solving the problem on the page is a
relief.

<p>
As I’m writing this, I can’t help but think maybe this relationship is
strange. Maybe I have too much dependence on my devices and that I
shouldn’t rely on technology so much. I shouldn’t be so materialistic or
be so attached. But when you spend that much time during some of your
most profound years with any one thing, living or otherwise, it is bound
to become sentimental.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s odd how we can feel an attachment to objects but it’s something I
can absolutely relate to. I don’t own many things but there are a bunch
I care about and I’d feel really sad if I were to lose them. Also, this
post made me want to go back to working on a laptop, something I’m
missing these days.

Digital tools may create life long relationships

<p>
I think people are keen on comparing digital relations to physical
relations, but I don’t think they are easily comparable. They are the
same, but different.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think sometimes we lack words to describe these things. I keep saying
things like “Digital” or “IRL” but those don’t fully capture the spirit
of the things I’m trying to communicate. We need a better vocabulary for
the digital world.

Digital Relationships; or, How I Met My Wife and Why I Might Not Try
That Again

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am careful to remember that you too are just a voice in the dark. We
have never spoken. We have never shared a meal together. We have never
shaken hands or embraced. We have never stood side by side against a
common enemy with our actual and only lives at stake. As tempting as it
is to forget the body when online, we are not daemons or spirits without
bodies. We are human beings, embodied and earthbound, and any bonds we
forge should take that into account.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love Matthew’s post. As I said to him, his story reminds me of mine in
a way. Again, maybe I’ll write about it one day.

<h3>
Digital relationships with our past
</h3>
<p>
By
<a href="https://www.archaeoramblings.com/blog/digital-relationships-with-our-past/">Andrea
Titolo</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The unguided nature of the app allows people to reflect on these
experiences, instead of providing them with a ready-made interpretation
or a written text to read or skip. Left alone, immersed in these
soundscapes, we are forced to reflect on our emotions triggered by sound
and visual elements, thus building a unique relationship with the past
and with the archaeological site.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I very much enjoyed this entry because it tackles a completely different
type of digital relationship, one I never spent time thinking about. I’m
now so intrigued by the concept of digital archeology.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some people think it is impossible to have meaningful exchanges /
relationships with other without seeing each other, but I disagree. It
is even sometime better to talk to people you don’t see, some topics are
easier that way. Yes written communication are more complex because some
information can not be shared (body language, tone - in particular irony
and sarcasm, …), but that doesn’t prevent people to find a way to
interact that works for them and create true companionship, friendship
or more.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think that sometimes not having access to non-verbal communication can
be a good thing. You’re forced to focus on the actual message because
that’s all you have.

Stories of digital relationships

<blockquote>
<p>
And none of this would’ve ever happened, if I hadn’t trusted that the
“virtual” people beyond the screen can be even realer than the “real”
ones.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Trusting the people on the other side of the screen can be challenging.
Because, sadly, the web—and the world in general—is full of dickheads.
But I can tell you from experience that it’s also full of kind people.

Digital Relationship Reminiscenc

<p>
By <a href="https://trivial.observer/blog/2024/02/20240227/">Basil</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All good things come to an end. People moved on as the platform
struggled with some technology changes and my online life once again
reverted to the mainstream social networks, meaning news consumption on
Twitter and sharing posts with real world contacts via Facebook and
WhatsApp.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is one of the sad truths about the web in general and why I also
think personal sites are the best way to stay online: platforms come and
go. The only place you can count on still being there in 10 or 15 years
is the one you control.

Digital relationships

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The rules of engagement changed. Where our digital playgrounds once were
about hanging out and shooting the shit with friends, they now became
something else. People started optimising. Optimising what? Everything.
What they said, how they said it and when they said it. All in an effort
to gain more friends. We still called them friends at that point. But
the veil quickly fell away and the term followers eventually took the
place of friends. And rightly so, because you can’t optimise for
friendship.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The fact that people managed to build careers out of being active on
social platforms is one of the big tragedies of the modern web.
</p>

Websites as a catalyst for personal relationships
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://holzer.online/articles/2024/02/29/index.html">Fabian
Holzer</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the dominating platforms of today, nobody will ever be a citizen, not
even a customer. We’re only good enough to be a user. But outside of the
walled gardens, there are still ample opportunities. We can form
relationships, participate in debate, cultivate a corner of and shape
the digital medium. All these verbs - nota bene - have in common that
they are active.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s why I always encourage people to write publicly but to also email
others and create connections. The open web requires effort but it will
also reward you for doing so.

The Downside of Digital Relationships

<p>
The internet may connect us to the whole world, but I think that the
convenience is making us disconnect from each other in the offline
world.

<p>
Digital relationships can be a trap and it’s absolutely vital to have a
good balance. Like almost everything in life, we need balance. And it’s
important to always keep that in mind.

<p>
That’s one of the reasons why spending more and more time cultivating my
online corner. The web is just too vast and moves at such a stupid speed
that you end up always feeling left behind.

The Internet’s Tower of Babel

<blockquote>
<p>
In the early days of the internet, these protocols were established.
Email or the web itself were created upon open protocols for everyone to
make use of. A shared language on the internet was born.

<p>
It’s amazing that the fundamentals of the web are still there, still
allowing us to run our websites and still allowing us to interact via
email.

Software Is Built Online

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What is wild to me, is how many of these projects are managed on a
volunteer basis. While some people are fortunate to be paid to work on
open source software, most projects are primarily one person spending
their free evenings trying to understand the questions people submit and
make the project better for everyone.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s incredible how much of the web is the result of a relatively small
number of people spending their free time working on projects for the
simple fact that they care about this platform.

Virtual Intimacy and Emotional Bonds

<p>
Many of us desire a form of intimacy and emotional bond from those
important to us. Oftentimes the only way to get these is through a
virtual medium. We want to foster deep emotional connections with the
absence of physical proximity.

<p>
The ability to connect through distance is one of technology’s best
qualities. And it was painfully obvious during the COVID days.

</p>

<p>
Funny how things change. It’s also interesting how remote work can open
the doors to a lot more possibilities in life. You no longer have to
live in the same place—or close—where your workplace is.

Digital Relationships

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
on large social media, everything is drowned out, compacted, an endless
stream, which, even without technical limits causes more compactness,
which causes more abstractions. Meanwhile, forums tend to lend
themselves to more long-form communications. And to compound on that
previous point, on social media a true conversation is nearly
impossible, always getting drowned out.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s why I left social media long ago. I found it more performative
than social.

This was submitted by Nutchanon Wetchasit and the post was not written

<p>The big deal with ChatGPT is that it’s a huge improvement over
search. Instead of hunting for clues to the info you need, you can ask
the question you have and get an answer. It has encyclopedic knowledge
of all the development environments I use. And it knows how to put the
pieces together. I don’t care how it does it, it’s a much higher level
tool than search. Like the difference between a calculator and a
computer.</p>
