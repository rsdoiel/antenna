Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0651 AM CST Tue Feb 06 2024

Valid 061300Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today or tonight.

...Southwest States...
An upper trough off the West Coast will continue eastward over
California today and reach other parts of the Great Basin/Southwest
Deserts and Baja vicinity late tonight. Lapse rates will steepen
across the region today with weak destabilization within the
post-cold frontal regime, and in proximity to the eastward-spreading
mid-level cold core.

Thunderstorms will initially be possible near/off the southern
California early today, and more so focused across the Lower
Colorado River Valley vicinity of southern California and southwest
Arizona by late afternoon and early evening. A few stronger
low-topped storms capable of small hail and/or gusty winds could
materialize, but weak overall buoyancy and weakening effective shear
should limit the potential for organized severe storms.

## SPC Feb 6, 2024 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CST Tue Feb 06 2024

Valid 091200Z - 141200Z

...DISCUSSION...
From Friday/D4 into Saturday/D5, models are in good agreement in
bringing a large, positive-tilt upper trough eastward across the
West and toward the central CONUS, with a persistent southwesterly
flow regime across much of the East. Given this regime, a gradual
increase in moisture and the development of weak instability is
forecast across parts of the Gulf Coast region, with increasing rain
and thunderstorm chances from eastern TX to the Carolinas on
Saturday/D5.

While predictability is low Sunday/D6 and beyond, the aforementioned
upper trough may eventually amplify, and a wave may eventually move
across the Southeast. Instability will be the limiting factor for
severe potential, especially given the possibility of widespread
clouds and rain. However, the area from the northern Gulf Coast to
the southeastern Atlantic Coastal states is an area of interest
going forward. If a trough amplification does not occur, the
prolonged low-level warm advection regime with modest height falls
may only result in marginal severe potential.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM CST Mon Feb 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
An amplified upper-level pattern will persist on Tuesday, as a deep
trough in the West, ridge over the central states, and a deep trough
over the East all move gradually eastward through the day.
Relatively low-topped convection with sporadic lightning flashes
will be possible across parts of the Southwest and southern CA.
While a strong storm or two cannot be ruled out from the lower CO
River Valley into western AZ, weak instability should generally
limit the organized severe-thunderstorm threat. 

Isolated thunderstorms will also be possible near and offshore of
the Florida Atlantic coast, as convection moves south-southwestward
along the western periphery of a deep cyclone centered northeast of
the Bahamas.

## SPC Feb 5, 2024 1630 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

date: 2024-02-05, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1024 AM CST Mon Feb 05 2024

Valid 051630Z - 061200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe weather threat has diminished across Florida, with additional
risk not expected there, or over the remainder of the country.

...Discussion...
A positively tilted upper trough -- extending from near the Pacific
Northwest Coast southwestward across the eastern Pacific -- will
make gradual eastward progress today.  Upstream, ridging will
prevail over the central CONUS.  Still further upstream, two upper
lows will continue to affect the eastern U.S. through the period. 
The first -- lingering over the northwestern Atlantic southeast of
the Canadian Maritimes -- will result in persistence of cyclonic
northwesterly flow aloft across New England.  The second low of
interest is one that has drifted south into the northeastern Gulf of
Mexico.  This low is forecast to take a southeastward and then
eastward turn with time, shifting into Florida late today, and then
across the Peninsula tonight.

At the surface, low pressure over the eastern Gulf is forecast to
redevelop off eastern coast of Florida near the Bahamas by this
evening.  Currently, vigorous convection that was affecting the Keys
and southern portions of the Peninsula has shifted east, with
northerly low-level winds now over southern Florida in the wake of
this convection and the associated outflow boundary.

While weak instability lingers off the western Florida coast at this
time, dewpoints are now in the 50s inland, and thus an accordingly
stable airmass is indicated.  As such, potential for any stronger
convection inland has diminished substantially, and will gradually
end entirely as the surface low redevelops off the eastern coast. 
As such, the MRGL risk is being removed at this time, with severe
storms not expected across Florida, or the rest of the U.S., for the
remainder of the period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0951 AM CST Mon Feb 05 2024

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains valid with no changes. Fire-weather
concerns are low. See the prior discussion.

..Lyons.. 02/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1151 PM CST Sun Feb 04 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will build over the Plains states today between a
mid-level trough ejecting into the Atlantic and a second trough
impinging on the West Coast. Relatively cool temperatures with weak
wind fields should characterize surface conditions across the
Plains, with heavier precipitation falling along the West Coast and
Gulf Coast areas, limiting significant wildfire-spread potential
across much of the CONUS.
