Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0659 AM CST Fri Feb 09 2024

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
ARKLATEX/SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA TO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms may occur from the ArkLaTex region
into portions of the lower Ohio Valley mainly late this afternoon
and tonight.

...ArkLaTex/Southeast Oklahoma to Lower Ohio Valley...
Embedded within broadly cyclonic southwesterly mid/high-level flow,
a shortwave trough over the southern Rockies and south-central High
Plains will continue northeastward as it deamplifies. Generally
neutral height tendencies are expected atop a
northeast/southwest-oriented composite frontal zone extending from
the Midwest southwestward to the ArkLaTex/central Texas. Weak
surface development is possible along portions of the front across
the Ozarks toward the Lower Ohio Valley as the front becomes more
eastward progressive later today and tonight. 

In the absence of any meaningful large-scale features affecting this
region, it appears weak warm advection will be the primary
mechanism, along with boundary-layer heating, for potential
convective development later today. Gradual low-level moistening
should continue across the warm sector through the period, with
lower 60s F surface dewpoints developing a bit farther north prior
to convective initiation. While forcing will remain weak, convective
inhibition should weaken such that surface-based parcels should
become buoyant by around 21-22z across southeast Oklahoma and the
ArkLaTex region. 

Isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop within an air mass
characterized by MLCAPE on the order of 500-700 J/kg. Forecast
soundings exhibit strong deep-layer shear and profiles favor
organized rotation, though low-level flow is not expected to be that
strong due to the weak surface reflection along the advancing front.
A few robust updrafts could evolve along a northeastward-expanding
corridor from southeast Oklahoma/northeast Texas into western
Kentucky/southern Illinois tonight. The most probable severe risk
with this activity should be severe hail, although a few
surface-rooted storms could also materialize and pose a damaging
wind risk this evening.

Valid 090100Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong/severe thunderstorms remain possible this evening
across parts of southeast Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and the
southern Lake Michigan vicinity.

...01z Update...

Strong 500mb speed max is translating northeast across IL toward
northern IN in association with a midlevel short-wave trough that is
currently located over the upper MS Valley. This feature appears to
be influencing strong/severe convection over the upper Midwest,
especially across southern WI/northern IL. Very steep lapse rates
are noted north of the jet, due in large part to very cold 500mb
temperatures, and some boundary-layer heating. While surface dew
points have held in the mid-upper 40s, surface-based parcels have
proven buoyant, and several supercells evolved within the
aforementioned corridor of strong convection. Latest radar data
suggests the strongest convection will soon spread across southern
Lake MI where buoyancy is weaker. This should lead to weaker
updrafts over the next few hours and the prospect for severe should
wane with eastward progression this evening.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-02-08, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CST Thu Feb 08 2024

Valid 101200Z - 161200Z

Early in the extended forecast period, a strong western US trough is
forecast to deepen over the southern Plains before ejecting into the
central and southern US early next week. Strong low pressure is
expected to develop over the southern Rockies and track eastward,
bringing widespread precipitation to the southern and central US.
The exception will be across parts of South TX. Here, dry and breezy
conditions may support some potential for critical fire-weather
conditions through early next week. Otherwise, active mid-level flow
will favor a transition to cooler and wetter conditions through the
remainder of next week. This will limit the risk for critical
fire-weather conditions.

...Southern Plains to south TX...
As low pressure intensifies this weekend, gusty downslope winds are
expected to develop from the southern Plains, toward the Rio Grande
Valley, and eventually Deep South TX. Sheltered from the highest
expected precipitation, and within the dry warm sector, afternoon RH
values below 25% appear likely from D3/Sat through D5/Mon. The
combination of dry downslope and breezy conditions may support
elevated to locally critical fire-weather concerns through the
weekend and into early next week. However, significant uncertainty
remains regarding the availability of dry fuels. Preceding days of
dry and breezy may allow for some curing ahead of the favorable
meteorological conditions. Still, confidence in more widespread
critical fire-weather conditions is too low to introduce
probabilities. Elsewhere, fire-weather concerns appear low through
the remainder of the forecast period as much cooler/wetter
conditions and weaker winds are expected to develop.

Mesoscale Discussion 0112
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1048 AM CST Thu Feb 08 2024

Areas affected...Northern Arizona

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 081648Z - 081945Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snowfall with rates 1-2 inches per hour. Areas of
blowing snow with poor visibility.

DISCUSSION...A cold front currently located across western Arizona
will advance eastward this morning. Ahead of this feature, upslope
snow showers are ongoing with light to moderate snow being reported
in Flagstaff and across the Prescott Valley. Temperatures below 6000
feet are hovering just above freezing just south of the Mogollon
Rim. Ahead of the front, steep low to mid-level lapse rates are in
place around 7-8 C/km. As the front advances eastward, snowfall
rates will increase as frontogenetic forcing increases along with
strong upslope flow along the terrain. Given the lapse rate profile,
some convective enhancement is likely, with heavy snowfall rates
around 1-2 inches per hour at times. Lower elevation locations where
dew points are below 32F may see quick snow levels lower with any
heavier precipitation rates. Given the strong southerly flow gusting
25-30 mph (locally as high as 40 mph), poor visibility is likely,
especially along the cold frontal passage. These conditions will
continue to shift eastward with the cold front, mainly along the
high terrain of the Mogollon Rim, through the afternoon and evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1039 AM CST Thu Feb 08 2024

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...17z Update...
Morning observations show wind gusts of 25-30+ mph and pockets of
lower humidity becoming more numerous across the southern Plains.
Winds should continue to increase through the day as a weak dryline
mixes eastward. Locally elevated to near-critical meteorological
conditions are possible this afternoon over parts of eastern OK/KS
and western MO. However, area fuels remain poorly receptive to fire
starts/spread, suggesting fire-weather concerns will remain
localized. See the previous discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 02/08/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CST Thu Feb 08 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level impulse embedded in a broad upper-level cyclonic flow
regime will impinge on the Plains states today, encouraging surface
low development along the central High Plains. While low-level
moisture will continue to return northward across portions of the
Plains states, downslope westerly flow along the southern High
Plains will support dry and windy surface conditions during the
afternoon. While these conditions may reach elevated-equivalent
thresholds in spots, fuels appear poorly receptive to fire spread,
precluding the introduction of fire weather highlights.

Valid 081630Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM FAR EASTERN
IOWA EASTWARD TO SOUTHWESTERN PARTS OF LAKE MICHIGAN...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong/severe thunderstorms remain possible this afternoon
through early evening across parts of far eastern Iowa, northern
Illinois, far southern Wisconsin, and the southern Lake Michigan
vicinity.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level short-wave trough now crossing the Middle Missouri
Valley/central Plains will continue progressing northeastward today
and tonight, while a second feature now in the vicinity of the Lower
Colorado Valley shifts eastward through the period.  Meanwhile,
upper ridging over the East will be shunted progressively eastward
by the aforementioned advance of short-wave troughs farther west.

At the surface, a rather deep (990 mb) surface cyclone is currently
analyzed near the ND/SD/MN border intersection, with a cold front
extending southward across the Middle Missouri Valley into Kansas. 
This boundary, and the advance of the upper trough, may support
isolated late afternoon strong/potentially severe convective
development across eastern Iowa/northwestern Illinois.

Elsewhere, showers and scattered thunderstorms are expected to
evolve across the Four Corners states ahead of the aforementioned
upper trough, and overnight thunder may evolve within an area of
broad/weak QG ascent over parts of the Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys.  Severe weather is not expected in these areas. 

...Eastern Iowa/northern Illinois/southern Wisconsin vicinity...
Low-level moisture remains a primary uncertainty today, with respect
to potential strong/severe storm development.  Dewpoints remain in
the upper 30s/low 40s across the Iowa/Illinois area, where model
forecast soundings -- particularly the RAP -- have consistently
indicated upper 40s to low 50s dewpoints by late afternoon.  This
degree of moistening still appears to be a bit aggressive, with
middle to upper 40s largely anticipated.  

With that said, very cold air aloft/steep lapse rates will continue
to overspread this region, and the deep-layer wind field is
conditionally quite supportive of severe/supercell storms.  At this
time, we will maintain MRGL risk and all-hazard, low-probability
outlook.  A couple of storms may develop by late afternoon, in the
eastern Iowa/northwestern Illinois vicinity, and then shift
eastward/east-northeastward through early evening, before weakening.

However, evolution of moisture through the day will be closely
watched, as the more aggressive RAP model solution -- should it
appear more likely to occur -- would require consideration for an
upgrade to the outlook at 20Z.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CST Tue Feb 06 2024

Valid 091200Z - 141200Z

...DISCUSSION...
From Friday/D4 into Saturday/D5, models are in good agreement in
bringing a large, positive-tilt upper trough eastward across the
West and toward the central CONUS, with a persistent southwesterly
flow regime across much of the East. Given this regime, a gradual
increase in moisture and the development of weak instability is
forecast across parts of the Gulf Coast region, with increasing rain
and thunderstorm chances from eastern TX to the Carolinas on
Saturday/D5.

While predictability is low Sunday/D6 and beyond, the aforementioned
upper trough may eventually amplify, and a wave may eventually move
across the Southeast. Instability will be the limiting factor for
severe potential, especially given the possibility of widespread
clouds and rain. However, the area from the northern Gulf Coast to
the southeastern Atlantic Coastal states is an area of interest
going forward. If a trough amplification does not occur, the
prolonged low-level warm advection regime with modest height falls
may only result in marginal severe potential.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM CST Mon Feb 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
An amplified upper-level pattern will persist on Tuesday, as a deep
trough in the West, ridge over the central states, and a deep trough
over the East all move gradually eastward through the day.
Relatively low-topped convection with sporadic lightning flashes
will be possible across parts of the Southwest and southern CA.
While a strong storm or two cannot be ruled out from the lower CO
River Valley into western AZ, weak instability should generally
limit the organized severe-thunderstorm threat. 

Isolated thunderstorms will also be possible near and offshore of
the Florida Atlantic coast, as convection moves south-southwestward
along the western periphery of a deep cyclone centered northeast of
the Bahamas.
