## Deep mutational scanning of the RNase III-like domain in Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing protein KREPB4

date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Kinetoplastid pathogens including Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania species, are early diverged, eukaryotic, unicellular parasites. Functional understanding of many proteins from these pathogens has been hampered by limited sequence homology to proteins from other model organisms. Here we describe the development of a high-throughput deep mutational scanning approach in T. brucei that facilitates rapid and unbiased assessment of the impacts of many possible amino acid substitutions within a protein on cell fitness, as measured by relative cell growth. The approach leverages several molecular technologies: cells with conditional expression of a wild-type gene of interest and constitutive expression of a library of mutant variants, degron-controlled stabilization of I-SceI meganuclease to mediate highly efficient transfection of a mutant allele library, and a high-throughput sequencing readout for cell growth upon conditional knockdown of wild-type gene expression and exclusive expression of mutant variants. Using this method, we queried the effects of amino acid substitutions in the apparently non-catalytic RNase III-like domain of KREPB4 (B4), which is an essential component of the RNA Editing Catalytic Complexes (RECCs) that carry out mitochondrial RNA editing in T. brucei. We measured the impacts of thousands of B4 variants on bloodstream form cell growth and validated the most deleterious variants containing single amino acid substitutions. Crucially, there was no correlation between phenotypes and amino acid conservation, demonstrating the greater power of this method over traditional sequence homology searching to identify functional residues. The bloodstream form cell growth phenotypes were combined with structural modeling, RECC protein proximity data, and analysis of selected substitutions in procyclic form T. brucei. These analyses revealed that the B4 RNaseIII-like domain is essential for maintenance of RECC integrity and RECC protein abundances and is also involved in changes in RECCs that occur between bloodstream and procyclic form life cycle stages.

## Research progress on the microbiota in bladder cancer tumors

date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The microbiota, also referred to as the microbial community, is a crucial component of the human microenvironment. It is located predominantly in various organs, including the intestines, skin, oral cavity, respiratory tract, and reproductive tract. The microbiota maintains a symbiotic relationship with the human body, influencing physiological and pathological functions to a significant degree. There is increasing evidence linking the microbial flora to human cancers. In contrast to the traditional belief that the urethra and urine of normal individuals are sterile, recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technology and bacterial cultivation methods have led to the discovery of specific microbial communities in the urethras of healthy individuals. Given the prevalence of bladder cancer (BCa) as a common malignancy of the urinary system, researchers have shifted their focus to exploring the connection between disease development and the unique microbial community within tumors. This shift has led to a deeper investigation into the role of microbiota in the onset, progression, metastasis, prognosis, and potential for early detection of BCa. This article reviews the existing research on the microbiota within BCa tumors and summarizes the findings regarding the roles of different microbes in various aspects of this disease.

## Isolation of mucosa-associated microbiota dysbiosis in the ascending colon in hepatitis C virus post-sustained virologic response cirrhotic patients

date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAchieving sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) reduces all-cause mortality. However, the mechanisms and risk factors for liver fibrosis and portal hypertension post-SVR remain incompletely understood. In the gut-liver axis, mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) substantially influence immune and metabolic functions, displaying spatial heterogeneity at the anatomical intestinal site. We analyzed MAM composition and function to isolate the locoregional MAM involved in chronic liver disease progression in HCV post-SVR patients.MethodsWe collected MAM samples from three intestinal sites (terminal ileum, ascending colon, and sigmoid colon) via brushing during colonoscopy in 23 HCV post-SVR patients and 25 individuals without liver disease (controls). The 16S rRNA of bacterial DNA in specimens collected with a brush and in feces was sequenced. The molecular expression of intestinal tissues and hepatic tissues were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR.ResultsIn the post-SVR group, the microbial Î²-diversity of MAM, especially in the ascending colon, differed from the control group and was associated with liver fibrosis progression. In PICRUSt analysis, MAM in the ascending colon in the liver cirrhosis (LC) group showed compromised functions associated with the intestinal barrier and bile acid production, and FGF19 expression was markedly decreased in the terminal ileum biopsy tissue in the LC group. At the genus level, six short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacterial genera, Blautia, Alistipes, Roseburia, Agathobaculum, Dorea, and Pseudoflavonifractor were reduced in the ascending colon of post-SVR LC patients.ConclusionIn patients of HCV post-SVR, we identified the association between the degree of liver fibrosis and dysbiosis of mucosa-associated SCFA-producing bacterial genera that may be related to intestinal barrier and bile acid production in the ascending colon.
