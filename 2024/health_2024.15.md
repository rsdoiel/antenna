## Human immunodeficiency virus and oral microbiota: mutual influence on the establishment of a viral gingival reservoir in individuals under antiretroviral therapy

date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The role of the oral microbiota in the overall health and in systemic diseases has gained more importance in the recent years, mainly due to the systemic effects that are mediated by the chronic inflammation caused by oral diseases, such as periodontitis, through the microbial communities of the mouth. The chronic infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interacts at the tissue level (e.g. gut, genital tract, brain) to create reservoirs; the modulation of the gut microbiota by HIV infection is a good example of these interactions. The purpose of the present review is to assess the state of knowledge on the oral microbiota (microbiome, mycobiome and virome) of HIV-infected patients in comparison to that of HIV-negative individuals and to discuss the reciprocal influence of HIV infection and oral microbiota in patients with periodontitis on the potential establishment of a viral gingival reservoir. The influence of different clinical and biological parameters are reviewed including age, immune and viral status, potent antiretroviral therapies, smoking, infection of the airway and viral coinfections, all factors that can modulate the oral microbiota during HIV infection. The analysis of the literature proposed in this review indicates that the comparisons of the available studies are difficult due to their great heterogeneity. However, some important findings emerge: (i) the oral microbiota is less influenced than that of the gut during HIV infection, although some recurrent changes in the microbiome are identified in many studies; (ii) severe immunosuppression is correlated with altered microbiota and potent antiretroviral therapies correct partially these modifications; (iii) periodontitis constitutes a major factor of dysbiosis, which is exacerbated in HIV-infected patients; its pathogenesis can be described as a reciprocal reinforcement of the two conditions, where the local dysbiosis present in the periodontal pocket leads to inflammation, bacterial translocation and destruction of the supporting tissues, which in turn enhances an inflammatory environment that perpetuates the periodontitis cycle. With the objective of curing viral reservoirs of HIV-infected patients in the future years, it appears important to develop further researches aimed at defining whether the inflamed gingiva can serve of viral reservoir in HIV-infected patients with periodontitis.

## Oral-to-rectum microbial transmission in orthopedic patients without a history of intestinal disorders

date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The enrichment of oral taxa in the gut has recently been reported as a notable alteration in the microbial balance in patients with intestinal disorders. However, translocation in populations without such diseases remains controversial. In this study, we examined 49 pairs of tongue and rectal samples collected from orthopedic patients without a history of intestinal disorders to verify the presence of oral taxa in the rectal microbiota. The bacterial composition of each sample was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and amplicon sequence variant (ASV) analysis. Although the bacterial compositions of the tongue and rectal microbiota were distinctly different, tongue ASVs were detected in 67.3% of the participants and accounted for 0.0%–9.37% of the rectal microbiota. Particularly, Streptococcus salivarius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus parasanguinis were abundant in the rectal microbiota. According to the network analysis, tongue taxa, such as S. salivarius and S. parasanguinis, formed a cohabiting group with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Alistipes finegoldii in the rectal microbiota. The total abundance of tongue ASVs in the rectal microbiota was significantly higher in participants with older age, hypertension, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. Our study presents an extensive translocation of oral taxa to the rectum of a population without intestinal disorders and suggests that aging, hypertension, and PPI use are associated with an increased abundance of oral taxa and potential pathogenic bacteria in the rectal microbiota.

## Unveiling Cryptosporidium parvum sporozoite-derived extracellular vesicles: profiling, origin, and protein composition

date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of a zoonotic disease and a main cause of diarrhea in newborns. Effective drugs or vaccines are still lacking. Oocyst is the infective form of the parasite; after its ingestion, the oocyst excysts and releases four sporozoites into the host intestine that rapidly attack the enterocytes. The membrane protein CpRom1 is a large rhomboid protease that is expressed by sporozoites and recognized as antigen by the host immune system. In this study, we observed the release of CpRom1 with extracellular vesicles (EVs) that was not previously described. To investigate this phenomenon, we isolated and resolved EVs from the excystation medium by differential ultracentrifugation. Fluorescence flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments identified two types of sporozoite-derived vesicles: large extracellular vesicles (LEVs) and small extracellular vesicles (SEVs). Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) revealed mode diameter of 181 nm for LEVs and 105 nm for SEVs, respectively. Immunodetection experiments proved the presence of CpRom1 and the Golgi protein CpGRASP in LEVs, while immune-electron microscopy trials demonstrated the localization of CpRom1 on the LEVs surface. TEM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that LEVs were generated by means of the budding of the outer membrane of sporozoites; conversely, the origin of SEVs remained uncertain. Distinct protein compositions were observed between LEVs and SEVs as evidenced by their corresponding electrophoretic profiles. Indeed, a dedicated proteomic analysis identified 5 and 16 proteins unique for LEVs and SEVs, respectively. Overall, 60 proteins were identified in the proteome of both types of vesicles and most of these proteins (48 in number) were already identified in the molecular cargo of extracellular vesicles from other organisms. Noteworthy, we identified 12 proteins unique to Cryptosporidium spp. and this last group included the immunodominant parasite antigen glycoprotein GP60, which is one of the most abundant proteins in both LEVs and SEVs.

## Illuminating microflora: shedding light on the potential of blue light to modulate the cutaneous microbiome

date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Cutaneous diseases (such as atopic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, alopecia and chronic wounds) rank as the fourth most prevalent human disease, affecting nearly one-third of the world’s population. Skin diseases contribute to significant non-fatal disability globally, impacting individuals, partners, and society at large. Recent evidence suggests that specific microbes colonising our skin and its appendages are often overrepresented in disease. Therefore, manipulating interactions of the microbiome in a non-invasive and safe way presents an attractive approach for management of skin and hair follicle conditions. Due to its proven anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects, blue light (380 – 495nm) has received considerable attention as a possible ‘magic bullet’ for management of skin dysbiosis. As humans, we have evolved under the influence of sun exposure, which comprise a significant portion of blue light. A growing body of evidence indicates that our resident skin microbiome possesses the ability to detect and respond to blue light through expression of chromophores. This can modulate physiological responses, ranging from cytotoxicity to proliferation. In this review we first present evidence of the diverse blue light-sensitive chromophores expressed by members of the skin microbiome. Subsequently, we discuss how blue light may impact the dialog between the host and its skin microbiome in prevalent skin and hair follicle conditions. Finally, we examine the constraints of this non-invasive treatment strategy and outline prospective avenues for further research. Collectively, these findings present a comprehensive body of evidence regarding the potential utility of blue light as a restorative tool for managing prevalent skin conditions. Furthermore, they underscore the critical unmet need for a whole systems approach to comprehend the ramifications of blue light on both host and microbial behaviour.

## Mendelian randomization analysis identifies druggable genes and drugs repurposing for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent condition that significantly impacts public health. Unfortunately, there are few effective treatment options available. Mendelian randomization (MR) has been utilized to repurpose existing drugs and identify new therapeutic targets. The objective of this study is to identify novel therapeutic targets for COPD.MethodsCis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) were extracted for 4,317 identified druggable genes from genomics and proteomics data of whole blood (eQTLGen) and lung tissue (GTEx Consortium). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data for doctor-diagnosed COPD, spirometry-defined COPD (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second [FEV1]/Forced Vital Capacity [FVC] <0.7), and FEV1 were obtained from the cohort of FinnGen, UK Biobank and SpiroMeta consortium. We employed Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), HEIDI test, and colocalization analysis to assess the causal effects of druggable gene expression on COPD and lung function. The reliability of these druggable genes was confirmed by eQTL two-sample MR and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) SMR, respectively. The potential effects of druggable genes were assessed through the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). Information on drug repurposing for COPD was collected from multiple databases.ResultsA total of 31 potential druggable genes associated with doctor-diagnosed COPD, spirometry-defined COPD, and FEV1 were identified through SMR, HEIDI test, and colocalization analysis. Among them, 22 genes (e.g., MMP15, PSMA4, ERBB3, and LMCD1) were further confirmed by eQTL two-sample MR and protein SMR analyses. Gene-level PheWAS revealed that ERBB3 expression might reduce inflammation, while GP9 and MRC2 were associated with other traits. The drugs Montelukast (targeting the MMP15 gene) and MARIZOMIB (targeting the PSMA4 gene) may reduce the risk of spirometry-defined COPD. Additionally, an existing small molecule inhibitor of the APH1A gene has the potential to increase FEV1.ConclusionsOur findings identified 22 potential drug targets for COPD and lung function. Prioritizing clinical trials that target these identified druggable genes with existing drugs or novel medications will be beneficial for the development of COPD treatments.

## Advances in fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus

date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Diabetes mellitus (DM) refers to a group of chronic diseases with global prevalence, characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from various etiologies. DM can harm various organ systems and lead to acute or chronic complications, which severely endanger human well-being. Traditional treatment mainly involves controlling blood sugar levels through replacement therapy with drugs and insulin; however, some patients still find a satisfactory curative effect difficult to achieve. Extensive research has demonstrated a close correlation between enteric dysbacteriosis and the pathogenesis of various types of DM, paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches targeting the gut microbiota to manage DM. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a method for re-establishing the intestinal microbiome balance, offers new possibilities for treating diabetes. This article provides a comprehensive review of the correlation between DM and the gut microbiota, as well as the current advancements in FMT treatment for DM, using FMT as an illustrative example. This study aims to offer novel perspectives and establish a theoretical foundation for the clinical diagnosis and management of DM.

## Causal associations between human gut microbiota and osteomyelitis: a Mendelian randomization study

date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecent studies have emphasized the role of gut microbiota in the onset and progression of osteomyelitis. However, the exact types of gut microbiota and their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of theoretical support for treatments that improve osteomyelitis by altering the gut microbiota.MethodsIn our study, we utilized the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to date from the MiBioGen consortium, involving 13,400 participants. The GWAS data for osteomyelitis were sourced from the UK Biobank, which included 4,836 osteomyelitis cases and 486,484 controls. We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization framework for a detailed investigation into the causal relationship between gut microbiota and osteomyelitis. Our methods included inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode approaches. Additionally, we applied Cochran’s Q statistic to assess the heterogeneity of the instrumental variable.ResultsAt the class level, Bacilli and Bacteroidia were positively correlated with the risk of osteomyelitis. At the order level, only Bacteroidales showed a positive association with osteomyelitis. At the genus level, an increased abundance of Butyricimonas, Coprococcus3, and Tyzzerella3 was positively associated with the risk of osteomyelitis, whereas Lachnospira was negatively associated. Sensitivity analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy.ConclusionThis study reveals that classes Bacilli and Bacteroidia, order Bacteroidales, and genera Butyricimonas, Coprococcus3, and Tyzzerella3 are implicated in increasing the risk of osteomyelitis, while the genus Lachnospira is associated with a reduced risk. Future investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms through which these specific bacterial groups influence the pathophysiology of osteomyelitis

## Endometrial microbiota alteration in female patients with endometrial polyps based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis

date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe potential role of the endometrial microbiota in the pathogenesis of endometrial polyps (EPs) warrants further investigation, given the current landscape of limited and inconclusive research findings. We aimed to explore the microecological characteristics of the uterine cavity in patients with EPs and investigate the potential of endometrial microbiota species as novel biomarkers for identifying EPs.MethodsEndometrial samples were collected from 225 patients who underwent hysteroscopies, of whom 167 had EPs, whereas 58 had non- hyperproliferative endometrium status. The endometrial microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We characterized the endometrial microbiota and identified microbial biomarkers for predicting EPs.ResultsThe endometrial microbial diversity and composition were significantly different between the EP and control groups. Predictive functional analyses of the endometrial microbiota demonstrated significant alterations in pathways involved in sphingolipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and apoptosis between the two groups. Moreover, a classification model based on endometrial microbial ASV-based biomarkers along with the presence of abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms achieved powerful classification potential in identifying EPs in both the discovery and validation cohorts.ConclusionOur study indicates a potential association between altered endometrial microbiota and EPs. Endometrial microbiota-based biomarkers may prove valuable for the diagnosis of EPs.Clinical trial registrationChinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100052746).

## Beyond pathogens: the intriguing genetic legacy of endogenous retroviruses in host physiology

date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The notion that viruses played a crucial role in the evolution of life is not a new concept. However, more recent insights suggest that this perception might be even more expansive, highlighting the ongoing impact of viruses on host evolution. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are considered genomic remnants of ancient viral infections acquired throughout vertebrate evolution. Their exogenous counterparts once infected the host’s germline cells, eventually leading to the permanent endogenization of their respective proviruses. The success of ERV colonization is evident so that it constitutes 8% of the human genome. Emerging genomic studies indicate that endogenous retroviruses are not merely remnants of past infections but rather play a corollary role, despite not fully understood, in host genetic regulation. This review presents some evidence supporting the crucial role of endogenous retroviruses in regulating host genetics. We explore the involvement of human ERVs (HERVs) in key physiological processes, from their precise and orchestrated activities during cellular differentiation and pluripotency to their contributions to aging and cellular senescence. Additionally, we discuss the costs associated with hosting a substantial amount of preserved viral genetic material.

## Molecular mechanisms of tigecycline-resistance among Enterobacterales

date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The global emergence of antimicrobial resistance to multiple antibiotics has recently become a significant concern. Gram-negative bacteria, known for their ability to acquire mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, represent one of the most hazardous microorganisms. This phenomenon poses a serious threat to public health. Notably, the significance of tigecycline, a member of the antibiotic group glycylcyclines and derivative of tetracyclines has increased. Tigecycline is one of the last-resort antimicrobial drugs used to treat complicated infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria or even pan-drug-resistant (PDR) bacteria. The primary mechanisms of tigecycline resistance include efflux pumps’ overexpression, tet genes and outer membrane porins. Efflux pumps are crucial in conferring multi-drug resistance by expelling antibiotics (such as tigecycline by direct expelling) and decreasing their concentration to sub-toxic levels. This review discusses the problem of tigecycline resistance, and provides important information for understanding the existing molecular mechanisms of tigecycline resistance in Enterobacterales. The emergence and spread of pathogens resistant to last-resort therapeutic options stands as a major global healthcare concern, especially when microorganisms are already resistant to carbapenems and/or colistin.

## Deep mutational scanning of the RNase III-like domain in Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing protein KREPB4

date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Kinetoplastid pathogens including Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania species, are early diverged, eukaryotic, unicellular parasites. Functional understanding of many proteins from these pathogens has been hampered by limited sequence homology to proteins from other model organisms. Here we describe the development of a high-throughput deep mutational scanning approach in T. brucei that facilitates rapid and unbiased assessment of the impacts of many possible amino acid substitutions within a protein on cell fitness, as measured by relative cell growth. The approach leverages several molecular technologies: cells with conditional expression of a wild-type gene of interest and constitutive expression of a library of mutant variants, degron-controlled stabilization of I-SceI meganuclease to mediate highly efficient transfection of a mutant allele library, and a high-throughput sequencing readout for cell growth upon conditional knockdown of wild-type gene expression and exclusive expression of mutant variants. Using this method, we queried the effects of amino acid substitutions in the apparently non-catalytic RNase III-like domain of KREPB4 (B4), which is an essential component of the RNA Editing Catalytic Complexes (RECCs) that carry out mitochondrial RNA editing in T. brucei. We measured the impacts of thousands of B4 variants on bloodstream form cell growth and validated the most deleterious variants containing single amino acid substitutions. Crucially, there was no correlation between phenotypes and amino acid conservation, demonstrating the greater power of this method over traditional sequence homology searching to identify functional residues. The bloodstream form cell growth phenotypes were combined with structural modeling, RECC protein proximity data, and analysis of selected substitutions in procyclic form T. brucei. These analyses revealed that the B4 RNaseIII-like domain is essential for maintenance of RECC integrity and RECC protein abundances and is also involved in changes in RECCs that occur between bloodstream and procyclic form life cycle stages.

## Research progress on the microbiota in bladder cancer tumors

date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The microbiota, also referred to as the microbial community, is a crucial component of the human microenvironment. It is located predominantly in various organs, including the intestines, skin, oral cavity, respiratory tract, and reproductive tract. The microbiota maintains a symbiotic relationship with the human body, influencing physiological and pathological functions to a significant degree. There is increasing evidence linking the microbial flora to human cancers. In contrast to the traditional belief that the urethra and urine of normal individuals are sterile, recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technology and bacterial cultivation methods have led to the discovery of specific microbial communities in the urethras of healthy individuals. Given the prevalence of bladder cancer (BCa) as a common malignancy of the urinary system, researchers have shifted their focus to exploring the connection between disease development and the unique microbial community within tumors. This shift has led to a deeper investigation into the role of microbiota in the onset, progression, metastasis, prognosis, and potential for early detection of BCa. This article reviews the existing research on the microbiota within BCa tumors and summarizes the findings regarding the roles of different microbes in various aspects of this disease.

## Isolation of mucosa-associated microbiota dysbiosis in the ascending colon in hepatitis C virus post-sustained virologic response cirrhotic patients

date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAchieving sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) reduces all-cause mortality. However, the mechanisms and risk factors for liver fibrosis and portal hypertension post-SVR remain incompletely understood. In the gut-liver axis, mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) substantially influence immune and metabolic functions, displaying spatial heterogeneity at the anatomical intestinal site. We analyzed MAM composition and function to isolate the locoregional MAM involved in chronic liver disease progression in HCV post-SVR patients.MethodsWe collected MAM samples from three intestinal sites (terminal ileum, ascending colon, and sigmoid colon) via brushing during colonoscopy in 23 HCV post-SVR patients and 25 individuals without liver disease (controls). The 16S rRNA of bacterial DNA in specimens collected with a brush and in feces was sequenced. The molecular expression of intestinal tissues and hepatic tissues were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR.ResultsIn the post-SVR group, the microbial β-diversity of MAM, especially in the ascending colon, differed from the control group and was associated with liver fibrosis progression. In PICRUSt analysis, MAM in the ascending colon in the liver cirrhosis (LC) group showed compromised functions associated with the intestinal barrier and bile acid production, and FGF19 expression was markedly decreased in the terminal ileum biopsy tissue in the LC group. At the genus level, six short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacterial genera, Blautia, Alistipes, Roseburia, Agathobaculum, Dorea, and Pseudoflavonifractor were reduced in the ascending colon of post-SVR LC patients.ConclusionIn patients of HCV post-SVR, we identified the association between the degree of liver fibrosis and dysbiosis of mucosa-associated SCFA-producing bacterial genera that may be related to intestinal barrier and bile acid production in the ascending colon.
