**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If we want to see even a modest reboot of blogging, as a community thing, we're going to have to start with something like blogrolls. I wrote a bit yesterday about how blogrolls came about, and weblogs.com and how that led to RSS and feed readers. This time, we don't have to wait for feeds to show up, they're already there. It should happen more quickly.

## If You Must Use Signal, Use Molly

date: 2024-02-29, from: mrusme blog

While I'm critical towards the Signal messenger, I understand that network
effects are strong and even though many people would much rather prefer a
different platform, it's not easy to get friends and family onto something
better. In this brief write-up, I'll introduce an alternative Signal client to
make using Signal at least slightly less troublesome.

## What do we know about DOIs

date: 2024-02-29, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Crossref holds metadata for approximately 150 million scholarly artifacts. These range from peer reviewed journal articles through to scholarly books through to scientific blog posts. In fact, amid such heterogeneity, the only singular factor that unites such items is that they have been assigned a document object identifier (DOI); a unique identification string that can be used to resolve to a resource pertaining to said metadata (often, but not always, a copy of the work identified by the metadata).</p>
<p>What, though, do we actually know about the state of persistence of these links? How many DOIs resolve correctly? How many landing pages, at the other end of the DOI resolution, contain the information that is supposed to be there, including the title and the DOI itself? How can we find out?</p>
<p>The first and seemingly most obvious way that we can obtain some of these data is by working through the most recent sample of DOIs and attempting to fetch metadata from each of them using a standard python script. This involves using the httpx library to attempt to resolve each of the DOIs to a resource, visiting that resource and seeing what the landing page yields.</p>
<p>Even this is not straightforward. Landing pages can be HTML resources or they can be PDF files, among other things. In the case of PDF files, to detect a run of text is not simple as a single line break can be enough to foil our search. Nonetheless, when using this strategy we find the following statistics:</p>
<p>Total DOI count in sample: 5000<br>
Number of HTTP 200 response: 3301*<br>
Percentage of HTTP 200 responses: 66.02%<br>
Number of titles found on landing page: 1580<br>
Percentage of titles found on landing page: 31.60%<br>
Number of DOIs in recommended format found on landing page: 1410<br>
Percentage of DOIs in recommended format found on landing page: 28.20%<br>
Number of titles and DOIs found on landing page: 929<br>
Percentage of titles and DOIs found on landing page: 18.58%<br>
Number of PDFs found on landing page: 1469<br>
Percentage of PDFs found on landing page: 29.38%<br>
Percent of PDFs found on landing pages that loaded: 44.50%</p>
<p>* an HTTP 200 response means that the web page loaded correctly</p>
<p>While these numbers look quite low, the problem here is that a large number of scholarly publishers use Digital Rights Management techniques on their sites that block a crawl of this type. We can use systems like Playwright to remote control browsers to do the crawling, so that the request looks as much like a genuine user as possible and to evade such detection systems. However, lots of these sites detect headless browsers (where the browser is invisible and running on a server) and block them with a 403 Permission Denied error.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/infosimples/detect-headless" target="_blank">a great Github javascript suite</a> that aims to help evade headless detection. The tests it uses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User Agent: in a browser running with puppeteer in headless mode, user agent includes Headless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Version: same as User Agent above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plugins: headless browsers don&rsquo;t have any plugins. So we can say that if it has plugin it&rsquo;s headful, but not otherwise since some browsers, like Firefox, don&rsquo;t have default plugins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plugins Prototype: check if the Plugin and PluginsArray prototype are correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mime Type: similar to Plugins test, where headless browsers don&rsquo;t have any mime type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mime Type Prototype: check if the MimeType and MimeTypeArrayprototype are correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Languages: all headful browser has at least one language. So we can say that if it has no language it&rsquo;s headless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Webdriver: this property is true when running in a headless browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time elapse: it pops an alert() on page and if it&rsquo;s closed too fast, means that it&rsquo;s headless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chrome element: it&rsquo;s specific for chrome browser that has an element window.chrome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permission: in headless mode Notification.permission and navigator.permissions.query report contradictory values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devtool: puppeteer works on devtools protocol, this test checks if devtool is present or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broken Image: all browser has a default nonzero broken image size, and this may not happen on a headless browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outer Dimension: the attributes outerHeight and outerWidth have value 0 on headless browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connection Rtt: The attribute navigator.connection.rtt,if present, has value 0 on headless browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mouse Move: The attributes movementX and movementY on every MouseEvent have value 0 on headless browser.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the stealth plugin for Playwright also allows us to evade most of these checks. This just leaves Mouse Move and Broken Image detection, which I thought would not outweigh all the other factors. We can also jitter the connection with arbitrary delays so that it should appear to be coming at random intervals, rather than a robotic crawl.</p>
<p>Yet the basic fact is that we are still blocked from crawling many sites. This does not happen when we put the browser into headful mode, so current detection techniques have clearly evolved in the past half decade (since Detect Headless) was designed.</p>
<p>If, however, we run the browser in a headful mode, the results are somewhat stunningly different:</p>
<p>Total DOI count in sample: 5000<br>
Number of HTTP 200 response: 4852<br>
Percent of HTTP 200 responses: 97.04%<br>
Number of titles found on landing page: 2547<br>
Percentage of titles found on landing page: 50.94%<br>
Number of DOIs in recommended format found on landing page: 2424<br>
Percentage of DOIs in recommended format found on landing page: 48.48%<br>
Number of titles and DOIs found on landing page: 1574<br>
Percentage of titles and DOIs found on landing page: 31.48%<br>
Number of PDFs found on landing page: 2085<br>
Percentage of PDFs found on landing page: 41.70%<br>
Percentage of PDFs found on landing pages that loaded: 42.97%</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the resolution statistics. Other studies, looking at general links on the web, have found a link-rot rate of about 60%-70% over a ten-year period <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?jyT6HY" target="_blank">(Lessig, Zittrain, and Albert 2014; Stox 2022)</a>. The DOI resolution rate that we have, with 97% of links resolving (or a 3% link-rot rate), is far better and more robust than a web link in general.</p>
<p>Is 3% a good or a bad number? It&rsquo;s more robust than the web in general, but it still means that for every 100 DOIs, just under 3 will fail to resolve. We also cannot tell whether these DOIs are resolving to the correct target, except by using the metadata detection metrics (are the title and DOI on the landing page, which we could only detect at a far lower rate). It is entirely possible for a website to resolve with an HTTP 200 (OK) response, but for the page in question to be something very different to what the user expected, a phenomenon dubbed content drift. A good example is domain hijacking, where a domain name expires and spam companies buy them up. These still resolve to a web page, but instead of an article on RNA, for a hypothetical example, the user gets adverts for rubber welding hose. That said, other studies are also prone to this and there is no guarantee that content drift doesn&rsquo;t affect a huge proportion of supposedly good links in the other studies, too.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the most frustrating elements of this exercise is having to work around publisher blocks on content when visiting using a server-only robot script. It&rsquo;s important for us periodically to monitor the uptime rate of the DOI system. We also recognise, though, that publishers want to block malicious traffic. However, we can&rsquo;t perform our monitoring in an easy, automatic way if headless scripts are blocked from resolving DOIs and visiting their respective landing pages. This is not even a call for open access; it&rsquo;s just saying that current anti-bot techniques, sometimes implemented for legitimate reasons, stifle our ability to know the landscape. Even if the bot resolved a DOI to just a paywall, it would be easier for us to monitor this than it is now. Similarly, CAPTCHA systems such as Cloudflare that would seem to offer an easy way to distinguish between humans (good) and robots (bad) can make life very difficult at the monitoring end. We would certainly be grateful for any proposed solution that could help us to work around these mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The context in which I wanted to know this information was so that we can take a snapshot of a page and then, at a later stage, determine whether it is down or has changed substantially. To do this, we are developing <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/shelob/" target="_blank">Shelob</a>, an experimental content drift spider system; that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve used so far to conduct this analysis. Over time, Shelob will evolve, we hope, to give us a way to detect when content has drifted or gone offline. If, however, we can&rsquo;t detect whether an endpoint is good in the first place, then we likewise cannot detect when things have gone wrong. On the other hand, if, when we first visit, we find the DOI and title on the landing page, but at some future point this degrades, we might be able to say with some confidence that the original has died. I, personally, would encourage publishers not to block automated crawlers, because it&rsquo;s good when we can determine these types of figures.</p>

## KDE Plasma 6 released

date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News

KDE Plasma 6 has been released &#8211; and this is an important release with two massive low-level stack upgrades. With Plasma 6, our technology stack has undergone two major upgrades: a transition to the latest version of our application framework, Qt, and a migration to the modern Linux graphics platform, Wayland. We have done our best to ensure that these changes are as smooth and unnoticeable to the users as possible, so when you install this update, you will see the same familiar desktop environment that you know and love. But these under-the-hood upgrades benefit Plasma&#8217;s security, efficiency, and performance, and improve support for modern hardware. Thus Plasma delivers an overall more reliable user experience, while paving the way for many more improvements in the future. Aside from this, there&#8217;s so much in this release it&#8217;s hard to know where to begin. My favourite is the overhaul of KDE&#8217;s default Breeze theme, which now uses far, far fewer frames, meaning there&#8217;s fewer borders-on-borders. Spacing has also been made more consistent within Breeze. Both of these efforts make KDE applications and UI elements look a bit less cluttered and busy, which, while easily missed if you don&#8217;t look for it, certainly cleans things up nicely. Another important improvements is the addition of support for HDR displays and colour management. Plasma on Wayland now has partial support for High Dynamic Range (HDR). On supported monitors and software, this will provide you with richer and deeper colors for your games, videos, and visual creations. Set an ICC profile for each screen individually and Plasma will adjust the colors accordingly. Applications are still limited to the sRGB color space, but we are working on increasing the number of supported color spaces soon. To improve Plasma&#8217;s accessibility, we added support for color blindness correction filters. This helps with protanopia, deuteranopia or tritanopia. Of course, this release is accompanied by updates to a large number of KDE applications, and several default settings in KDE have been changed as well to better suit what most users would expect. Plasma Search has been overhauled as well, making it faster and less resource-intensive, and giving users the ability to better control how search results are displayed. There&#8217;s a lot more here, so be sure to dive into the release announcement, KDE Plasma 6 will find its way to your distribution or operating system of choice over the coming weeks and months.

## 2024-02-28 Use of a calendar

date: 2024-02-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-28 Use of a calendar</h1>

<p>In the last millennium, I used the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diary.html">Emacs Diary</a> for my calendar. I mean, why not? The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html">Emacs Calendar</a> is great. Better than the <code>cal</code> command-line utility, in any case. But eventually the world got mobile phones and I wanted an online calendar.</p>

<p>The example from the Emacs Diary documentation:</p>

<pre><code>12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
10/22       Ruth's birthday.
* 21, *:    Payday
Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
         Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
mar 16      Dad's birthday
April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
* 15        time cards due.
</code></pre>

<p>Back then, Google didn&rsquo;t want to be evil and I used Google Calendar.
When Google changed its mind, so did I.
I switched to <a href="2020-06-10_Radicale_for_Calendar_and_Contacts">Radicale</a>.</p>

<p>And yet, I sort of missed those diary file entries.</p>

<p>Today, <a class="account" href="https://social.tadzik.net/users/tadzik" title="@tadzik@social.tadzik.net">@tadzik</a> posted a link to <a href="https://codeberg.org/tadzik/caleb">caleb</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>caleb</code> will do its best to interpret a calendar event description, create a valid iCalendar event for it and optionally upload it to a CalDAV server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice!</p>

<p>Example usage, from the README:</p>

<pre><code>$ caleb friday 5pm beer
</code></pre>

<p>My main problem was that it took me a while to figure out what the correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> URL is. I looked into my iPhone accounts (my first mistake) and tried <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex</code>, then <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/</code>, then <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/Alex</code> – some of these URLs failed silently, some of them created new collections with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> filename as the collection name… and I didn&rsquo;t get an warnings or error messages. I mean, it makes sense. It&rsquo;s like a filesystem, you can save whatever you want. But it&rsquo;s not what the calendar apps expect.</p>

<p>So, how do I discover the correct URL? Using a command-line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> explorer like <code>cadaver</code>. The following example shows how I log into Radicale and list the contents of the two directory I found. One of them is full of <code>.vcf</code> files (contacts), the other is full of <code>.ics</code> files (calendar entries). That&rsquo;s the one!</p>

<pre>

## New Wear OS devices run two operating systems

date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News

Wear OS smartwatches have a dual-chipset architecture inclusive of a powerful application processor (AP) and ultra low-power co-processor microcontroller unit (MCU). The architecture has a powerful AP capable of handling complex operations en-masse, and is seamlessly coupled with a low power MCU. The Wear OS hybrid interface enables intelligent switching between the MCU or the AP, allowing the AP to be suspended when not needed to preserve battery life. It helps, for instance, achieve more power-efficient experiences, like sensor data processing on the MCU while the AP is asleep. At the same time, the hybrid interface provides a seamless transition between these states, keeping a rich and premium user experience without jarring transitions between power modes. ↫ Kseniia Shumelchyk on the Android Developers Blog The new OnePlus Watch 2 is the first to use this new architecture, and the most interesting part is that it runs not one, but two operating systems: Wear OS, which is Android, running on the &#8220;AP&#8221;, and a smaller RTOS that runs on the &#8220;MCU&#8221;. In the case of the OnePlus Watch 2, the &#8220;AP&#8221; is a Snapdragon W5, while the &#8220;MCU&#8221; is a BES 2700, an ultra low power microcontroller. I can&#8217;t seem to find any information on this &#8220;RTOS&#8221;, but I&#8217;d really love to know what it&#8217;s based on.

## Tumblr and WordPress owner is striking deals with OpenAI and Midjourney for training data, says report

date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News

Speaking of collecting data, here&#8217;s another major content player signing a deal to sell your content to &#8220;AI&#8221; companies. The owner of Tumblr and WordPress.com is in talks with AI companies Midjourney and OpenAI to provide training data scraped from users’ posts, a report from 404 Media alleges. The report, based on an anonymous source inside the company, says that deals between Automattic and the two AI companies are “imminent.” It follows nebulous rumors that have spread on Tumblr over the past week, suggesting a deal with Midjourney could provide a new revenue stream for the site. ↫ Adi Robertson at The Verge We use WordPress for OSNews, but it seems this only applies to content hosted at WordPress.com, not on WordPress installations hosted elsewhere.

## Meta will start collecting “anonymized” data about Quest headset usage

date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News

Meta will soon begin &#8220;collecting anonymized data&#8221; from users of its Quest headsets, a move that could see the company aggregating information about hand, body, and eye tracking; camera information; &#8220;information about your physical environment&#8221;; and information about &#8220;the virtual reality events you attend.&#8221; In an email sent to Quest users Monday, Meta notes that it currently collects &#8220;the data required for your Meta Quest to work properly.&#8221; Starting with the next software update, though, the company will begin collecting and aggregating &#8220;anonymized data about&#8230; device usage&#8221; from Quest users. That anonymized data will be used &#8220;for things like building better experiences and improving Meta Quest products for everyone,&#8221; the company writes. ↫ Kyle Orland at Ars Technica Is it just me, or is the idea of Facebook collecting this type of data in particular just exceptionally creepy? I mean, browsing history or whatever is one thing &#8211; already bad enough &#8211; but hand, body, and eye movements, and camera information? Of course, this was the only expected course for Quest owners, but now that the time is here, it still feels just as creepy as when we first imagined it when Facebook bought Oculus.

## Is The New York Times’ newsroom just a bunch of Ivy Leaguers? (Kinda, sorta.)

date: 2024-02-28, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The New York Times is the most prominent news organization in the United States — and, by general consensus, the pinnacle of the journalism career ladder. Sure, star reporters sometimes leave the Times for a rival — but more often, it&#8217;s the Times that&#8217;s busy snapping up other outlets&#8217; talent. Fifteen years ago, it employed...

I'm waiting for someone to give me the tools to index my own content so ChatGPT knows about it. I want it to learn my codebase so I can ask it questions about places I've used a feature before. I want to write code in a very high level language I invent as I go and have it compile it to JavaScript. Come on, what's holding things up. This will be the ultimate productivity software. The first one who gets there owns the world or at least deserves a nice prize and our thanks.

I use Safari on my iPad. The software just updated, and they widened the width of icons in the browser chrome. This knocked three of my links over into the menu, out of easy reach. Why did they feel they could change something so basic? After using the iPad for 14 freaking years, why shake up this tiny little corner of the system? What's the possible benefit. Or maybe this is just a bug and they'll fix it? This is the kind of thing that makes me put off updating. Yeah I know it sounds small, but I really use my freaking iPad. It isn't just for watching movies. I can't tell you how many iPads I've bought. It's ridiculous. Come on Apple, I'm a customer not a slave.

Another way to think about it. What if, say in California or New York, 15% of the Democrats voted uncommitted to make sure Biden knows he's expected to stand up strong for reproductive rights. That helps clear the way with any Democrats who feel they should go slowly. Voters expressing their political strength. Again, that's pure democracy. It's the best.

Biden is a Democrat, and Netanyahu is a MAGA. Remember that. They are not friends, and Biden has dropped very explicit hints that he's thinking that way. So give him an excuse to kick Netanyahu in the ass, and he'll be happy to do it. But he can't openly threaten Israel now, not with Trump over there saying he'd cut NATO, and thanks to him we're ditching Ukraine, even though Trump isn't in office. All of our alliances are fragile now, and getting worse every time Trump says or does something awful. Biden has to take it steady. I listened to the interviews with advocates for uncommitted, and no one even remotely suggested they'll vote for Trump or a Republican. This is democracy. It's good. That's as American as it gets.

But they totally behave like a blogging community. I remember when I was starting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000621103057/http://www.weblogs.com/">weblogs.com</a>, I wanted to get an idea of when sites were updating, so I didn't have to go hunting through a blogroll, clicking on links to find out if there was anything new. So I wrote a script that worked off a list of blogs, read each one in turn, and compared it with the last version we read, and if there was a change, it would move it to the top of the list. I didn't just make it for myself, I shared it with everyone. There was a mail list where people were freaking out about this. The server that would read their blog every so often was called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+subhonker">subhonker</a>. This was something new and they were scared. I couldn't show them the benefit until the script had been running for a while. Everyone got upset. I remember being confused and scared, but I guess from their point of view it looked scary. I don't know. In the end weblogs.com became really popular, it became the central place to find out what's new with blogs, and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123225500/http://weblogs.com/stories/">evolved</a> to use <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> so we could find changes in even more detail. I guess the thing is people should see the benefit before they see the price? And as an innovator, we have to be aware of this, people may not see the benefit until they can <i>use</i> it.

This prompted me to, once again, do the old mental dance of &ldquo;Ugh, I haven&rsquo;t even used this account in years, should I just delete it?&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d want a backup first&hellip;&rdquo; culminating in the power move of &ldquo;omg how many thousands of photos and gifsets did I reblog on this account? The backup&rsquo;s going to be like 100GB!&rdquo; (OK, I guess that&rsquo;s not a power move? The &ldquo;dancing&rdquo; metaphor got away from me a bit.) I really don&rsquo;t even care about 99% of this; I just want the political theory stuff I had so meticulously tagged. I requested an export anyway, but if what it produces doesn&rsquo;t let me browse posts by tag (as I suspect it won&rsquo;t) it won&rsquo;t be very useful to me.</p>
<p>Oh and, I also found that my crazy online hater who&rsquo;s been sending me the odd hateful screed since I was literally 16 years old sent another couple just last month. Sounds like they&rsquo;ve embraced full-on Nazism now, which makes a change from when they were just obsessed with Michael Jackson. (Basically, this person hates me because my teenage self made a really sensitive and nuanced blog post, as 16-year-olds do, that I didn&rsquo;t care about ol&rsquo; <abbr title="Michael Jackson">MJ</abbr> dying because he was probably a pedo. Little did I know I was creating a nemesis who would dog me until the end of time&hellip;)</p>

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2024-02-28, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>Last night I was cooking a chicken stew, and I had to double-check my recipe to remember which herbs I put in it (rosemary, thyme, basil, sage and a bay leaf). As I was grabbing the little jars out of the cupboard, it occurred to me that this list is pretty similar to that famous lyric – <q>parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</q> – and wondered, &ldquo;Hmm, why is it I never put parsley in this? Or, actually, into anything?&rdquo; So I pulled out my little jar of parsley, gave the contents a sniff (parsley really doesn&rsquo;t have a very appealing smell, hey) and read the description on the jar&rsquo;s side:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A popular herb used to garnish or add a touch of colour to your favourite meal. Great with sauces and egg dishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo; I remembered. &ldquo;Parsley is so crap that even the parsley jar can only suggest adding it to anything for cosmetic reasons. That&rsquo;s why I never use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly, it&rsquo;s time we change the line in that song to &ldquo;basil, sage, rosemary and thyme&rdquo;. And a bay leaf.</p>

## The Yak Shave

date: 2024-02-28, from: Marginallia log

I set out a little over a week ago to add a service registry to Marginalia Search, primarily to reduce its dependence on docker. I would like it to be able to run on bare metal as well, which poses a problem since configuring the application manually is a bit of a headache with dozens of ports that need to be set up. It would also be desirable to be able to run multiple instances of important services in order elliminate downtime during upgrades.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

In the 80s there was a tech press that reviewed software, and explained OSes and hardware, so you really had a good idea what was going on. They just don't do that anymore. Haven't for many years. But along comes ChatGPT and I can get a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e8b8e861-4345-45c4-a5bb-8e5b7432b240">comparitive review</a> of hosting services that compete with Digital Ocean, just by asking for it. I wanted to get an idea of how easy it would be to create an open source app so it could be easily deployed, on any of them and what the pros and cons were. I asked for a comparison between Digital Ocean (where I host my servers now) and Amazon, Microsoft, Google and I threw in <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>, just to anchor the whole thing simplicity-wise. Even InfoWorld wouldn't have done such an in-depth review. This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity">productivity</a> revolution, at least.

## On POSSE

date: 2024-02-27, from: Manu - I write blog

<p><strong>P</strong>ublish (on your) <strong>O</strong>wn <strong>S</strong>ite, <strong>S</strong>yndicate <strong>E</strong>lsewhere. It's one of the principles of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">IndieWeb</a>. It’s the idea that your content should live on your site, on a domain name you own and you should then distribute that content in as many places as possible. Overall it’s a nice idea but one I never felt compelled to make mine.</p>
<p>My content lives here, on my site. Everything in here is under my control and it’s then distributed through three distribution channels.</p>
<p>The first—and most obvious—is the web itself. My content is distributed to you via the Internet. You can ask your browser to get this page you’re reading right now and get access to my content.</p>
<p>The second is RSS. You can tell your RSS reader to fetch the content available on my website and you can then consume my content inside your app of choice.</p>
<p>The final one is email. I send my posts via email because some people prefer to stay up to date that way and who am I to prevent that from happening?</p>
<p>But these three methods only take care of distribution and distribution of content is only part of the equation. You then have interaction. The point of putting content out there is to connect, to interact with others, to exchange ideas, and to grow. And interactions, in my world, happen via email. 95% of the interactions I have happen via email with the occasional message on iMessage. Both of those communication methods are always monitored because they live on my Mac and my phone.</p>
<p>Now, what if I were to follow the POSSE mantra? I’d probably sign up for a bunch of different services and scatter my content everywhere there are people. But those people might then comment and try to get in touch with me on those platforms. Platforms I’d then have to monitor. And I don’t know about you, but I don’t have time for that. And if I don’t check them, those are lost connections, missed opportunities to interact with other human beings.</p>
<p>That to me is a terrible outcome and it’s why don’t want to distribute my content outside of those three channels. But maybe I’m wrong so if you have a different opinion please reach out.</p>

## Former Student Launch Competitor Turns Experience into NASA Engineering Career

By Jessica Barnett Sometimes, all it takes is a few years and the right people to completely change a person’s career trajectory.

## Adding Full Post Content to my RSS Feed

date: 2024-02-27, from: Nora Tindall's blog

A reader reached out to me the other day to let me know that my RSS feed for this blog didn&rsquo;t include post content, just descriptions, and that this hindered their ability to read my posts offline. This obviously isn&rsquo;t ideal, so I set about adding the full post content.
Customizing the RSS Feed Hugo comes with a builtin RSS feed template, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to override. Simply copy the contents of this file to the themes/[theme name]/layouts/_default directory, and then edit to your heart&rsquo;s content.

## 2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me

date: 2024-02-27, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me</h1>

<p>I was thinking about joining the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara">Tangara</a> crowdfunding. It&rsquo;s a kind of iPod, but better in that it is all open. Yay!</p>

<p>But then I realized something: Having an iPhone made listening to music such a shit show that I basically stopped and switched my entire phone-based audio entertainment to podcasts. Because podcast clients are great (at least <a href="https://icatcher.app/about/">iCatcher</a> is) where as Apple Music is a pain. Having used iTunes when it was cool until it was unusable, and then realizing what a pain the weird AAC formats on the files were, and the DRM on some of them, preventing me from playing them on other machines I owned. I was so angry.</p>

<p>In a fit of hate I decided I was going to <a href="2019-07-08_Apple_Photos">move all my pictures out of iPhotos</a> and all my music out of iTunes and never go back. And I did. And so the Apple Music app died, and I guess no alternatives were allowed on the App Store because Apple is great like that, and so when the iPod classic I had with <a href="2017-12-21_Rockbox_on_the_iPod">Rockbox</a> installed <a href="2022-11-18_iPod%2C_iPad%2C_iPhone%2C_iPiss">finally died</a>, all I was left with was podcasts on the iPhone.</p>

<p>And so now I don&rsquo;t even know whether I want to listen to music any more while I&rsquo;m on the move.</p>

<p>Apple killed music on the move, for me.</p>

<p>At home it&rsquo;s a different story, of course, but Tangara is a portable music player.</p>

<p>I wish Tangara the best of luck.</p>

<p><strong>2024-02-27</strong>. I joined the Kickstarter. Not because I have a terribly good feeling about it but because I remember wanting a portable audio player and I recently found, once again, that I really hate the Apple Music app.</p>

## Microsoft wants to update your Windows 11 PC without forcing you to reboot

date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News

If there&#8217;s one thing Windows users hate about Windows, it&#8217;s Windows updates interrupting your workflow or gaming session with a popup asking you to restart your PC finish installing the latest security update. It happens at least once a month, because that&#8217;s how often Microsoft rolls out security updates to Windows PCs. This may soon be a thing of the past, as the company is now testing an update method called &#8220;hot patching&#8221; for Windows 11 PCs. Hot patching is already in use on some Windows Server editions, as well as Xbox, and now it appears the company is preparing to bring it to devices running Windows 11. ↫ Zac Bowden at Windows Central A welcome, good improvement every Windows user is going to benefit from. This is the kind of improvements Microsoft should really be focusing on, instead of adding more ads or useless &#8220;AI&#8221; features.

## A history of the tty

date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News

It&#8217;s one of those anachronisms that is deeply embedded in modern technology. From cloud operator servers to embedded controllers in appliances, there must be uncountable devices that think they are connected to a TTY. I will omit the many interesting details of the Linux terminal infrastructure here, as it could easily fill its own article. But most Linux users are at least peripherally aware that the kernel tends to identify both serial devices and terminals as TTYs, assigning them filesystem names in the form of /dev/tty*. Probably a lot of those people remember that this stands for teletype or perhaps teletypewriter, although in practice the term teleprinter is more common. ↫ J. B. Crawford I remember first using Linux in like 2000 or 2001, and running into the abbreviation tty, and not having a single clue what that meant since I came from a DOS and Windows background. Over time I gained a lot more understanding of the structure of modern UNIX-like systems, but it&#8217;s still great to read such a detailed history of the concept.

## Fast Poetry and pre-commit with GitHub Actions

date: 2024-02-27, from: Max Halford Blog

This is a short post to share a GitHub Actions pattern I use to setup Poetry and pre-commit. These two tools cover most of my Python development needs. I use Poetry to manage dependencies and pre-commit to run code checks and formatting. The setup is fast because it caches the virtual environment and the .local directory.
I like to use custom actions for this type of stuff. These are base actions that can be re-used in multiple workflows.

## Developers’ fireside chat – 2nd March

## Scopetrex

date: 2024-02-25, from: Microcores blog



<p>Since I started hacking on computer hard- and software in the 1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6809" title="Motorola 6809">Motorola's
6809 processor</a> is one of my favorite 8-bit CPUs. The 6809 is the last generation of Motorola's 8-bit CPU family, which started with the 6800 in 1974 and also was used in a number of microcontrollers of the 6805, HC11 and 9S12 families. The latter are still used in automotive applications today. If you know the 6502, the 6809 feels quite familiar, since it has an identical bus interface and very similar assembler programming model without some of the constraints of the 6502 such as an 8-bit stack pointer or a lack of 16-bit address registers. This is not really surprising, since a number of Motorola 6800 engineers left the company to develop the 6502 and then joined MOS.</p>

<p>However, the 6809 only came to the market in 1978 - only a year before the 68000 - and thus was quite late (and also rather expensive compared to the 6502 and Z80). Only a few home computers used the processor, e.g. the Dragon 32 and 64, the Tandy Color Computer and Thompson's MO5 and TO7.</p>

<p>Another system which used the 6809 was a quite special game console, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex" title="Vectrex">Vectrex</a>. Instead of a standard raster-based screen, the Vectrex used its CRT as a vector display by controlling the X and Y deflection as well as the intensity of the CRT's electron beam directly. This is done by generating analog voltages for the X and Y position using an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC0808). Since DACs were quite expensive back then, the single DAC analog output is multiplexed using a CD4052 analog multiplexer to the various connectors. The rest of the Vectrex hardware is rather simple. A 6522 VIA connects to the DAC and some control functions and a AY3-8912 chip generates sound and provides another 8-bit port to interface to the Vectrex controllers. The remaining chips are an 8 kB ROM, 1 kB of SRAM (32 kB in the Scopetrex), some 74-series glue logic and a number of op-amps and other analog chips to generate the analog signal outputs.</p>

<p>Vectrexes were only built for about two years and unfortunately have become highly sought after (read: expensive) collector's items. Luckily, since the Vectrex uses only standard components, it is rather simple to build a clone. The software situation is also quite nice, since Jay Smith, then head of Smith Engineering (the designer of the Vectrex), allowed new hard/software development on a fee- and royalty-free basis and has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a not-for-profit basis.</p>

<p>Such a Vectrex clone is available in form of the <a href="https://github.com/schlae/scopetrex" title="Scopetrex">Scopetrex by TubeTime</a>. This is not a 100% replica since it uses a different PCB form factor and a 32 kB SRAM instead of the original 1 kB, but is perfectly compatible with all original software. It's a good project to get started with a more complex hardware build if you have some soldering experience and most of the parts are still available new from vendors such as Digikey or Mouser. The 6809 CPU (you will need at least the 1.5 MHz version 68A09, a 68B09 will also work fine - both the versions with internal clock generator and the one without that has the "E" suffix can be used) and the sound chip (a AY3-8910 or YM2149 can also be used) can be easily found on aliexpress.</p>

<p>My Vectrex build worked out of the box, now I only need to find a suitable vector display. You can use an oscilloscope in X-Y mode, but most modern scopes no longer feature a Z (intensity) input, so the display is disturbed by vectors which should not be drawn (intensity = 0). If you have an old analog Hameg 203, this will work nicely... A picture of the successful bringup is shown below.</p>

<p>By concidence, <a href="https://itwww.hs-pforzheim.de/daten/mitarbeiter/johannsen/vectrex_lab/projects/scopetrex/scopetrex.htm" title="Scopetrexes">a colleague in Germany has also started building Scopetrexes</a>. Small world...</p>

## I have a new* website

date: 2024-02-25, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>Well, kinda. It’s not really new as you can see. The typeface is—probably—still the same, the layout is mostly the same but lots of things have changed. Let me go through them</p>
<h2>Typefaces</h2>
<p>This site is now—potentially—using web fonts. I’m saying potentially because if you’re reading this on a Mac or on something running iOS you’re probably seeing a system font. My old site was designed around the Iowan typeface but that’s only available on iOS and Mac so most people were seeing a different version using one of the other available serif typefaces. That choice was because I went through a phase where I was trying to push my site toward extreme minimalism. And if you ask me, I had quite the success in that regard. My site was just 1 single HTTP request, the CSS was stupidly optimized and everything was stupid fast and stupid lightweight. But the designer in me was bothered by this and I decided to bring back a web font. If you’re on Windows or Android you’re now getting served Iowan as a web font. I’m also now using a sans-serif font for a couple of small details. I have no idea what you’re seeing because I’m defaulting on a system font.</p>
<p>I also messed with the typography a little bit and changed a few things here and there but the site should still feel mostly the same. I’m not done fine-tuning all this and I’m sure I’ll keep changing little things here and there for months but I had enough and I decided to push it live.</p>
<h2>New “Where do you go from here?” section</h2>
<p>Back when I designed my site, that section between the content of the post and the archive was meant to be a place to store my contact info and not much else. But it ended up being a place to dump all sorts of stuff and there were just too many links and I didn’t want to add more to make things worse.</p>
<p>That’s why I decided to rethink that section entirely and it’s now a lot more organised but still quite minimal. All the old links are still there but now there’s direct access to two new things.</p>
<h2>Guestbook</h2>
<p>The first of those two new things is a <a href="/guestbook">guestbook</a>. I thought about making one months ago but back then I didn’t want to mess with my site. But now it’s here and I can’t wait to see what you people out there are going to write on it.</p>
<h2>Supporters</h2>
<p>The second is the <a href="/supporters">supporters</a> page. I don’t want kindness to go unnoticed and I plan to make that page a lot more useful and structured. I want to provide as much value as possible to those who are kind enough to support what I do and that’s going to be just one of the places where I plan to do it.</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m quite happy with this subtle refresh. My site’s been the same for almost 7 years at this point but I still think it works quite well so I don’t want to completely redesign it. At least not yet. Maybe in another 7 years.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">my inbox is always open</a> so if you want to share your thoughts you know what to do. And don’t forget to sign my guestbook!</p>

## Lisp in Small Processors

date: 2024-02-25, from: Microcores blog



<p>While AI is all the rage again, the previous AI wave was focusing on languages like Lisp and Prolog and even built hardware with special processors optimized to execute Lisp code, made by companies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics" title="Symbolics">Symbolics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machines" title="Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI)">Lisp Machines, Inc.</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_Explorer" title="TI Explorer">Explorer Series by Texas Instruments</a>. The machines used OSes written in Lisp and provided the user with large, bitmapped screens to operate a mouse-based GUI and networking.</p>

<p>Lisp machines originated at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu" title="MIT's AI Lab">MIT's AI Lab</a> and were influential for a number of reasons. A certain Richard Stallman was a graduate student at the AI Lab and unhappy with the commercialization of the Lisp technology by LMI and Symbolics, started to develop Free Software such as Emacs and the gcc compiler and started the Free Software Foundation. The LMI LAMBDA machine was based on Western Digital's NuBus bus system and was subsequently acquired by TI to create the Explorer. </p>

<p>The NuBus was, in turn, used by Motorola 68k-based Macintosh and early PowerPC systems as well as the NeXT Cube. These NuBus-based Macs were subsequently used to create personal Lisp workstations which employed a VLSI integrated Lisp chip and used the Mac as I/O system. Both Symbolics and TI offered such a system, MacIvory and MicroExplorer, respectively. The latest development is an emulator of Symbolics Lisp machines, the <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?GeneraOs" title="Genera OS">Genera OS</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you own a MacIvory or MicroExplorer card you want to sell, please get in touch</strong></p>

<p>However, there were also efforts to implement Lisp on smaller machines, including popular 8-bit CPUs. The <a href="https://archive.org/details/BYTE_Vol_04-08_1979-08_Lisp" title="BYTE August 1979">August 1979 issue of BYTE magazine</a> was dedicated to Lisp and did not only provide a lot of background on the language and its application, but also published the implementation of a Lisp interpreter written by S. Tucker Taft in assembly for the Motorola 6800. Unfortunately, the space in that issue was constrained, so only a part of the interpreter source code was published and the complete code could be ordered from BYTE. 45 years later, this is no longer possible, so I thought the code was lost...</p>

<p>Thanks to the power of Mastodon, Pablo Marx (thanks a lot!) managed to find the original listing of that Lisp implementation and sent me <a href="files/BYTE_6800_LISP_Interpreter.pdf" title="Lisp source PDF">the scanned document as PDF</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/pablomarx/lisp6800" title="Github 6800 Lisp repository">a link to his github repository with the 6800 Lisp code</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested to know how a low-level implementation of a Lisp VM, including the REPL, lambdas, and a garbage collector works, I can recommend taking a look at this article and the accompanying source code. I'm thinking of porting the VM to my <a href="https://github.com/schlae/scopetrex" title="Scopetrex">Scopetrex Vectrex game console clone</a>. This is a fascinating piece of hardware based on Motorola's 6809 CPU, the successor of the 6800, which is not binary compatible. However, the <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/13975/how-did-the-6809-achieve-source-code-compatibility-with-the-6800" title="conversion">assembler source code can be easily converted</a>. The Vectrex and the Scopetrex clone use a vector CRT display, which makes developing software for the system quite interesting.</p>

<p>Automatic conversion of the assembly code should also be possible, e.g. there is a <a href="https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Manuals/Programming/6502-6809Translator%20%28Computer%20Systems%20Consultants%29.pdf" title="6502 to 6809 converter">6502 to 6809 converter</a>.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVWZy4QOy0">Beatles song</a>, by John Lennon, that was written by cribbing promotional items from a 19th-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_for_the_Benefit_of_Mr._Kite!#Background">circus poster</a>. It's kind of like asking ChatGPT to give you some random phrases and presenting that as your creativity. I think I'm going to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/4aafde35-2903-48e3-88c0-bcd8725ac702">try that now</a>. I asked ChatGPT to write a poem using ideas from a random song written by John Lennon. It chose Imagine. I asked that it write a poem using the ideas in Day Tripper. And finally I asked it to write a song based on the story of The Matrix.

## I spy Pi Wi-Fi with my little eye

date: 2024-02-25, from: RiscOS Open

<p>It&#8217;s the number two most <a href="/bounty/polls/32">popular bounty</a> we&#8217;ve ever run (by votes) and following a surge in pledges this year, we&#8217;re excited to be able to confirm Wi-Fi to <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 5 now underway.</p>
<p>Visitors to the <a href="/news/articles/2023/12/03/a-festive-mug"><span class="caps">MUG</span> Christmas market</a> last December will already have seen the proof-of-principle driver targetting the Raspberry Pi. Drivers aren&#8217;t the most <a href="https://www.iconbar.co.uk/news/uploaded/2023/mug/fair/19.jpeg">visually exciting</a> part of the OS, but they&#8217;re the foundation on which higher level functionality is built.</p>

<p>5 out of 7 installed, but can probably delete WhatsApp until I travel to Europe again.  That, and I need to double down on the moisturizer.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/25/tinytinylittletextbox.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">BTW, apparently my <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/24.html#a161904">post</a> yesterday where I said I was "doing some of my best writing in ChatGPT" was confusing. I meant literally what I said. <i>My</i> writing. Not that I was using ChatGPT to do my writing for me. I can understand that some people do that, writing isn't one of their things. However writing is one of my things. I've been writing every day for almost <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">thirty years</a>. My writing style has changed a lot over the years. I don't necessarily think it's gotten better, it's just different. I would never post writing publicly written by a anyone other than me without saying it was. Writing for me is very personal. On the other hand, I don't draw very well, never have. I used to be good at box diagrams with arrows, but I'm really out of practice. So if you see something colorful here, that <i>was</i> drawn by a bot, unless it says otherwise. I think we all have to be very clear about that. Now, I do write a lot in ChatGPT because I'm trying to get it to help me solve problems, almost always technical. Basically you have to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/b4235922-c4e2-4996-89cf-48c34cf2af67">sketch</a> out the problem in English very specifically so it gives you back what you want. I never thought I'd be programming in English, but here I am doing it. I really want a copy of everything I write, because someday I might want to feed it into a bot other than ChatGPT. There's the lock-in. <i>They own part of me, and I don't even get a copy. </i>Yes yes I know I can download individual conversations, but not if they include an image btw, did you think of that? And who has time to remember to download them. This is fucked up. One of my action items is to hook <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a> up to their API so I'm not relying on their editor. Every time you find yourself typing into a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text box</a> the alarms should go off.

## Marginalia: 3 Years

date: 2024-02-25, from: Marginallia log

It&rsquo;s been three years since the inception of Marginalia Search, then a dinky experiment to find where the heck the cool Internet has gone, now my full time job.
While there&rsquo;s always things that can be improved, it&rsquo;s fair to say the search engine has never worked as well as it does right now.
A great number of milestones have been reached, perhaps biggest of all the search engine has moved out of my living room and into a proper enterprise server.
