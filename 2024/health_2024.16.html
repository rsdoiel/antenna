assessment of HF-rTMS treatment mechanism for post-stroke dysphagia in
rats by integration of fecal metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe mechanism by which high-frequency repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) improves swallowing function
by regulating intestinal flora remains unexplored. We aimed to evaluate
this using fecal metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing.MethodsA
Post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) rat model was established by middle cerebral
artery occlusion. The magnetic stimulation group received HF-rTMS from
the 7th day post-operation up to 14th day post-surgery. Swallowing
function was assessed using a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS).
Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to assess
histopathological changes in the intestinal tissue. Intestinal flora
levels were evaluated by sequencing the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region.
Metabolite changes within the intestinal flora were evaluated by fecal
metabolomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry.ResultsVFSS showed that the bolus area and pharyngeal bolus
speed were significantly decreased in PSD rats, while the bolus area
increased and pharyngeal transit time decreased after HF-rTMS
administration (p &lt; 0.05). In the PSD groups, H&amp;E staining
revealed damaged surface epithelial cells and disrupted cryptal glands,
whereas HF-rTMS reinforced the integrity of the intestinal epithelial
cells. 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that PSD can disturb the intestinal
flora and its associated metabolites, whereas HF-rTMS can significantly
regulate the composition of the intestinal microflora. Firmicutes and
Lactobacillus abundances were lower in the PSD group than in the
baseline group at the phylum and genus levels, respectively; however,
both increased after HF-rTMS administration. Levels of ceramides (Cer),
free fatty acids (FA), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), triacylglycerol
(TAG), and sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol were increased in the PSD
group. The Cer, FA, and DG levels decreased after HF-rTMS treatment,
whereas the TAG levels increased. Peptococcaceae was negatively
correlated with Cer, Streptococcus was negatively correlated with DG,
and Acutalibacter was positively correlated with FA and Cer. However,
these changes were effectively restored by HF-rTMS, resulting in
recovery from dysphagia.ConclusionThese findings suggest a synergistic
role for the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in the development of
PSD and the therapeutic mechanisms underlying HF-rTMS.</p>

of a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification test for the sensitive,
rapid, and economic detection of different genotypes of Classical swine
fever virus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundClassical swine fever virus (CSFV) remains one of the most
important pathogens in animal health. Pathogen detection relies on viral
RNA extraction followed by RT-qPCR. Novel technologies are required to
improve diagnosis at the point of care.MethodsA loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) PCR technique was developed, with primers designed
considering all reported CSFV genotypes. The reaction was tested using
both fluorometric and colorimetric detection, in comparison to the gold
standard technique. Viral strains from three circulating CSFV genotypes
were tested, as well as samples from infected animals. Other pathogens
were also tested, to determine the LAMP specificity. Besides laboratory
RNA extraction methods, a heating method for RNA release, readily
available for adaptation to field conditions was evaluated.ResultsThree
primer sets were generated, with one of them showing better performance.
This primer set proved capable of maintaining optimal performance at a
wide range of amplification temperatures (60°C - 68°C). It was also able
to detect CSFV RNA from the three genotypes tested. The assay was highly
efficient in detection of samples from animals infected with field
strains from two different genotypes, with multiple matrices being
detected using both colorimetric and fluorometric methods. The LAMP
assay was negative for all the unrelated pathogens tested, including
Pestiviruses. The only doubtful result in both fluorometric and
colorimetric LAMP was against the novel Pestivirus italiaense, ovine
Italy Pestivirus (OVPV), which has proven to have cross-reaction with
multiple CSFV diagnostic techniques. However, it is only possible to
detect the OVPV in a doubtful result if the viral load is higher than
10000 viral particles.ConclusionThe results from the present study show
that LAMP could be an important addition to the currently used molecular
diagnostic techniques for CSFV. This technique could be used in remote
locations, given that it can be adapted for successful use with minimal
equipment and minimally invasive samples. The joined use of novel and
traditional diagnostic techniques could prove to be a useful alternative
to support the CSF control.</p>
