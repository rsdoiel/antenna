## 2024-04-22 Gopher, again

date: 2024-04-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-22-gopher-again">2024-04-22 Gopher, again</h1>

<p>Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Oddmu">Oddmu</a> using a version of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully grafted onto the Gemini server I’m using, I figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable Gopher pages again.</p>

<p>It took some wrangling and it’s probably not great, but the main menu matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site is back as a gopher hole on port 70!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git">patched Satellite</a> for the Gemini server code, <a href="2023-11-03-other-ports">discussed back in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>And naturally I’m immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in this client I’m using.</p>

## Using Legitimate GitHub URLs for Malware

date: 2024-04-22, updated: 2024-04-22, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting social-engineering <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-comments-abused-to-push-malware-via-microsoft-repo-urls/">attack vector</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>McAfee released a report on a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-cheat-lures-gamers-into-spreading-infostealer-malware/">new LUA malware loader</a> distributed through what appeared to be a legitimate Microsoft GitHub repository for the &#8220;C++ Library Manager for Windows, Linux, and MacOS,&#8221; known as <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg">vcpkg</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The attacker is exploiting a property of GitHub: comments to a particular repo can contain files, and those files will be associated with the project in the URL.</p>
<p>What this means is that someone can upload malware and &#8220;attach&#8221; it to a legitimate and trusted project.</p>
<blockquote><p>As the file&#8217;s URL contains the name of the repository the comment was created in, and as almost every software company uses GitHub, this flaw can allow threat actors to develop extraordinarily crafty and trustworthy lures...</p></blockquote>

## Post(news) Script

date: 2024-04-22, from: Om Malik blog

Post.News, a Twitter-like news-first social&#160;network,&#160;is shutting&#160;down.&#160;It is not surprising.&#160;It lacked dynamism and excitement, even&#160;as an early adopter and a former media&#160;professional. Given&#160;the&#160;overwhelming emphasis they put on establishment&#160;media, I am not surprised.&#160;The last time I visited&#160;Post.News&#160;was to read founder Noah Bardin’s post. “Our service is not growing fast enough to become a real business or a &#8230;

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-04-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I hate paywalls tied to subscription. I’m never going to subscribe to a Philadelphia news org, but based on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jayrosen.bsky.social/post/3kqnxdwej3s2c">Jay’s recommendation</a> I might pay $1 on my <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/04/130438.html?title=howEzpassForNewsWouldWork">EZ Pass for News</a> to read <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/civil-war-movie-about-journalism-20240421.html">this story</a>, esp since I saw the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(film)">Civil War</a> movie. I just had a thought, I might subscribe to a Philadelphia news org for a week or two, given that the Knicks are playing their NBA team right now in the first round of the playoffs. I really want to know everything there is to know about this faceoff. See, I want to pay for journalism here, but journalism hasn't been willing to sell it to me, at any price. They've never gotten the basic truth of: "The customer is always right." Really important point and true in every way.

After a little more testing and docs-writing we'll be ready for other people to test it, an important step before wider use. So if you're a regular Scripting News reader, and are curious what this blogroll stuff is about, you'll be able to try it out pretty soon.

## Gilead revisited

date: 2024-04-22, from: Ayjay blog

The way we speak and think of the Puritans seems to me a serviceable model for important aspects of the phenomenon we call Puritanism. Very simply, it is a great example of our collective eagerness to disparage without knowledge or information about the thing disparaged, when the reward is the pleasure of sharing an attitude [&#8230;]

## Three Myths About the Scientific Method

This is the third in a series on the scientific method.&nbsp; This installment is a little bit of a tangent, but I wanted to publish it now because I've gotten tired of having to correct people about these things all the time.&nbsp; I figured if I just wrote this out once and for all I could just point people here rather than having to repeat myself all the time.There are a lot of myths and

## Maldives 2024

date: 2024-04-21, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="maldives-2024">Maldives 2024</h1>

<p>The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.</p>

<p>The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane, Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the <a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible, too.</p>

<p>With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in 2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to the Maldives.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Pictures">#Pictures</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Maldives">#Maldives</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-06</strong>.
The last leg of the journey – our water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the reef begins a few meters in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10 before we left.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to hide in the sand.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in Australia or the Galapagos.
This purple giant is cool, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are still plenty of colourful fish.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games.
The most popular tropical island game is Race for the Galaxy.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday we also played <a href="http://mixedsignals.ml/games/petition/">Petition</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@klaatu" title="@klaatu@mastodon.xyz">@klaatu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.</p>

<p>We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily scared and therefore obviously harmless.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.</p>

<p>There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work on the tourist islands.</p>

<p>The capital city is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a> book. Check out these stats from the <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia page on the Maldives</a>:
In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement from the point of view of the locals.</p>

<p>From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don&rsquo;t know what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in the the fish. People eat the fish. It&rsquo;s easy to feel grim about this. I need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much, much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look away.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-12</strong>. Bad luck for Claudia. Yesterday, late at night, she stuck her small toe in a gap between two planks, took another step, nearly fell and twisted her foot. There’s a huge dark bruise on its back and a significant dark bruise below. No more fins, for a while. 😭</p>

<p>We had signed up for a snorkel safari when suddenly the buzz was that the young humpback whale they had seen two days ago was still around and so the ship picked up some extra passengers and Claudia came along to do some whale watching.</p>

<p>The whale watching did not disappoint.</p>

<p>This adolescent <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale">humpback whale</a> was about 8m long. It’s unusual to find a whales here, now, so close to the reef, so young, without its family. There was speculation that it might be waiting for its family to pick it up again, or that perhaps it was sick.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-13</strong>. To it is raining. Good for Claudia since she is supposed to rest her foot.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-16.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-21</strong>. After snorkling with the whale, not much seemed to be worth posting about.</p>

<p>Before going on this trip, I bought an older GoPro HERO 10. Now I have a few gigabytes of reef snorkeling footage. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. Post it? Unlikely! It takes too much space and nobody would look at it. Donate it to YouTube? Unlikely! Upload it to some Peertube instance and thereby offload the cost? Unlikely.</p>

<p>Regarding the economy of the Maldives and the shock when I learned about the garbage island and my dismay when I saw the skyline of Malé island – when we flew back, I got a closer look at Malé from the air as we landed and while it wasn&rsquo;t an island nature paradise, it was just a city with nice, tall buildings and roads and palm trees and construction sites and glass fronts and cars and motorcycles. In other words, it seemed like a perfectly normal city and it wasn&rsquo;t shabby and it didn&rsquo;t have slums and so I keep coming back to the main issue: Beating poverty is of ultimate importance in order to improve people&rsquo;s lives and giving them options so that they can work on the problems they care about. When we flew over Thilafushi, the garbage island didn&rsquo;t look &ldquo;apocalyptic&rdquo; but just like some industrial zone elsewhere in the world, except it&rsquo;s an island in the middle of the ocean.</p>

## This Thing is Bigger Than Journalism

date: 2024-04-21, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Journalism as we knew it is washing away. But the story is bigger than journalism alone, and bigger than a story alone can tell. (Image borrowed from the brilliant Despair.com.) We who care about journalism are asked to join the Save Journalism Project, and its fight against Big Tech. Their pitch begins, and adds, On the first point, we [&#8230;]

Technology has given us instant access to everything. From internet with all of humanity’s knowledge, to food delivery at our door, or even cat videos, you have an app for it. But technology has also given everybody access to you, and that’s bad. Not everything requires an instant response, nobody will die if you answer [&#8230;]

## Global nutrient transfer

date: 2024-04-21, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Trade and exchange have been around essentially forever. How much is too much, though? How far is too far? How do the critical quantities of phosphate mined in the Western Sahara and sent to fertilize farms all over the world compare with peat moss harvested fifty miles from me and used to feed gardens like [&#8230;]
