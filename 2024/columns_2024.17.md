**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-04-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

When I started working with Automattic last year, one of the big milestones we were aiming for was getting FeedLand and WordPress working together. Now we have <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/24/132025.html?title=feedlandAndWordpress">the first step</a>. I hope you take a moment to give it a try and let us know how it works. Scripting News readers have helped bootstrap all kinds of cool stuff, we can do it again.

## FeedLand and WordPress

date: 2024-04-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll">new plugin</a> that adds a <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> to a WordPress site. </p>
<p>It would be helpful if people who are regular readers of Scripting News who use WordPress, set up a test site, give it a try and let us know how it goes. You can help us get to the next level with this stuff. </p>
<p>So there are two sides, the FeedLand side and the WordPress side.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The FeedLand side</b>. <a href="https://feedland.com/?signonscreen=true">Sign on</a> to FeedLand, create an account if you don't have one, and subscribe to a bunch of feeds. These will be the feeds in your blogroll.  There are some tips on how to find feeds, in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/24/132025.html#a134443">next section</a>.</li>
<li><b>The WordPress side</b>. There's a <a href="https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll">new plugin</a>, developed by the people at the Team51 group at Automattic. They have a <a href="https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll/blob/trunk/README.md">checklist</a> for how to install the plugin in a WordPress site. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions or comments, or need help getting it working, post a note in the <a href="">discussion group</a> here. </p>
<p>You can get ideas for feeds for your blogroll from reading other people's feed lists. When you see a checkbox that isn't checked, you can subscribe to the feed simply by checking the box. </p>
<p>Have a look at <a href="https://feedland.com/?username=davewiner">my feed list</a> for ideas. Here's a list of <a href="https://feedland.com/?userslist">recent users</a>, click on their names to see their feed lists. You don't have to finish this now, you can come back and tune this up anytime.</p>
<p>Developers: Use <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandBlogrollToolkit">feedlandBlogrollToolkit</a> to add blogrolls to other platforms. </p>

## Dan Solove on Privacy Regulation

date: 2024-04-24, updated: 2024-04-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Law professor Dan Solove has a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4333743">new article</a> on privacy regulation. In his email to me, he writes: &#8220;I‚Äôve been pondering privacy consent for more than a decade, and I think I finally made a breakthrough with this article.&#8221; His mini-abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this Article I argue that most of the time, privacy consent is fictitious. Instead of futile efforts to try to turn privacy consent from fiction to fact, the better approach is to lean into the fictions. The law can&#8217;t stop privacy consent from being a fairy tale, but the law can ensure that the story ends well. I argue that privacy consent should confer less legitimacy and power and that it be backstopped by a set of duties on organizations that process personal data based on consent...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-04-24 Micro-blogs

date: 2024-04-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-24-micro-blogs">2024-04-24 Micro-blogs</h1>

<p>Recently, I jokingly replied to <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@jameschip" title="@jameschip@merveilles.town">@jameschip</a> when he said &ldquo;maybe we need a new word for types of blogs that have comments and federation&rdquo; that we should have kept the word micro-blogs. Regular blogs, with a character limit.</p>

<p>Then again, micro-blogs in that sense, from Identi.ca to GNU Social, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and the Fediverse now have a big plus: Notification actually works. If you mention another account, they get notified. If you get a reply, you get notified. It&rsquo;s glorious.</p>

<p>For regular blogs, notification works with the oldest, universal, federated, communication medium online: email. Conversely, if you don&rsquo;t have email or don&rsquo;t do, you don&rsquo;t get notified and most likely you can&rsquo;t even comment. üòê</p>

<p>I tried web-mentions and they didn&rsquo;t work I wanted them to. Far too few other blogs supported them, and for this blog, I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with them. I didn&rsquo;t want to send myself email so I turned them into comments, but mentions aren&rsquo;t as strong a signal as a comment. Mentions aren&rsquo;t public but comments are. Mentions don&rsquo;t need a strong connection to the main article but comments do. By turning mentions into comments, I had made a mistake and the result was frustrating. So <a href="2023-09-20-web-mentions-vs-referrals">I got rid of them</a>.</p>

<p>And so here we are, it&rsquo;s 2024, and blogs still don&rsquo;t have good (spam-free) comments and notifications where as micro-blogs do. üò¢</p>

Friends, Many of you say that the worst aspect of the fraught political time we&#8217;re going through as the 2024 election looms is what it&#8217;s doing to your relationships with members of your family &#8212; with your parents, your children, your in-laws, and your siblings.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-04-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I don't have time to write about it now but the end of last night's Knicks game was one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VUvcuHwgtw">most dramatic bits</a> of NY sports ever. I would like to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/">thank Kevin Durant</a> for saying the Knicks weren't cool. It's somewhat like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand Effect</a> where the thing KD was trying to hide was that <i>he</i> was no longer cool. Classic <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/projection">projection</a>. Obviously he was not the hot shit he thought he was in 2019. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

I'd like to combine AI and search to make a really great search engine for bloggers. We would contribute what we know (we already do) and in return, along with everyone else, get to benefit from the collection. And when we browse, <i>it knows which blog we write.</i> So it has a very good idea of what we mean when we ask a question and what we already know. This is totally missing in ChatGPT and is something Google and other search engines have never been willing to do (or even understood, I guess). But this is a huge idea. I'd like to give it <a href="https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=blogroll">my blogroll</a> too, so it knows which sources I consider credible. I love that it creates an incentive to post to your blog, and it makes <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether">working together</a> automatic.

I was chatting with a friend who went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science">Bronx Science</a>, as I did, and we were talking about Isaac Asimov, and I said I thought he went to Science too. So I fired up ChatGPT and asked if Asimov went to Science, and <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/81199c5a-ca0a-4a2c-b610-e0799722a03f">it said yes</a>. Then I asked where he went to high school and it said Bronx Science. But by then I was pretty sure he didn't, so I went to Google and meta.ai, and neither knew where he went to high school. So I asked on Twitter, Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/112321321415008740">Blue Sky</a> and Threads. Not sure why I even care! Oh well. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

You may have seen a Bitcoin Teller Machine (BTM) and wondered who would use one and and why. I have, there is one in our local Safeway. Elijah Nicholson-Messmer and Ella Ceron look into BTMs in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22"><i>Bitcoin ATMs Flood Black, Latino Areas, Charging Fees up to 22%</i></a>. The headline sums up the story well, but there is a rather interesting sting in the tail of their article.<br />

Follow me below the fold as I discuss the article and finally get to why the sting in the tail is interesting..<br />

The article <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">starts</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The BTM industry surged during the pandemic: The number of installed units increased more than five-fold over four years to about 31,100 units nationwide, <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/country/226/bitcoin-atm-united-states/">according to</a> Coin ATM Radar. But a closer look into the BTM boom revealed that the machines are often disproportionately located in areas with a majority of Black and Latino residents, charging fees as high as 22% per transaction.

Bitcoin Depot, "the largest US operator with about 7,300 BTMs as of April 8", naturally denies the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">implication</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A Bloomberg review of Bitcoin Depot locations and data from the Census Bureau shows that states with proportionally large Black and Latino populations tend to have more of the company‚Äôs BTMs, especially in southern states like Georgia and Texas. Bitcoin Depot President and Chief Executive Officer Brandon Mintz dismissed any suggestion that the company targeted areas with underrepresented groups in deciding where to place its machines.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúNever in our history have we once targeted an area based on any sort of racial profile,‚Äù Mintz told Bloomberg News. ‚ÄúOur focus is targeting areas that have low competition and that have populations that can support a Bitcoin ATM profitably.‚Äù
</blockquote>
But clearly there is something different about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">the populations of these areas</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In Alabama, the concentration of Black and Latino residents within a mile radius of Bitcoin Depot BTMs is 20 percentage points higher than the broader state average, per a Bloomberg analysis of location data and the 2022 American Consumer Survey. In Dallas, BTMs are consistently located in areas where the highest percentages of Black and Latino people live. 
</blockquote>
Among the mantras the crypto-bros never tire of repeating is that they are "banking the unbanked" and promoting <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">"financial inclusion"</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Proponents of cryptocurrency often tout the asset as a way to reach unbanked people, who lack a more traditional bank account. In the US, that comprised 6% of adults in 2022, per the Federal Reserve. Black and Hispanic people were more likely to be more unbanked than their White counterparts.
</blockquote>
The BTM operators are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">no exception</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin Depot, the largest US operator with about 7,300 BTMs as of April 8, charges some of the highest fees in the industry while touting <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/country/226/bitcoin-atm-united-states/">financial inclusion</a>, a concept that ensures that all customers, regardless of their socioeconomic standing, have access to such financial services as savings, credit and insurance. Over 80% of Bitcoin Depot‚Äôs customers earn less than $80,000 a year, according to <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_f35c9984c4e67907bcfb05c59f7a314b/bitcoindepot/db/3583/33137/pdf/Bitcoin+Depot+Investor+Presentation_Q3-2023_120623+.pdf">a November 2023 investor presentation</a> from the company.
</blockquote>
I am a bit baffled as to how HODL-ing Bitcoin would provide "access to such financial services as savings, credit and insurance". I don't think Equifax and Trans-Union pay attention to your pseudonymous HODL-ings.  And there is the matter of the fees the BTM operators charge for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">providing this access</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Mintz, the Bitcoin Depot CEO, said the percentage of a transaction the Atlanta-based company retains as its fees is typically in the ‚Äúlow twenties,‚Äù but would not provide a bottom or top boundary. ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs definitive, it just depends on the market and what we need to do to cover our expenses,‚Äù Mintz said.   The company also charges a flat $3 fee on every transaction<br />
...<br />
CoinFlip and Bitstop, Bitcoin Depot‚Äôs main rivals, charge transaction fees as high as 22%, depending on the location, according to company representatives and customer service agents. CoinFlip also charges a ‚Äúnetwork fee‚Äù of $2.49 on every transaction. 
</blockquote>
How do the BTMs end up in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">locations near people lacking "financial inclusion"</a>?<br />
<blockquote>
One restaurant owner in Essex, Maryland, who declined to give his name, said Bitcoin Depot paid $145 a month for the kiosk that was installed a month ago. Another store owner in New Jersey, who identified himself only as Jai, said his store received $200 a month for the kiosk, also operated by Bitcoin Depot.
</blockquote>
$145/month at 22% would be the fees on $660/month in transactions, and $200/month would be the fees on $909/month, which puts a floor on the business these BTMs do. It is likely much higher.<br />
<br />
With all that as background, now for the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/bitcoin-atms-flood-black-latino-areas-charging-fees-up-to-22">sting in the tail</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The majority of BTMs ‚Äî 92% of machines in the US, as indexed by Coin ATM Radar ‚Äî don‚Äôt allow users to sell their crypto in exchange for cash.
</blockquote>
These machines are the Roach Motels of banking, your cash can check in but it can't check out.
The question in my mind is:<br />
<blockquote>
What kind of customer needs to pay 22% plus $3 for "access to ... financial services" which <i>won't let you cash out</i>?
</blockquote>
Clearly, someone who cannot use conventional banks which, even if they do charge fees, will let you take money out. Two kinds of customers come immediately to mind:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Criminals</b>, who are willing to pay high fees to launder their ill-gotten cash into Bitcoin, which they will then convert into Tether at some exchange.</li>
<li><b>Victims</b> of crimes such as <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/more-on-pig-butchering.html">pig-butchering</a>, where the perpetrators require payment in Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>

date: 2024-04-23, updated: 2024-04-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Former senior White House cyber policy director A. J. Grotto <a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2024/04/21/microsoft_national_security_risk/">talks about the economic incentives</a> for companies to improve their security&#8212;in particular, Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote><p>Grotto told us Microsoft had to be &#8220;dragged kicking and screaming&#8221; to provide logging capabilities to the government by default, and given the fact the mega-corp banked around $20 billion in revenue from security services last year, the concession was minimal at best.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&#8220;The government needs to focus on encouraging and catalyzing competition,&#8221; Grotto said. He believes it also needs to publicly scrutinize Microsoft and make sure everyone knows when it messes up...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-04-22 Gopher, again

date: 2024-04-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-22-gopher-again">2024-04-22 Gopher, again</h1>

<p>Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Odd¬µ</a> using a version of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>, the Gemini server I‚Äôm using, based on renderer code I found in the <a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a> that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Odd¬µ, I figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable Gopher pages.</p>

<p>It took some wrangling and it‚Äôs probably not great, but the main menu matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site is back as a gopher hole on port 70!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git">patched Satellite</a> for the Gemini server code, <a href="2023-11-03-other-ports">discussed back in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>And naturally I‚Äôm immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in this client I‚Äôm using.</p>

## Using Legitimate GitHub URLs for Malware

date: 2024-04-22, updated: 2024-04-22, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting social-engineering <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-comments-abused-to-push-malware-via-microsoft-repo-urls/">attack vector</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>McAfee released a report on a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-cheat-lures-gamers-into-spreading-infostealer-malware/">new LUA malware loader</a> distributed through what appeared to be a legitimate Microsoft GitHub repository for the &#8220;C++ Library Manager for Windows, Linux, and MacOS,&#8221; known as <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg">vcpkg</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The attacker is exploiting a property of GitHub: comments to a particular repo can contain files, and those files will be associated with the project in the URL.</p>
<p>What this means is that someone can upload malware and &#8220;attach&#8221; it to a legitimate and trusted project.</p>
<blockquote><p>As the file&#8217;s URL contains the name of the repository the comment was created in, and as almost every software company uses GitHub, this flaw can allow threat actors to develop extraordinarily crafty and trustworthy lures...</p></blockquote>

## Three Myths About the Scientific Method

date: 2024-04-21, updated: 2024-04-22, from: Ron Garret

This is the third in a series on the scientific method.&nbsp; This installment is a little bit of a tangent, but I wanted to publish it now because I've gotten tired of having to correct people about these things all the time.&nbsp; I figured if I just wrote this out once and for all I could just point people here rather than having to repeat myself all the time.There are a lot of myths and

## Maldives 2024

date: 2024-04-21, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="maldives-2024">Maldives 2024</h1>

<p>The biosphere as we know it is ending and I‚Äôm spending two weeks in the Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.</p>

<p>The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane, Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the <a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible, too.</p>

<p>With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in 2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to the Maldives.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Pictures">#Pictures</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Maldives">#Maldives</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-06</strong>.
The last leg of the journey ‚Äì our water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the reef begins a few meters in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10 before we left.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to hide in the sand.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There‚Äôs sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Black tipped reef sharks‚Ä¶ harmless! At a later point we did see it attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most corals look dreary! It‚Äôs certainly not as colourful and busy as in Australia or the Galapagos.
This purple giant is cool, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are still plenty of colourful fish.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whenever we‚Äôre away on a trip, we play games.
The most popular tropical island game is Race for the Galaxy.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday we also played <a href="http://mixedsignals.ml/games/petition/">Petition</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@klaatu" title="@klaatu@mastodon.xyz">@klaatu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.</p>

<p>We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they‚Äôre slow and easily scared and therefore obviously harmless.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when you‚Äôre snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.</p>

<p>There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can stay on the ‚Äúlocal islands‚Äù since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work on the tourist islands.</p>

<p>The capital city is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Mal√© on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism ‚Äì but I know what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a> book. Check out these stats from the <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia page on the Maldives</a>:
In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement from the point of view of the locals.</p>

<p>From my green perspective, though‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs not forget the garbage island <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don&rsquo;t know what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in the the fish. People eat the fish. It&rsquo;s easy to feel grim about this. I need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much, much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre wondering why I‚Äôm basically skimming, reading and finally summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look away.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-12</strong>. Bad luck for Claudia. Yesterday, late at night, she stuck her small toe in a gap between two planks, took another step, nearly fell and twisted her foot. There‚Äôs a huge dark bruise on its back and a significant dark bruise below. No more fins, for a while. üò≠</p>

<p>We had signed up for a snorkel safari when suddenly the buzz was that the young humpback whale they had seen two days ago was still around and so the ship picked up some extra passengers and Claudia came along to do some whale watching.</p>

<p>The whale watching did not disappoint.</p>

<video src="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-15.mov" poster="2024-04-06-maledives-15.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" controls muted>

<a alt="Video of the whale slapping its fin" href="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-15.mov">5 second video</a>
</video>

<p>This adolescent <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale">humpback whale</a> was about 8m long. It‚Äôs unusual to find a whales here, now, so close to the reef, so young, without its family. There was speculation that it might be waiting for its family to pick it up again, or that perhaps it was sick.</p>

<video src="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-14.mov" poster="2024-04-06-maledives-14.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" controls muted>

</video>

<p><strong>2024-04-13</strong>. To it is raining. Good for Claudia since she is supposed to rest her foot.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-16.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-21</strong>. After snorkling with the whale, not much seemed to be worth posting about.</p>

<p>Before going on this trip, I bought an older GoPro HERO 10. Now I have a few gigabytes of reef snorkeling footage. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. Post it? Unlikely! It takes too much space and nobody would look at it. Donate it to YouTube? Unlikely! Upload it to some Peertube instance and thereby offload the cost? Unlikely.</p>

<p>Regarding the economy of the Maldives and the shock when I learned about the garbage island and my dismay when I saw the skyline of Mal√© island ‚Äì when we flew back, I got a closer look at Mal√© from the air as we landed and while it wasn&rsquo;t an island nature paradise, it was just a city with nice, tall buildings and roads and palm trees and construction sites and glass fronts and cars and motorcycles. In other words, it seemed like a perfectly normal city and it wasn&rsquo;t shabby and it didn&rsquo;t have slums and so I keep coming back to the main issue: Beating poverty is of ultimate importance in order to improve people&rsquo;s lives and giving them options so that they can work on the problems they care about. When we flew over Thilafushi, the garbage island didn&rsquo;t look &ldquo;apocalyptic&rdquo; but just like some industrial zone elsewhere in the world, except it&rsquo;s an island in the middle of the ocean.</p>
