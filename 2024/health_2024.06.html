<title>
Purpose
</title>
<p>
The aim of the work was to analyze the metabolites of the intestinal
microbiota from the patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
progressive MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Method
</title>
<p>
Two cohorts were established. The first one included 87 subjects with 30
healthy controls (NC), 22 patients with MCI due to AD, and 35 patients
with AD. The second cohort included 87 patients with MCI due to AD, who
were followed up for 2 years and finally were divided into progressive
MCI due to AD group (P-G) and unprogressive MCI due to AD group (U-G)
according their cognitive levels. Fecal samples were collected to all
patients at the baseline time point. Differential metabolites were
subjected to pathway analysis by MetaboAnalyst.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
In the first cohort, we found 21 different metabolites among the three
groups (AD, MCI, and NC). In the second cohort, we identified 19
differential metabolites between the P-G and U-G groups. By machine
learning analysis, we found that seven characteristic metabolites
[Erythrodiol, alpha-Curcumene, Synephrine, o-Hydroxylaminobenzoate,
3-Amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2-Deoxystreptamine, and 9(S] were of
characteristic significance for the diagnosis of MCI due to AD, and six
metabolites (Indolelactate, Indole-3-acetaldehyde, L-Proline, Perillyl,
Mesaconate, and Sphingosine) were the characteristic metabolites of
early warning for the progression of MCI due to AD. D-Glucuronic acid
was negatively correlated with Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4). Perillyl
alcohol was negatively correlated with all of the five biomarkers
[P-tau181, Neurofilament light chain (NF-light), Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, and
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)], but Indoleacetaldehyde was
positively correlated with three biomarkers (P-tau181, Aβ1-42, and
GFAP). Three characteristic metabolites (3-Amino-4-hydroxybenzoate,
2-Deoxystreptamine, and p-Synephrine) were positively correlated with
Aβ1-42. 2-Deoxystreptamine, 9(S)-HPOT, and Indoleacetaldehyde were
positively correlated with GFAP. L-Proline and Indoleacetaldehyde were
positively correlated with NF-light.

Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Specific metabolites of intestinal fora can be used as diagnostic and
progressive markers for MCI.

atlas of gross and histologic lesions and immunohistochemical
immunoreactivity during the temporal progression of aerosolized Lassa
virus induced hemorrhagic fever in cynomolgus macaques</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Lassa virus (LASV) causes an acute multisystemic hemorrhagic fever in
humans known as Lassa fever, which is endemic in several African
countries. This manuscript focuses on the progression of disease in
cynomolgus macaques challenged with aerosolized LASV and serially
sampled for the development and progression of gross and histopathologic
lesions. Gross lesions were first noted in tissues on day 6 and
persisted throughout day 12. Viremia and histologic lesions were first
noted on day 6 commencing with the pulmonary system and hemolymphatic
system and progressing at later time points to include all systems.
Immunoreactivity to LASV antigen was first observed in the lungs of one
macaque on day 3 and appeared localized to macrophages with an increase
at later time points to include immunoreactivity in all organ systems.
Additionally, this manuscript will serve as a detailed atlas of
histopathologic lesions and disease progression for comparison to other
animal models of aerosolized Arenaviral disease.

id="the-significance-of-gut-microbiota-in-the-etiology-of-autoimmune-hepatitis-a-narrative-review">The
significance of gut microbiota in the etiology of autoimmune hepatitis:
a narrative review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
liver that is mediated by autoimmunity and has complex pathogenesis. Its
prevalence has increased globally. Since the liver is the first organ to
be exposed to harmful substances, such as gut-derived intestinal
microbiota and its metabolites, gut health is closely related to liver
health, and the “liver-gut axis” allows abnormalities in the gut
microbiota to influence the development of liver-related diseases such
as AIH. Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and its
resultant disruption of the intestinal barrier and microbial transport
are involved in multiple ways in the disruption of immune homeostasis
and inflammation, thereby influencing the development of AIH. In terms
of the mechanisms involved in immune, the gut microbiota or its
metabolites, which is decreased in secondary bile acids, short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs), and polyamines, and increased in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), tryptophan metabolite, amino
acid, and bile acid, can disrupt immune homeostasis by activating
various immune cells and immune-related signaling pathways, resulting in
aberrant activation of the immune system. Clarifying this mechanism has
significant clinical implications for the treatment of AIH with drugs
that target intestinal microbiota and related signaling pathways.
Therefore, this narrative review summarizes the progress in exploring
the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of AIH, with the
aim of helping to improve the precise targeting of therapeutic
treatments against AIH for the benefit of clinical AIH treatment.

in the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit rpn2 gene in Plasmodium
falciparum confers resistance to artemisinin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Malaria parasites increasingly develop resistance to all drugs available
in the market, hampering the goal of reducing malaria burden.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Herein, we evaluated the impact of a single-nucleotide variant, E738K,
present in the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit <italic>rpn2</italic>
gene, identified in <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> resistant
parasites. Plasmids carrying a functional <italic>rpn2</italic>
interspecies chimeric gene with 5’ recombination region from <italic>P.
falciparum</italic> and 3’ from <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> were
constructed and transfected into Dd2 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>
parasites.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results and discussion
</title>
<p>
The 738K variant parasite line presented increased parasite survival
when subjected to dihydroartemisinin (DHA), as well as increased
chymotrypsin-like activity and decreased accumulation of
polyubiquitinated proteins. We thus conclude that the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, including the 738K variant, play an
important role in parasite response to DHA, being the first report of a
mutation in a potential DHA drug target enhancing parasite survival and
contributing to a significant advance in the understanding the biology
of artemisinin resistance.

the relationship between intestinal microbiota and immune checkpoint
inhibitors in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: insights from
the “lung and large intestine stand in exterior-interior relationship”
theory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
This study is aim to discern the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
syndrome classifications relevant to immunotherapy sensitive in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and to delineate intestinal
microbiota biomarkers and impact that wield influence over the efficacy
of NSCLC immunotherapy, grounded in the TCM theory of “lung and large
intestine stand in exterior-interior relationship.”
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The study cohort consisted of patients with advanced NSCLC who received
treatment at the Oncology Department of Chengdu Fifth People’s Hospital.
These patients were categorized into distinct TCM syndrome types and
subsequently administered immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),
specifically PD-1 inhibitors. Stool specimens were collected from
patients both prior to and following treatment. To scrutinize the
differences in microbial gene sequences and species of the intestinal
microbiota, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing technology was employed.
Additionally, peripheral blood samples were collected, and the analysis
encompassed the assessment of T lymphocyte subsets and myeloid
suppressor cell subsets via flow cytometry. Subsequently, alterations in
the immune microenvironment pre- and post-treatment were thoroughly
analyzed.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The predominant clinical manifestations of advanced NSCLC patients
encompassed spleen-lung Qi deficiency syndrome and Qi-Yin deficiency
syndrome. Notably, the latter exhibited enhanced responsiveness to ICIs
with a discernible amelioration of the immune microenvironment.
Following ICIs treatment, significant variations in microbial abundance
were identified among the three strains: Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae,
and Lachnospirales, with a mutual dependency relationship. In the subset
of patients manifesting positive PD-L1 expression and enduring
therapeutic benefits, the study recorded marked increases in the ratios
of CD3<sup>+</sup>%, CD4<sup>+</sup>%, and
CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> within the T lymphocyte subsets.
Conversely, reductions were observed in the ratios of CD8%,
Treg/CD4<sup>+</sup>, M-MDSC/MDSC, and G-MDSC/MDSC.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The strains Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, and Lachnospirales emerge as
potential biomarkers denoting the composition of the intestinal
microbiota in the NSCLC therapy. The immunotherapy efficacy of ICIs
markedly accentuates in patients displaying durable treatment benefits
and those expressing positive PD-L1.

Bacteroides, and Veillonella: emerging protectors against Graves’
disease</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Graves’ disease (GD) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, and
its pathogenesis remains incompletely elucidated. Numerous studies have
implicated the gut microbiota in the development of thyroid disorders.
This study employs Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the
characteristics of gut microbiota in GD patients, aiming to offer novel
insights into the etiology and treatment of Graves’ disease.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to assess
the causal relationship between Graves’ disease and the gut microbiota
composition. Gut microbiota data were sourced from the international
consortium MiBioGen, while Graves’ disease data were obtained from
FINNGEN. Eligible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected
as instrumental variables. Multiple analysis methods, including inverse
variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted
mode, and MR-RAPS, were utilized. Sensitivity analyses were conducted
employing MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran’s Q test, and leave-one-out
analysis as quality control measures.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The Mendelian randomization study conducted in a European population
revealed a decreased risk of Graves’ disease associated with
<italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> (Odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence
interval (CI)]: 0.89 [0.89 ~ 0.90], adjusted <italic>P</italic> value:
&lt;0.001), <italic>Bacteroides</italic> (OR: [95% CI]: 0.555 [0.437 ~
0.706], adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: &lt;0.001), and
<italic>Veillonella</italic> (OR [95% CI]: 0.632 [0.492 ~ 0.811],
adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: 0.016). No significant evidence of
heterogeneity, or horizontal pleiotropy was detected. Furthermore, the
preliminary MR analysis identified 13 bacterial species including
<italic>Eubacterium brachy</italic> group and <italic>Family XIII
AD3011</italic> group, exhibiting significant associations with Graves’
disease onset, suggesting potential causal effects.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
A causal relationship exists between gut microbiota and Graves’ disease.
<italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, and
<italic>Veillonella</italic> emerge as protective factors against
Graves’ disease development. Prospective probiotic supplementation may
offer a novel avenue for adjunctive treatment in the management of
Graves’ disease in the future.

immunotherapeutic targets for treating candidiasis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
In the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in
invasive fungal infections, which has corresponded with the expanding
population of individuals with compromised immune systems. As a result,
the mortality rate linked to these infections remains unacceptably high.
The currently available antifungal drugs, such as azoles, polyenes, and
echinocandins, face limitations in terms of their diversity, the
escalating resistance of fungi and the occurrence of significant adverse
effects. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop new antifungal
medications. Vaccines and antibodies present a promising avenue for
addressing fungal infections due to their targeted antifungal properties
and ability to modulate the immune response. This review investigates
the structure and function of cell wall proteins, secreted proteins, and
functional proteins within <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Furthermore, it
seeks to analyze the current advancements and challenges in
macromolecular drugs to identify new targets for the effective
management of candidiasis.

Introduction
</title>
<p>
Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)
pose a significant threat, leading to severe morbidity and mortality
among newborns.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study, conducted at Franceville hospital’s maternity and
neonatology wards from February 22nd to June 20th, 2022, investigated
the prevalence of CPE in 197 parturients and 203 newborns. Rectal swabs
were taken from parturients before delivery and from newborns 30 minutes
after birth. Blood culture samples were collected if signs of infection
were observed in newborns during a 28-day follow-up. A total of 152
environmental samples were obtained, comprising 18 from sinks, 14 from
incubators, 27 from cradles, 39 from maternal beds, 14 from tables and
desks, four from the two baby scales and 36 from bedside furniture.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
None of the 203 newborns were found to be CPE carriers 30 minutes after
delivery. CPE carriage was found in 4.6% of mothers. When comparing
colonized and uncolonized parturients, well-established risk factors for
CPE carriage, such as recent hospitalization and antibiotic therapy,
were more frequently observed among CPE carriers (33.3 vs 10.6% for
hospitalization in the past 15 days; 55.5 vs 30.3% for hospitalization
during pregnancy, and 55.5 vs 35.1% for antibiotic therapy during
pregnancy). Notably, the prevalence of treatment with amoxicillin and
clavulanic acid was 44.4% in CPE carriers compared to 17.0% in
non-carriers. The incidence density of CPE-associated bloodstream
infection was 0.49 per 100 newborns, accounting for a fatal case of
CPE-associated bacteremia identified in one of the 203 newborns. Seven
environmental samples returned positive for CPE (5 sinks and two pieces
of furniture). Whole genome sequencing, performed on the 25 CPE
isolates, revealed isolates carrying blaNDM-7 (n=10), blaNDM-5 (n=3),
blaOXA181 (n=10), blaOXA48 (n=2) or blaOXA244 (n=1), along with genetic
traits associated with the ability to cause severe and
difficult-to-treat infections in newborns. Core genome comparison
revealed nine CPE belonging to three international high-risk clones: E.
coli ST410 (four mothers and a sink), two E. coli ST167 (a mother and a
piece of furniture), and K. pneumoniae ST307 (a sink and a piece of
furniture), with highly similar genetic backgrounds shared by maternal
and environmental isolates, suggesting maternal contamination
originating from the environment.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Our study reveals key findings may guide the implementation of infection
control measures to prevent nosocomial infections in newborns: the
prevalence of CPE carriage in one out of 20 parturients, an infection
occurring in one out of 400 newborns, substantial contamination of the
care environment, clinical and environmental CPE isolates possessing
genetic traits associated with the ability to cause severe and
challenging infections, and clonal relationships between clinical and
environmental isolates suggesting CPE spread within the wards, likely
contributing to the acquisition and colonization of CPE by parturients
during pregnancy.

<sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
Human identical sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) promoted the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) progression by upregulating hyaluronic acid (HA) via
NamiRNA-enhancer network, based on previous experimental research. This
study aimed to investigate the predictive value of HA for the severity
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the post-COVID-19 era.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A total of 217 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at
Beijing Ditan Hospital between July 2023 and October 2023. HA levels
were analyzed using biochemical detector. Logistic regression analysis
was used to screen independent factors for severe COVID-19. The
predictive performance of HA for severe infection was assessed by ROC
curve. Furthermore, the relationship between HA levels and COVID-19
severity was investigated using multivariate logistic regression models
after adjustment for potential confounders.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
According to the cut-off value of HA, COVID-19 patients were divided
into HA &lt; 90 ng/mL group (80 cases) and HA ≥ 90 ng/mL group (137
cases). High HA levels were positively associated with the severe
SARS-CoV-2 infection, including elevated inflammatory indicators, severe
lung involvement, prolonged clinical course, and higher incidence of
respiratory failure and death (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression
analysis suggested that HA was an independent predictor of severe
COVID-19 (OR = 4.540, 95% CI = 2.105-9.790, P &lt; 0.001). ROC curve
analysis showed that the AUC of HA for severe infection was 0.724. HA
levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 cases compared to the
healthy population (123.9 (82.6, 174.1) vs. 50.5 (37.8, 66.8), P &lt;
0.001), but similar to those with non-SARS-CoV-2 lung infection (121.6
(78.5, 175.6) vs. 106.0 (66.5, 149.7), P = 0.244). We also found that
the first COVID-19 infections had higher HA levels (118.8 (79.5, 174.3)
vs. 85.0 (61.1, 128.8), P &lt; 0.001) and a higher proportion of severe
infection (37.1% vs. 21.3%, P = 0.043) than re-infections. However, HA
expression failed to fully return to normal levels with infection
recovery (204.7 (152.9, 242.2) vs. 97.0 (69.3, 137.3), P &lt; 0.001).
</p>

<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
HA was associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and could be used as
a novel serum biomarker to predict the risk of COVID-19 progression in
the post-COVID-19 era.

recovery of intestinal barrier function and changes in oral microbiota
after radiation therapy injury</h2>

Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignant tumor, and
neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy is usually recommended for advanced stage
colorectal cancer. Radiotherapy can cause damage to intestinal mucosal
barrier, which may be related to perioperative complications. Intestinal
microbiota is one of the constituents of the intestinal mucosal
biological barrier, and literature reports that patients with CRC have
changes in corresponding oral microbiota. This study aims to analyze the
levels of immunoglobulin SIgA, inflammatory factors, lymphocyte subsets
quantity, and proportion in surgical specimens of intestinal mucosa at
different time intervals after radiotherapy, in order to seek
investigation for the optimal surgical time after radiotherapy and to
provide evidence for finding probiotics or immunomodulators through
high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16s rRNA in patients’ saliva
microbiota. Ultimately, this may provide new ideas for reducing
perioperative complications caused by radiotherapy-induced intestinal
damage.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We selected intestinal mucosal tissue and saliva samples from over 40
patients in our center who did not undergo radiotherapy and underwent
surgery at different time intervals after radiotherapy. Detection of
SIgA was performed using ELISA assay. Western Blotting was used to
detect IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 in the intestinal mucosal tissue. Flow
cytometry was used to detect CD4 and CD8. And the microbial community
changes in saliva samples were detected through 16s rRNA sequencing.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
After radiotherapy, changes in SIgA, various cytokines, CD4CD8
lymphocyte subsets, and oral microbiota in the intestinal mucosal tissue
of rectal cancer patients may occur. Over time, this change may
gradually recover.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
In colorectal cancer, oncological aspects often receive more attention,
while studies focusing on the intestinal mucosal barrier are less
common. This study aims to understand the repair mechanisms of the
intestinal mucosal barrier and reduce complications arising from
radiotherapy-induced damage. The relationship between oral microbiota
and systemic diseases has gained interest in recent years. However, the
literature on the oral microbiota after radiotherapy for rectal cancer
remains scarce. This study addresses this gap by analysing changes in
the salivary microbiota of rectal cancer patients before and after
radiotherapy, shedding light on microbiota changes. It aims to lay the
groundwork for identifying suitable probiotics or immunomodulators to
alleviate perioperative complications and improve the prognosis of CRC.

baseline transcriptional features and information from single-cell data
to power the prediction of influenza vaccine response</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Vaccination is still the primary means for preventing influenza virus
infection, but the protective effects vary greatly among individuals.
Identifying individuals at risk of low response to influenza vaccination
is important. This study aimed to explore improved strategies for
constructing predictive models of influenza vaccine response using gene
expression data.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We first used gene expression and immune response data from the Immune
Signatures Data Resource (IS2) to define influenza vaccine
response-related transcriptional expression and alteration features at
different time points across vaccination via differential expression
analysis. Then, we mapped these features to single-cell resolution using
additional published single-cell data to investigate the possible
mechanism. Finally, we explored the potential of these identified
transcriptional features in predicting influenza vaccine response. We
used several modeling strategies and also attempted to leverage the
information from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to optimize
the predictive models.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The results showed that models based on genes showing differential
expression (DEGs) or fold change (DFGs) at day 7 post-vaccination
performed the best in internal validation, while models based on DFGs
had a better performance in external validation than those based on
DEGs. In addition, incorporating baseline predictors could improve the
performance of models based on days 1–3, while the model based on the
expression profile of plasma cells deconvoluted from the model that used
DEGs at day 7 as predictors showed an improved performance in external
validation.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study emphasizes the value of using combination modeling strategy
and leveraging information from single-cell levels in constructing
influenza vaccine response predictive models.

activity as modulative association between Parkinson’s disease and
periodontitis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
The association between periodontitis (PD) and Parkinson’s disease (PK)
is discussed due to the inflammatory component of neurodegenerative
processes. PK severity and affected areas were determined using the
following neuropsychological tests: Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Score (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr; non-motoric symptoms by Non-Motor
Symptoms Scale (NMSS), and cognitive involvement by Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE). Neuroinflammation and the resulting
Glucose-6-Phosphatase-Dehydrogenase (G6PD) dysfunction are part of the
pathophysiology of PK. This study aimed to evaluate these associations
in periodontal inflammation. Clinical data and saliva-, serum-, and
RNA-biobank samples of 50 well-characterized diametric patients with PK
and five age- and sex-matched neurologically healthy participants were
analyzed for G6PD function, periodontal pathogens
(<italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas
gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Prevotella
intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>, and
<italic>Filifactor alocis)</italic>, monocyte chemoattractant protein
(MCP) 1, and interleukin (IL) 1-beta. Regression analysis was used to
identify associations between clinical and behavioral data, and t-tests
were used to compare health and disease. Compared with PK, no pathogens
and lower inflammatory markers (p &lt; 0.001) were detectible in healthy
saliva and serum, PK-severity/UPDRS interrelated with the occurrence of
<italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> in serum as well as IL1-beta
levels in serum and saliva (p = 0.006, 0.019, 0.034), Hoehn and Yahr
correlated with <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>,
<italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic>, RNA IL1-beta regulation, serum,
and saliva IL1-beta levels, with p-values of 0.038, 0.011, 0.008,
&lt;0.001, and 0.010, while MMSE was associated with
<italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>,
<italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>, serum MCP 1 levels, RNA
IL1-beta regulation and G6PD serum activity (p = 0.036, 0.003, 0.045,
&lt;0.001, and 0.021). Cognitive and motor skills seem to be important
as representative tests are associated with periodontal pathogens and
oral/general inflammation, wherein G6PD-saliva dysfunction might be
involved.

pancreatic cancer cohorts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer, with a 5-year overall
survival rate of 11%. Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed with
advanced stage by the time they present with symptoms. In the past
decade, microbiome studies have explored the association of pancreatic
cancer with the human oral and gut microbiomes. However, the gut
microbial antibiotic resistance genes profiling of pancreatic cancer
patients was never reported compared to that of the healthy cohort.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
In this study, we addressed the gut microbial antibiotic resistance
genes profile using the metagenomic data from two online public
pancreatic cancer cohorts. We found a high degree of data concordance
between the two cohorts, which can therefore be used for cross-sectional
comparisons. Meanwhile, we used two strategies to predict antibiotic
resistance genes and compared the advantages and disadvantages of these
two approaches. We also constructed microbe-antibiotic resistance gene
networks and found that most of the hub nodes in the networks were
antibiotic resistance genes.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
In summary, we describe the panorama of antibiotic resistance genes in
the gut microbes of patients with pancreatic cancer. We hope that our
study will provide new perspectives on treatment options for the
disease.

dynamics of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Ningbo, China: an
epidemiological and genomic analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Tuberculosis (TB), particularly drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), remains a
significant public health concern in Ningbo, China. Understanding its
molecular epidemiology and spatial distribution is paramount for
effective control.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
From December 24, 2020, to March 12, 2023, we collected clinical
<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) strains in Ningbo,
with whole-genome sequencing performed on 130 MTB strains. We analyzed
DR-related gene mutations, conducted phylogenetic and phylodynamic
analyses, identified recent transmission clusters, and assessed spatial
distribution.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Among 130 DR-TB cases, 41% were MDR-TB, 36% pre-XDR-TB, 19% RR-TB, and
3% HR-TB. The phylogenetic tree showed that 90% of strains were Lineage
2 (Beijing genotype), while remaining 10% were Lineage 4 (Euro-American
genotype). The spatial analysis identified hotspots of DR-TB in Ningbo’s
northern region, particularly in traditional urban centers. 31 (24%) of
the DR-TB cases were grouped into 7 recent transmission clusters with a
large outbreak cluster containing 15 pre-XDR-TB patients.
Epidemiological analyses suggested a higher risk of recent DR-TB
transmission among young adult patients who frequently visited Internet
cafes, game rooms, and factories.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study provides comprehensive insights into the epidemiology and
genetics of DR-TB in Ningbo. The presence of genomic clusters highlights
recent transmission events, indicating the need for targeted
interventions. These findings are vital for informing TB control
strategies in Ningbo and similar settings.

of post-weaning pig microbiome structure and functionality by in-feed
zinc oxide and antibiotics use</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) is a multifactorial disease that affects
piglets after weaning, contributing to productive and economic losses.
Its control includes the use of in-feed prophylactic antibiotics and
therapeutic zinc oxide (ZnO), treatments that, since 2022, are no longer
permitted in the European Union due to spread of antimicrobial
resistance genes and pollution of soil with heavy metals. A dysbiosis in
the microbiota has been suggested as a potential risk factor of PWD
onset. Understanding pig’s microbiota development around weaning and its
changes in response to ZnO and antibiotics is crucial to develop
feasible alternatives to prophylactic and metaphylactic antimicrobial
use.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to investigate the
environmental and faecal microbiota on 10 farms using (Treated) or not
using (ZnO-free) in-feed antibiotics and ZnO during the first 14 days
post-weaning (dpw). Environmental samples from clean pens were collected
at weaning day (0dpw), and faecal samples at 0, 7 and 14dpw. Diarrhoeic
faecal samples were collected at 7dpw when available.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The analysis of data revealed that the faecal microbiota composition and
its functionality was impacted by the sampling time point (microbiota
maturation after weaning) but not by the farm environment. Treatment
with antibiotics and ZnO showed no effects on diversity indices while
the analyses of microbiota taxonomic and functional profiles revealed
increased abundance of taxa and metabolic functions associated with
<italic>Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens</italic> or different
species of <italic>Prevotella spp</italic>. on the Treated farms, and
with <italic>Megasphaera elsdenii</italic> and <italic>Escherichia
coli</italic> on the ZnO-free farms. The analysis of diarrhoea samples
revealed that the treatment favoured the microbiota transition or
maturation from 0dpw to 14dpw in Treated farms, resembling the
composition of healthy animals, when compared to diarrhoea from ZnO-free
farms, which were linked in composition to 0dpw samples.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
The results provide a comprehensive overview of the beneficial effects
of ZnO and antibiotics in PWD in the microbiota transition after
weaning, preventing the overgrowth of pathogens such as pathogenic
<italic>E. coli</italic> and revealing the key aspects in microbiota
maturation that antibiotics or ZnO alternatives should fulfil.

<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a crucial virulence factor in the
nosocomial pathogen <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>. However,
its association with drug resistance is less well known. Notably, the
roles that different T6SS components play in the process of
antimicrobial resistance, as well as in virulence, have not been
systematically revealed.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The importance of three representative T6SS core genes involved in the
drug resistance and virulence of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, namely,
<italic>tssB</italic>, <italic>tssD</italic> (<italic>hcp</italic>), and
<italic>tssM</italic> was elucidated.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A higher ratio of the three core genes was detected in drug-resistant
strains than in susceptible strains among our 114 <italic>A.
baumannii</italic> clinical isolates. Upon deletion of
<italic>tssB</italic> in AB795639, increased antimicrobial resistance to
cefuroxime and ceftriaxone was observed, alongside reduced resistance to
gentamicin. The Δ<italic>tssD</italic> mutant showed decreased
resistance to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, and
doxycycline, but increased resistance to tobramycin and streptomycin.
The <italic>tssM</italic>-lacking mutant showed an increased sensitivity
to ofloxacin, polymyxin B, and furazolidone. In addition, a significant
reduction in biofilm formation was observed only with the
Δ<italic>tssM</italic> mutant. Moreover, the Δ<italic>tssM</italic>
strain, followed by the Δ<italic>tssD</italic> mutant, showed decreased
survival in human serum, with attenuated competition with
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and impaired lethality in
<italic>Galleria mellonella</italic>.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
The above results suggest that T6SS plays an important role,
participating in the antibiotic resistance of <italic>A.
baumannii</italic>, especially in terms of intrinsic resistance.
Meanwhile, <italic>tssM</italic> and <italic>tssD</italic> contribute to
bacterial virulence to a greater degree, with tssM being associated with
greater importance.

<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
The impact of various fatty acid types on adaptive immunity remains
uncertain, and their roles remain unelucidated. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase
(Scd) is a Δ-9 desaturase, which is a key rate-limiting enzyme for the
conversion of saturated fatty acids (SFA) to monounsaturated fatty acids
(MUFA) in the fatty acid de novo synthesis. Scd-1 converts stearic acid
(SA) and palmitic acid (PA) to oleic acid (OA) and palmitoleic acid
(PO), respectively. In this study, through a series of experiments, we
showed that Scd-1 and its resulting compound, OA, have a substantial
impact on the transformation of CD8+ naïve T cells into effector T
cells. Inactivation of Scd-1 triggers the specialization of CD8+ T cells
into the Teff subset, enhancing the effector function and mitochondrial
metabolism of Teff cells, and OA can partially counteract this. A deeper
understanding of lipid metabolism in immune cells and its impact on cell
function can lead to new therapeutic approaches for controlling the
immune response and improving prognosis.

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The etiology of Escherichia coli in yaks, along with its drug
resistance, results in economic losses within the yak breeding industry.
The utilization of lactic acid bacteria treatment has emerged as a
viable alternative to antibiotics in managing colibacillosis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
To elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of Lactobacillus against
Escherichia coli-induced intestinal barrier damage in yaks, we employed
yak epithelial cells as the experimental model and established a
monolayer epithelial barrier using Transwell. The study encompassed four
groups: a control group, a model group (exposed to E. coli O78), a
low-dose Lactobacillus group (<italic>E. coli</italic> O78 + 1 ×
10<sup>5</sup>CFU LAB), and a high-dose Lactobacillus group (<italic>E.
coli</italic> O78 + 1 × 10<sup>7</sup>CFU LAB). Various techniques,
including transmembrane resistance measurement, CFU counting, RT-qPCR,
and Western Blot, were employed to assess indicators related to cell
barrier permeability and tight junction integrity.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
In the Model group, Escherichia coli O78 significantly compromised the
permeability and tight junction integrity of the yak epithelial barrier.
It resulted in decreased transmembrane resistance, elevated FD4 flux,
and bacterial translocation. Furthermore, it downregulated the mRNA and
protein expression of MUC2, Occludin, and ZO-1, while upregulating the
mRNA expression and protein expression of FABP2 and Zonulin, thereby
impairing intestinal barrier function. Contrastingly, Lactobacillus
exhibited a remarkable protective effect. It substantially increased
transmembrane resistance, mitigated FD4 flux, and reduced bacterial
translocation. Moreover, it significantly upregulated the mRNA and
protein expression of MUC2, Occludin, and ZO-1, while downregulating the
mRNA and protein expression of FABP2 and Zonulin. Notably, high-dose LAB
demonstrated superior regulatory effects compared to the low-dose LAB
group.

Discussion
</title>
<p>
In conclusion, our findings suggest that Lactobacillus holds promise in
treating yak colibacillosis by enhancing mucin and tight junction
protein expression. Furthermore, we propose that Lactobacillus achieves
these effects through the regulation of Zonulin.

of nucleotide MALDI-TOF-MS for the identification of Mycobacterium
species</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
The accurate identification of the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>
tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and different nontuberculous mycobacteria
(NTM) species is crucial for the timely diagnosis of NTM infections and
for reducing poor prognoses. Nucleotide matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)
has been extensively used for microbial identification with high
accuracy and throughput. However, its efficacy for
<italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species identification has been less
studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of
nucleotide MALDI-TOF-MS for <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species
identification.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A total of 933 clinical <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> isolates were
preliminarily identified as NTM by the MPB64 test. These isolates were
identified by nucleotide MALDI-TOF-MS and Sanger sequencing. The
performance of nucleotide MALDI-TOF MS for identifying various
<italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species was analyzed based on Sanger
sequencing as the gold standard.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The total correct detection rate of all 933 clinical
<italic>Mycobacterium</italic> isolates using nucleotide MALDI-TOF-MS
was 91.64% (855/933), and mixed infections were detected in 18.65%
(174/933) of the samples. The correct detection rates for
<italic>Mycobacterium intracellulare</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium
abscessus</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium kansasii</italic>,
<italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic>, MTBC, <italic>Mycobacterium
gordonae</italic>, and <italic>Mycobacterium massiliense</italic> were
99.32% (585/589), 100% (86/86), 98.46% (64/65), 94.59% (35/37), 100.00%
(34/34), 95.65% (22/23), and 100% (19/19), respectively. For the
identification of the MTBC, <italic>M. intracellulare</italic>,
<italic>M. abscessus</italic>, <italic>M. kansasii</italic>, <italic>M.
avium</italic>, <italic>M. gordonae</italic>, and <italic>M.
massiliense</italic>, nucleotide MALDI-TOF-MS and Sanger sequencing
results were in good agreement (<italic>k</italic> &gt; 0.7).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
In conclusion, nucleotide MALDI-TOF-MS is a promising approach for
identifying MTBC and the most common clinical NTM species.

regulation of HERV activation in tumors and implications for
translational research in oncology</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Transcription of distinct loci of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs)
and in some cases, translation of these transcripts have been
consistently observed in many types of cancer. It is still debated
whether HERV activation serves as a trigger for carcinogenesis or rather
occurs as a consequence of epigenetic alterations and other molecular
sequelae that characterize cellular transformation. Here we review the
known molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of HERV activation in cancer
cells as well as its potential contribution to carcinogenesis. Further,
we describe the use of HERV expression in cancer diagnostic and
characterize the potential of HERV-derived antigens to serve as novel
targets for cancer immunotherapy. We believe this review, which
summarizes both what is known as well as unknown in this rapidly
developing field, will boost interest in research on the therapeutic
potential of targeting HERV elements in tumors and the impact of HERV
activation in oncogenesis.

of AI-2/LuxS quorum sensing system in biofilm formation, pathogenesis of
Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus</italic> (SEZ) is an
opportunistic pathogen of both humans and animals. Quorum sensing (QS)
plays an important role in the regulation of bacterial group behaviors.
The aim of this study was to characterize the LuxS in SEZ and evaluate
its impact on biofilm formation, pathogenesis and gene expression. The
wild-type SEZ and its LuxS mutant (Δ<italic>luxS</italic>) were examined
for growth, biofilm formation, virulence factors, and transcriptomic
profiles. Our results showed that LuxS deficiency did not affect SEZ
hemolytic activity, adhesion or capsule production. For biofilm assay
demonstrated that mutation in the <italic>luxS</italic> gene
significantly enhances biofilm formation, produced a denser biofilm and
attached to a glass surface. RAW264.7 cell infection indicated that
Δ<italic>luxS</italic> promoted macrophage apoptosis and
pro-inflammatory responses. In mice infection, there was no significant
difference in mortality between SEZ and Δ<italic>luxS</italic>. However,
the bacterial load in the spleen of mice infected with
Δ<italic>luxS</italic> was significantly higher than in those infected
with SEZ. And the pathological analysis further indicated that spleen
damage was more severe in the Δ<italic>luxS</italic> group. Moreover,
transcriptomics analysis revealed significant alterations in carbon
metabolism, RNA binding and stress response genes in
Δ<italic>luxS</italic>. In summary, this study provides the first
evidence of AI-2/LuxS QS system in SEZ and reveals its regulatory
effects on biofilm formation, pathogenicity and gene expression.

risk evaluation of transfusion blood containing low-density Babesia
microti</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
<italic>Babesia</italic> is a unique apicomplexan parasite that
specifically invades and proliferates in red blood cells and can be
transmitted via blood transfusion, resulting in transfusion-transmitted
babesiosis. However, detecting <italic>Babesia</italic> in blood before
transfusion has not received enough attention, and the risk of
transfusing blood containing a low density of <italic>Babesia
microti</italic> (<italic>B. microti</italic>) is unclear, possibly
threatening public health and wellness.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Purpose
</title>
<p>
This study aimed to determine the lower detection limit of <italic>B.
microti</italic> in blood and to evaluate the transmission risk of blood
transfusion containing low-density <italic>B. microti</italic>.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Infected BALB/c mouse models were established by transfusing infected
whole blood with different infection rates and densities of <italic>B.
microti</italic>. Microscopic examination, nested Polymerase Chain
Reaction (nested PCR), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
were used to evaluate the infection status of the mouse models.
Meanwhile, the nested PCR detection limit of <italic>B. microti</italic>
was obtained using pure <italic>B. microti</italic> DNA samples with
serial concentrations and whole blood samples with different densities
of <italic>B. microti</italic>-infected red blood cells. Thereafter,
whole mouse blood with a <italic>B. microti</italic> density lower than
that of the nested PCR detection limit and human blood samples infected
with <italic>B. microti</italic> were transfused into healthy mice to
assess the transmission risk in mouse models. The infection status of
these mice was evaluated through microscopic examination, nested PCR
tests, and ELISA.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The mice inoculated with different densities of <italic>B.
microti</italic> reached the peak infection rate on different days.
Overall, the higher the blood <italic>B. microti</italic> density was,
the earlier the peak infection rate was reached. The levels of specific
antibodies against <italic>B. microti</italic> in the blood of the
infected mice increased sharply during the first 30 days of infection,
reaching a peak level at 60 days post-infection, and maintaining a high
level thereafter. The nested PCR detection limits of <italic>B.
microti</italic> DNA and parasite density were 3 fg and 5.48
parasites/μL, respectively. The whole blood containing an extremely low
density of <italic>B. microti</italic> and human blood samples infected
with <italic>B. microti</italic> could infect mice, confirming the
transmission risk of transfusing blood with low-density <italic>B.
microti</italic>.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Whole blood containing extremely low density of <italic>B.
microti</italic> poses a high transmission risk when transfused between
mice and mice or human and mice, suggesting that
<italic>Babesia</italic> detection should be considered by governments,
hospitals, and disease prevention and control centers as a mandatory
test before blood donation or transfusion.

infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) review by continent</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded,
enveloped RNA virus responsible for substantial economic losses to the
poultry industry worldwide by causing a highly contagious respiratory
disease. The virus can spread quickly through contact, contaminated
equipment, aerosols, and personal-to-person contact. We highlight the
prevalence and geographic distribution of all nine genotypes, as well as
the relevant symptoms and economic impact, by extensively analyzing the
current literature. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis was performed using
Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA-6), which provided
insights into the global molecular diversity and evolution of IBV
strains. This review highlights that IBV genotype I (GI) is prevalent
worldwide because sporadic cases have been found on many continents.
Conversely, GII was identified as a European strain that subsequently
dispersed throughout Europe and South America. GIII and GV are
predominant in Australia, with very few reports from Asia. GIV, GVIII,
and GIX originate from North America. GIV was found to circulate in
Asia, and GVII was identified in Europe and China. Geographically, the
GVI-1 lineage is thought to be restricted to Asia. This review
highlights that IBV still often arises in commercial chicken flocks
despite immunization and biosecurity measures because of the ongoing
introduction of novel IBV variants and inadequate cross-protection
provided by the presently available vaccines. Consequently, IB
consistently jeopardizes the ability of the poultry industry to grow and
prosper. Identifying these domains will aid in discerning the
pathogenicity and prevalence of IBV genotypes, potentially enhancing
disease prevention and management tactics.

responses versus virus-induced cellular shutoff: a game of thrones
between influenza A virus NS1 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Following virus recognition of host cell receptors and viral
particle/genome internalization, viruses replicate in the host via
hijacking essential host cell machinery components to evade the provoked
antiviral innate immunity against the invading pathogen. Respiratory
viral infections are usually acute with the ability to activate pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) in/on host cells, resulting in the
production and release of interferons (IFNs), proinflammatory cytokines,
chemokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to reduce virus fitness and
mitigate infection. Nevertheless, the game between viruses and the host
is a complicated and dynamic process, in which they restrict each other
via specific factors to maintain their own advantages and win this game.
The primary role of the non-structural protein 1 (NS1 and Nsp1) of
influenza A viruses (IAV) and the pandemic severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respectively, is to control
antiviral host-induced innate immune responses. This review provides a
comprehensive overview of the genesis, spatial structure, viral and
cellular interactors, and the mechanisms underlying the unique
biological functions of IAV NS1 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 in infected host
cells. We also highlight the role of both non-structural proteins in
modulating viral replication and pathogenicity. Eventually, and because
of their important role during viral infection, we also describe their
promising potential as targets for antiviral therapy and the development
of live attenuated vaccines (LAV). Conclusively, both IAV NS1 and
SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 play an important role in virus–host interactions, viral
replication, and pathogenesis, and pave the way to develop novel
prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions for the treatment of these
important human respiratory viral pathogens.

the mystery: a Mendelian randomized exploration of gut microbiota and
different types of obesity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Numerous studies have demonstrated the influence of gut microbiota on
the development of obesity. In this study, we utilized Mendelian
randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the gut microbiota
characteristics among different types of obese patients, aiming to
elucidate the underlying mechanisms and provide novel insights for
obesity treatment.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was
employed to assess causal relationships between gut microbiota and
various obesity subtypes. Gut microbiota data were obtained from the
international consortium MiBioGen, and data on obese individuals were
sourced from the Finnish National Biobank FinnGen. Eligible
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental
variables. Various analytical methods, including inverse variance
weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, MR-RAPS, and Lasso
regression, were applied. Sensitivity analyses for quality control
included MR-Egger intercept tests, Cochran’s Q tests, and leave-one-out
analyses and others.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Mendelian randomization studies revealed distinct gut microbiota
profiles among European populations with different obesity subtypes.
Following multivariable MR analysis, we found that
<italic>Ruminococcaceae UCG010</italic> [<italic>Odds Ratio
(OR)</italic>: 0.842, <italic>95% confidence interval (CI)</italic>:
0.766-0.926, Adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: 0.028] independently
reduced the risk of obesity induced by excessive calorie intake, while
<italic>Butyricimonas</italic> [<italic>OR</italic>: 4.252, <italic>95%
CI</italic>: 2.177-8.307, Adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: 0.002]
independently increased the risk of medication-induced obesity. For
localized adiposity, <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic>
[<italic>OR</italic>: 0.213, <italic>95% CI</italic>: 0.115-0.395,
Adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: &lt;0.001] acted as a protective
factor. In the case of extreme obesity with alveolar hypoventilation,
<italic>lactobacillus</italic> [<italic>OR</italic>: 0.724, <italic>95%
CI</italic>: 0.609-0.860, Adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: 0.035]
reduced the risk of its occurrence. Additionally, six gut microbiota may
have potential roles in the onset of different types of obesity.
Specifically, the <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> torques group may
increase the risk of its occurrence. <italic>Desulfovibrio</italic> and
<italic>Catenabacterium</italic> may serve as protective factors in the
onset of Drug-induced obesity. <italic>Oxalobacteraceae</italic>,
<italic>Actinomycetaceae</italic>, and <italic>Ruminiclostridium
9</italic>, on the other hand, could potentially increase the risk of
Drug-induced obesity. No evidence of heterogeneity or horizontal
pleiotropy among SNPs was found in the above studies (all
<italic>P</italic> values for Q test and MR-Egger intercept &gt; 0.05).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Gut microbiota abundance is causally related to obesity, with distinct
gut microbiota profiles observed among different obesity subtypes. Four
bacterial species, including <italic>Ruminococcaceae UCG010</italic>,
<italic>Butyricimonas</italic>, <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic> and
<italic>lactobacillus</italic> independently influence the development
of various types of obesity. Probiotic and prebiotic supplementation may
represent a novel approach in future obesity management.
