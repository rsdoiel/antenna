microbial species and host bile acids biosynthesis linked to cholesterol
gallstone comparing to pigment individuals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Gallstones are crystalline deposits in the gallbladder that are
traditionally classified as cholesterol, pigment, or mixed stones based
on their composition. Microbiota and host metabolism variances among the
different types of gallstones remain largely unclear. Here, the bile and
gallstone microbial species spectra of 29 subjects with gallstone
disease (GSD, 24 cholesterol and 5 pigment) were revealed by type IIB
restriction site-associated DNA microbiome sequencing (2bRAD-M). Among
them (21 subjects: 18 cholesterol and 3 pigment), plasma samples were
subjected to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) untargeted
metabolomics. The microbiome yielded 896 species comprising 882
bacteria, 13 fungi, and 1 archaeon. Microbial profiling revealed
significant enrichment of <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> and
<italic>Microbacterium</italic> sp005774735 in gallstone and
<italic>Agrobacterium pusense</italic> and <italic>Enterovirga</italic>
sp013044135 in the bile of cholesterol GSD subjects. The metabolome
revealed 2296 metabolites, in which malvidin 3-(6’’-malonylglucoside),
2-Methylpropyl glucosinolate, and ergothioneine were markedly enriched
in cholesterol GSD subjects. Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA)
demonstrated enriched bile acids biosynthesis in individuals with
cholesterol GSD. Overall, the multi-omics analysis revealed that
microbiota and host metabolism interaction perturbations differ
depending on the disease type. Perturbed gallstone type-related
microbiota may contribute to unbalanced bile acids metabolism in the
gallbladder and host, representing a potential early diagnostic marker
and therapeutic target for GSD.

from Wuhan: two-case report and literature review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Talaromycosis is a serious opportunistic infectious disease caused by
<italic>Talaromyces marneffei</italic>, which mostly occurs in
immunocompromised patients. The disease is mainly prevalent in tropical
countries and regions of Southeast Asia and South Asia, but non-endemic
areas also have patients with Talaromycosis. The disease has no
characteristic clinical manifestations and is difficult to diagnose.
Delayed diagnosis often leads to death.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Case presentation
</title>
<p>
Both patients had cellular immunodeficiency. Case 1 had a history of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and case 2 had a history of renal
transplantation and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. They
all had fever, anemia, fatigue, and skin lesions. Case 1 had
gastrointestinal bleeding, enlarged lymph nodes, and hepatosplenomegaly.
Case 2 had cough and dyspnea. Both patients had thrombocytopenia and
hypoalbuminemia; an increased neutrophil ratio, procalcitonin, and
C-reactive protein; and abnormal liver function and coagulation
dysfunction. Case 1 sputum culture, blood culture, and bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid were positive for <italic>T. marneffei</italic>. <italic>T.
marneffei</italic> was detected in the blood culture of case 2, with
infection of <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> and
<italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic>. Chest computed tomography scan
mainly showed pulmonary exudative lesions. Although these two patients
were actively treated, they died of poor efficacy.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Talaromycosis has an insidious onset, long course, atypical clinical
symptoms, imaging performance and laboratory results, difficult
diagnosis, and high mortality. Therefore, it is important to promptly
consider and treat Talaromycosis in immunocompromised patients upon
infection in order to reduce mortality.

role of transcriptional regulators in metal ion homeostasis of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Metal ions are essential trace elements for all living organisms and
play critical catalytic, structural, and allosteric roles in many
enzymes and transcription factors. <italic>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), as an intracellular pathogen, is usually
found in host macrophages, where the bacterium can survive and
replicate. One of the reasons why Tuberculosis (TB) is so difficult to
eradicate is the continuous adaptation of its pathogen. It is capable of
adapting to a wide range of harsh environmental stresses, including
metal ion toxicity in the host macrophages. Altering the concentration
of metal ions is the common host strategy to limit MTB replication and
persistence. This review mainly focuses on transcriptional regulatory
proteins in MTB that are involved in the regulation of metal ions such
as iron, copper and zinc. The aim is to offer novel insights and
strategies for screening targets for TB treatment, as well as for the
development and design of new therapeutic interventions.

and antibiotic sensitivity of bacterial keratitis: a retrospective
analysis of eight years in a Tertiary Referral Hospital in Southwest
China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Purpose
</title>
<p>
The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiological
characteristics, distribution of isolates, prevailing patterns, and
antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial keratitis (BK) in a Tertiary
Referral Hospital located in Southwest China.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 660 cases of bacterial
keratitis occurring between January 2015 and December 2022. The
demographic data, predisposing factors, microbial findings, and
antibiotic sensitivity profiles were examined.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Corneal trauma emerged as the most prevalent predisposing factor,
accounting for 37.1% of cases. Among these cases, bacterial culture
results were positive in 318 cases, 68 species of bacteria were
identified. The most common Gram-Positive bacteria isolated overall was
the <italic>staphylococcus epidermis</italic> and the most common
Gram-Negative bacteria isolated was <italic>Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</italic>. Methicillin-Resistant
<italic>Staphylococci</italic> accounted for 18.1% of all Gram-Positive
bacteria. The detection rate of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> showed an
increasing trend over time (<italic>Rs=0.738, P=0.037</italic>). There
was a significant decrease in the percentage of Gram-Negative
microorganisms over time (<italic>Rs=0.743, P=0.035</italic>). The
sensitivity of Gram-Positive bacteria to linezolid, vancomycin,
tigecycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and rifampicin was over 98%. The
sensitivity rates of Gram-Negative bacteria to amikacin, meropenem,
piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone sodium/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and
cefepime were all above 85%. In patients with a history of vegetative
trauma, the possibility of BK should be taken into account in addition
to the focus on fungal keratitis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The microbial composition primarily consists of Gram-Positive cocci and
Gram-Negative bacilli. Among the Gram-Positive bacteria, <italic>S.
epidermidis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> are
the most frequently encountered, while <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is
the predominant Gram-Negative bacteria. To combat Gram-Positive
bacteria, vancomycin, linezolid, and rifampicin are considered excellent
antimicrobial agents. When targeting Gram-Negative pathogens,
third-generation cephalosporins exhibit superior sensitivity compared to
first and second-generation counterparts. As an initial empirical
treatment for severe cases of bacterial keratitis and those unresponsive
to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones in community settings, the
combination therapy of vancomycin and tobramycin is a justifiable
approach. Bacterial keratitis can be better managed by understanding the
local etiology and antibacterial drug susceptibility patterns.

id="pad-mediated-citrullination-is-a-novel-candidate-diagnostic-marker-and-druggable-target-for-hpv-associated-cervical-cancer">PAD-mediated
citrullination is a novel candidate diagnostic marker and druggable
target for HPV-associated cervical cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Citrullination is an emerging post-translational modification catalyzed
by peptidyl-arginine deiminases (PADs) that convert peptidyl-arginine
into peptidyl-citrulline. In humans, the PAD family consists of five
isozymes (PADs 1-4, 6) involved in multiple diseases, including cancer.
Given that high-risk (hr) human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the
etiological agents of cervical cancer, in this study, we sought to
determine whether PAD-mediated protein citrullination would play a
functional role in the HPV-driven transformation of epithelial cells.
Here we show that both total protein citrullination and PAD4 expression
levels are significantly associated with cervical cancer progression.
Specifically, epithelial immunostaining for PAD4 revealed an
increasingly higher histoscore from low-grade (CIN1) to high-grade
(CIN2, CIN3) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) lesions, raising the attractive possibility that
PAD4 may be used as tumor staging markers. Furthermore, taking advantage
of the epidermoid cervical cancer cell line CaSki, which harbors
multiple copies of the integrated HPV16 genome, we show that the
expression of E6 and E7 HPV oncoproteins is impaired by treatment with
the pharmacological pan-PAD inhibitor BB-Cl-amidine. Consistently, p53
and p21, two targets of HPV oncoproteins, are upregulated by the PAD
inhibitor, which undergoes cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Altogether,
these findings highlight a novel mechanism by which hrHPVs alter host
regulatory pathways involved in cell cycle and survival to gain viral
fitness, raising the possibility that PADs may represent an attractive
target for developing novel host-targeting antivirals effective in
preventing cervical cancer progression.
