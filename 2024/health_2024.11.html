interplay between HPV, other Sexually Transmissible Infections and
genital microbiome on cervical microenvironment (MicroCervixHPV
study)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
The importance of Cervicovaginal Microbiota in protecting against
infections (such as HPV) is already well established, namely through
Lactobacillus spp., as well as the mechanism through which HPV leads to
Cervical Neoplasia. However, it is not possible to classify HPV as a
complete carcinogen. Thus, the importance of exploring Cervicovaginal
dysbiosis with the intention of deciphering this interaction with HPV,
takes on greater relevance. The main objectives of this study were: 1)
Comparison of the MCV composition of women with or without HPV and women
with ASCUS or LSIL; 2) Characterization of cytokines present in the
vaginal microenvironment; 3) Evaluation of the blood count ratios as
prognostic systemic inflammatory biomarkers; 4) Correlation between MCV,
HPV serotypes and cytokines.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This was a retrospective, observational, multicenter, cross-sectional
study. CVM analysis was performed by isolation RNA and sequencing on a
NGS platform. Cytokine concentrations of CVM were obtained through
Multiplex platform. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS v 26.0.
An α of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Highlighting the core of the study, CVM types of CST I and CST IV were
found to influence the emergence of cervical lesions.
Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio was found to impact the prognosis of
ASCUS. Within CVM, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> prevent the growth of
other CST IV species, while the latter express symbiotic relationships
with each other and show affinity for specific HPV serotypes. At last,
RANTES chemokine is significantly elevated in cervicovaginal infections.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The importance of using vaginal cytokine profiles and CVM is highlighted
in the hypothesis of prevention of Cervical Neoplasia development, as
well as in its use as a prognostic biomarker. Taken together, these
insights are one step closer to personalized medicine.

and Toll-like receptors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Brucella</italic> consists of gram-negative bacteria that have
the ability to invade and replicate in professional and non-professional
phagocytes, and its prolonged persistence in the host leads to
brucellosis, a serious zoonosis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the
best-known sensors of microorganisms implicated in the regulation of
innate and adaptive immunity. In particular, TLRs are transmembrane
proteins with a typical structure of an extracellular leucine-rich
repeat (LRR) region and an intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
(TIR) domain. In this review, we discuss <italic>Brucella</italic>
infection and the aspects of host immune responses induced by pathogens.
Furthermore, we summarize the roles of TLRs in <italic>Brucella</italic>
infection, with substantial emphasis on the molecular insights into its
mechanisms of action.

of ticks: first molecular report of Hyalomma asiaticum and molecular
detection of tick-borne bacteria in ticks and blood from Khyber

<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Multiple ticks (Acari: Ixodoidea) carrying Rickettsiales bacteria have
significant importance for both human and animal health. Thus, the
purpose of this work was to genetically analyze tick species and their
associated Rickettsiales bacteria in animal hosts. In order to achieve
these objectives, various animals (including camels, cattle, goats,
sheep, dogs, and mice) were inspected in four districts (Mardan,
Peshawar, Kohat, and Karak) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to collect ticks,
while blood samples were collected from all the symptomatic and
asymptomatic cattle in all four districts. A total of 234 ticks were
obtained from 86 out of 143 (60.14%) host animals, which were
morphologically identified as <italic>Rhipicephalus turanicus</italic>,
<italic>Rhipicephalus microplus</italic>, <italic>Haemaphysalis
cornupunctata</italic>, and <italic>Hyalomma asiaticum</italic>. Among
these, their representative ticks (126/234, 53.85%) were processed for
molecular confirmation using cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase
(<italic>cox1</italic>) gene. Obtained <italic>cox1</italic> sequences
of four different tick species showed 99.72%–100% maximum identity with
their corresponding species reported from Pakistan, China, India, and
Kazakhstan and clustered phylogenetically. This study presented the
first genetic report of <italic>Hy. asiaticum</italic> ticks in
Pakistan. Moreover, genetically confirmed tick species were molecularly
analyzed by PCR for detection of Rickettsiales DNA using partial
fragments of <italic>16S rDNA</italic>, 190-kDa outer membrane protein A
(<italic>ompA</italic>), and 120-kDa outer membrane protein B
(<italic>ompB</italic>) genes. In addition, blood samples were analyzed
to identify Rickettsiales bacteria using the aforementioned genes.
Rickettsiales bacteria were found in 24/126 (19.05%) ticks and 4/16
(25.00%) in symptomatic cattle’s blood. The obtained
<italic>ompA</italic> and <italic>ompB</italic> sequences from
<italic>Hy. asiaticum</italic> ticks showed 99.73%–99.87% with
<italic>Candidatus Rickettsia</italic> shennongii and unidentified
<italic>Rickettsia</italic> sp., whereas the obtained <italic>16S
rDNA</italic> sequences from cattle’s blood and ticks (<italic>Hae.
cornupunctata</italic>) showed 99.67% highest identity with
<italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>. The <italic>16S
rDNA</italic> sequence of Rickettsiales DNA from <italic>Rh.
turanicus</italic> ticks showed 100% identity with <italic>Ehrlichia
canis</italic> and unidentified <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> sp. Obtained
sequences of Rickettsiales bacteria were grouped along with their
respective species in phylogenetic trees, which were previously reported
in Greece, Cuba, Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, South Korea, and China
(mainland and Taiwan). This extensive study explores the wide range of
damaging ticks and their corresponding tick-borne bacteria in the area,
suggesting a possible danger to both livestock and human communities.

id="differential-responses-to-avian-pathogenic-e.-coli-and-the-regulatory-role-of-splenic-mirnas-in-apec-infection-in-silkie-chickens">Differential
responses to avian pathogenic E. coli and the regulatory role of splenic
miRNAs in APEC infection in Silkie chickens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Avian pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (APEC) is a bacterial
disease that harms the poultry industry worldwide, but its effect on
Chinese Silkie has not been reported. Studies on whether there are
differences in Silkie individual resistance to APEC and the regulatory
role of spleen miRNAs lay the foundation for strategies against APEC.
Therefore, 270 Silkie chickens were infected with the median lethal dose
of an <italic>E. coli</italic> O1, O2, and O78 mixture. These chickens
were divided into a susceptible group (Group S) and a recovery group
(Group R) according to whether they survived 15 days postinfection
(dpi). Moreover, 90 uninfected APEC Silkie served as controls (Group C).
The splenic miRNA expression profile was examined to evaluate the role
of miRNAs in the APEC infection response. Of the 270 Silkies infected
with APEC, 144 were alive at 15 dpi. Cluster analysis and principal
component analysis (PCA) of splenic miRNAs revealed that the four Group
R replicates were clustered with the three Group C replicates and were
far from the three Group S replicates. Differentially expressed (DE)
miRNAs, especially gga-miR-146b-5p, play essential roles in immune and
inflammatory responses to APEC. Functional enrichment analyses of
DEmiRNAs suggested that suppression of immune system processes
(biological processes) might contribute to susceptibility to APEC and
that FoxO signaling pathways might be closely associated with the APEC
infection response and postinfection repair. This study paves the way
for screening anti-APEC Silkies and provides novel insights into the
regulatory role of miRNAs in APEC infection.

in gut microbiota is associated with immune imbalance in Graves’
disease</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Graves’ disease (GD), characterized by immune aberration, is associated
with gut dysbiosis. Despite the growing interest, substantial evidence
detailing the precise impact of gut microbiota on GD’s autoimmune
processes remains exceedingly rare.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
This study was designed to investigate the influence of gut microbiota
on immune dysregulation in GD.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
It encompassed 52 GD patients and 45 healthy controls (HCs), employing
flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to examine
lymphocyte and cytokine profiles, alongside lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
levels. Gut microbiota profiles and metabolic features were assessed
using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and targeted metabolomics.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our observations revealed a disturbed B-cell distribution and elevated
LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines in GD patients compared to HCs.
Significant differences in gut microbiota composition and a marked
deficit in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, including
ASV263(<italic>Bacteroides</italic>),
ASV1451(<italic>Dialister</italic>), and
ASV503(<italic>Coprococcus</italic>), were observed in GD patients.
These specific bacteria and SCFAs showed correlations with thyroid
autoantibodies, B-cell subsets, and cytokine levels. In vitro studies
further showed that LPS notably caused B-cell subsets imbalance,
reducing conventional memory B cells while increasing naïve B cells.
Additionally, acetate combined with propionate and butyrate showcased
immunoregulatory functions, diminishing cytokine production in
LPS-stimulated cells.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Overall, our results highlight the role of gut dysbiosis in contributing
to immune dysregulation in GD by affecting lymphocyte status and
cytokine production.

efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease: a
systematic review and meta-analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a liver damage disease caused by
long-term heavy drinking. Currently, there is no targeted pharmaceutical
intervention available for the treatment of this disease. To address
this, this paper evaluates the efficacy and safety of probiotic
preparation in treating ALD through conducting a meta-analysis, and
provides a valuable insight for clinical decision-making.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A systematic search was conducted across databases, including PubMed,
Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM
from the inception dates to October 15, 2023, to identify clinical
randomized controlled trials on probiotic preparations in the treatment
of ALD. After the literature underwent screening, data extraction, and
quality assessment, RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.2 were employed for data
analysis and processing.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 9 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion
criteria. The results of the meta-analysis showed that probiotic
preparation could significantly improve the liver function of patients
with alcoholic liver disease compared with the control group. Probiotic
intervention led to a significant reduction in the levels of alanine
aminotransferase
(MD=-13.36,95%CI:-15.80,-10.91;<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.00001),aspartate
aminotransferase
(MD=-16.99,95%CI:-20.38,-13.59;<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.00001),γ-glutamyl
transpeptidase (MD=-18.79,95% CI:-28.23,-9.34;
<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). Concurrently, the level of serum albumin
(MD=0.19,95% CI:0.02,0.36;<italic>P</italic>=0.03) was increased.
Furthermore, probiotic intervention could also modulate the composition
of intestinal flora in patients with alcoholic liver disease, leading to
an augmentation in <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> and a reduction in
<italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> However, in patients with alcoholic
liver disease, probiotic intervention showed no significant effects on
total bilirubin (MD=-0.01,95% CI:-0.17,0.15;<italic>P</italic>=0.91),
tumor necrosis factor-α (MD=0.03,95%
CI:-0.86,0.92;<italic>P</italic>=0.94) and interleukin-6 (MD=-5.3,95%
CI:-16.04,5.45;<italic>P</italic>=0.33).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The meta-analysis indicates that probiotics can improve liver function
in alcoholic liver disease, reduce inflammatory responses, regulate
intestinal flora, which have potential value in the treatment of
alcoholic liver disease.

ocular surface microbiota in obesity: a case-control study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Purpose
</title>
<p>
This study aimed to investigate the composition of ocular surface
microbiota in patients with obesity.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This case-control study, spanning from November 2020 to March 2021 at
Henan Provincial People’s Hospital, involved 35 patients with obesity
and an equivalent number of age and gender-matched healthy controls. By
employing 16S rRNA sequencing, this study analyzed the differences in
ocular surface microbiota between the two groups. The functional
prediction analysis of the ocular surface microbiota was conducted using
PICRUSt2.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The alpha diversity showed no notable differences in the richness or
evenness of the ocular surface microbiota when comparing patients with
obesity to healthy controls (Shannon index, <italic>P</italic>=0.1003).
However, beta diversity highlighted significant variances in the
microbiota composition of these two groups (ANOSIM,
<italic>P</italic>=0.005). LEfSe analysis revealed that the relative
abundances of <italic>Delftia</italic>, <italic>Cutibacterium</italic>,
<italic>Aquabacterium</italic>, <italic>Acidovorax</italic>,
<italic>Caulobacteraceae unclassified</italic>,
<italic>Comamonas</italic> and <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> in
patients with obesity were significantly increased
(<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Predictive analysis using PICRUSt2
highlighted a significant enhancement in certain metabolic pathways in
patients with obesity, notably xenobiotics metabolism via cytochrome
P450 (CYP450), lipid metabolism, and the oligomerization domain
(NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Patients with obesity exhibit a distinct ocular surface core microbiome.
The observed variations in this microbiome may correlate with increased
activity in CYP450, changes in lipid metabolism, and alterations in
NOD-like receptor signaling pathways.

microbial species and host bile acids biosynthesis linked to cholesterol
gallstone comparing to pigment individuals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Gallstones are crystalline deposits in the gallbladder that are
traditionally classified as cholesterol, pigment, or mixed stones based
on their composition. Microbiota and host metabolism variances among the
different types of gallstones remain largely unclear. Here, the bile and
gallstone microbial species spectra of 29 subjects with gallstone
disease (GSD, 24 cholesterol and 5 pigment) were revealed by type IIB
restriction site-associated DNA microbiome sequencing (2bRAD-M). Among
them (21 subjects: 18 cholesterol and 3 pigment), plasma samples were
subjected to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) untargeted
metabolomics. The microbiome yielded 896 species comprising 882
bacteria, 13 fungi, and 1 archaeon. Microbial profiling revealed
significant enrichment of <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> and
<italic>Microbacterium</italic> sp005774735 in gallstone and
<italic>Agrobacterium pusense</italic> and <italic>Enterovirga</italic>
sp013044135 in the bile of cholesterol GSD subjects. The metabolome
revealed 2296 metabolites, in which malvidin 3-(6’’-malonylglucoside),
2-Methylpropyl glucosinolate, and ergothioneine were markedly enriched
in cholesterol GSD subjects. Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA)
demonstrated enriched bile acids biosynthesis in individuals with
cholesterol GSD. Overall, the multi-omics analysis revealed that
microbiota and host metabolism interaction perturbations differ
depending on the disease type. Perturbed gallstone type-related
microbiota may contribute to unbalanced bile acids metabolism in the
gallbladder and host, representing a potential early diagnostic marker
and therapeutic target for GSD.

from Wuhan: two-case report and literature review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Talaromycosis is a serious opportunistic infectious disease caused by
<italic>Talaromyces marneffei</italic>, which mostly occurs in
immunocompromised patients. The disease is mainly prevalent in tropical
countries and regions of Southeast Asia and South Asia, but non-endemic
areas also have patients with Talaromycosis. The disease has no
characteristic clinical manifestations and is difficult to diagnose.
Delayed diagnosis often leads to death.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Case presentation
</title>
<p>
Both patients had cellular immunodeficiency. Case 1 had a history of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and case 2 had a history of renal
transplantation and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. They
all had fever, anemia, fatigue, and skin lesions. Case 1 had
gastrointestinal bleeding, enlarged lymph nodes, and hepatosplenomegaly.
Case 2 had cough and dyspnea. Both patients had thrombocytopenia and
hypoalbuminemia; an increased neutrophil ratio, procalcitonin, and
C-reactive protein; and abnormal liver function and coagulation
dysfunction. Case 1 sputum culture, blood culture, and bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid were positive for <italic>T. marneffei</italic>. <italic>T.
marneffei</italic> was detected in the blood culture of case 2, with
infection of <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> and
<italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic>. Chest computed tomography scan
mainly showed pulmonary exudative lesions. Although these two patients
were actively treated, they died of poor efficacy.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Talaromycosis has an insidious onset, long course, atypical clinical
symptoms, imaging performance and laboratory results, difficult
diagnosis, and high mortality. Therefore, it is important to promptly
consider and treat Talaromycosis in immunocompromised patients upon
infection in order to reduce mortality.

role of transcriptional regulators in metal ion homeostasis of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Metal ions are essential trace elements for all living organisms and
play critical catalytic, structural, and allosteric roles in many
enzymes and transcription factors. <italic>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), as an intracellular pathogen, is usually
found in host macrophages, where the bacterium can survive and
replicate. One of the reasons why Tuberculosis (TB) is so difficult to
eradicate is the continuous adaptation of its pathogen. It is capable of
adapting to a wide range of harsh environmental stresses, including
metal ion toxicity in the host macrophages. Altering the concentration
of metal ions is the common host strategy to limit MTB replication and
persistence. This review mainly focuses on transcriptional regulatory
proteins in MTB that are involved in the regulation of metal ions such
as iron, copper and zinc. The aim is to offer novel insights and
strategies for screening targets for TB treatment, as well as for the
development and design of new therapeutic interventions.

and antibiotic sensitivity of bacterial keratitis: a retrospective
analysis of eight years in a Tertiary Referral Hospital in Southwest
China</h2>

Purpose
</title>
<p>
The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiological
characteristics, distribution of isolates, prevailing patterns, and
antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial keratitis (BK) in a Tertiary
Referral Hospital located in Southwest China.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 660 cases of bacterial
keratitis occurring between January 2015 and December 2022. The
demographic data, predisposing factors, microbial findings, and
antibiotic sensitivity profiles were examined.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Corneal trauma emerged as the most prevalent predisposing factor,
accounting for 37.1% of cases. Among these cases, bacterial culture
results were positive in 318 cases, 68 species of bacteria were
identified. The most common Gram-Positive bacteria isolated overall was
the <italic>staphylococcus epidermis</italic> and the most common
Gram-Negative bacteria isolated was <italic>Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</italic>. Methicillin-Resistant
<italic>Staphylococci</italic> accounted for 18.1% of all Gram-Positive
bacteria. The detection rate of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> showed an
increasing trend over time (<italic>Rs=0.738, P=0.037</italic>). There
was a significant decrease in the percentage of Gram-Negative
microorganisms over time (<italic>Rs=0.743, P=0.035</italic>). The
sensitivity of Gram-Positive bacteria to linezolid, vancomycin,
tigecycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and rifampicin was over 98%. The
sensitivity rates of Gram-Negative bacteria to amikacin, meropenem,
piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone sodium/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and
cefepime were all above 85%. In patients with a history of vegetative
trauma, the possibility of BK should be taken into account in addition
to the focus on fungal keratitis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The microbial composition primarily consists of Gram-Positive cocci and
Gram-Negative bacilli. Among the Gram-Positive bacteria, <italic>S.
epidermidis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> are
the most frequently encountered, while <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is
the predominant Gram-Negative bacteria. To combat Gram-Positive
bacteria, vancomycin, linezolid, and rifampicin are considered excellent
antimicrobial agents. When targeting Gram-Negative pathogens,
third-generation cephalosporins exhibit superior sensitivity compared to
first and second-generation counterparts. As an initial empirical
treatment for severe cases of bacterial keratitis and those unresponsive
to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones in community settings, the
combination therapy of vancomycin and tobramycin is a justifiable
approach. Bacterial keratitis can be better managed by understanding the
local etiology and antibacterial drug susceptibility patterns.

citrullination is a novel candidate diagnostic marker and druggable
target for HPV-associated cervical cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Citrullination is an emerging post-translational modification catalyzed
by peptidyl-arginine deiminases (PADs) that convert peptidyl-arginine
into peptidyl-citrulline. In humans, the PAD family consists of five
isozymes (PADs 1-4, 6) involved in multiple diseases, including cancer.
Given that high-risk (hr) human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the
etiological agents of cervical cancer, in this study, we sought to
determine whether PAD-mediated protein citrullination would play a
functional role in the HPV-driven transformation of epithelial cells.
Here we show that both total protein citrullination and PAD4 expression
levels are significantly associated with cervical cancer progression.
Specifically, epithelial immunostaining for PAD4 revealed an
increasingly higher histoscore from low-grade (CIN1) to high-grade
(CIN2, CIN3) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) lesions, raising the attractive possibility that
PAD4 may be used as tumor staging markers. Furthermore, taking advantage
of the epidermoid cervical cancer cell line CaSki, which harbors
multiple copies of the integrated HPV16 genome, we show that the
expression of E6 and E7 HPV oncoproteins is impaired by treatment with
the pharmacological pan-PAD inhibitor BB-Cl-amidine. Consistently, p53
and p21, two targets of HPV oncoproteins, are upregulated by the PAD
inhibitor, which undergoes cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Altogether,
these findings highlight a novel mechanism by which hrHPVs alter host
regulatory pathways involved in cell cycle and survival to gain viral
fitness, raising the possibility that PADs may represent an attractive
target for developing novel host-targeting antivirals effective in
preventing cervical cancer progression.
