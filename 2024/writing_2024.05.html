<p>I get fascinated by the videos that purport to reveal the secret
story behind something that isn’t hard to follow. (Coraline’s plot is
not tortuous or complex. It doesn’t make it a better story to claim all
the adults in it are dead or whatever.)</p>

<p>Since August I’ve been watching Doctor Who with an obsessed 8 year

skipped 12 (don’t know why) and we are deep in 13 (which I had skipped
much of).</p>
