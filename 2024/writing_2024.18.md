date: 2024-04-29, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Dead Cat Tail Assassins</strong>, P. Djèlí Clark (Tordotcom 978-1-25076-704-2, $20.99, 224pp, hc) April 2024.</p>
<p>Like Chekhov’s famous gun, it seems to be an un­stated principle among writers as diverse as Rob­ert Ludlum and Octavia E. Butler that a character suffering from total amnesia in the first act is in for some world-shaking revelations by the third. The same is true of P. Djèlí Clark’s <strong>The Dead Cat Tail </strong> <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/04/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-the-dead-cat-tail-assassins-by-p-djeli-clark/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

**@Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky** (date: 2024-04-28, from: Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky)

Big proud happy face. Toby created the version of Dead Boy Detectives that inspired Steve Yockey to make the TV show. (Toby, now's when you point out to DC Comics how much you'd like to write a DBD novel.)

## Paul Di Filippo Reviews A View from the Stars by Cixin Liu

date: 2024-04-28, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>A View from the Stars</strong>, Cixin Liu (Tor 978-1250292117, hardcover, 224pp, $27.99) April 2024</p>
<p>Most authors segregate their fiction from their non-fiction, compiling the two classes of work into separate collections. I always recall one exception I read as a teen, a minor Frederik Pohl volume titled <b>Digits &#38; Dastards</b>, which featured two essays along with the stories. And I suppose that Harlan Ellison’s inclusion of long anecdotal  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/04/paul-di-filippo-reviews-a-view-from-the-stars-by-cixin-liu/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Jake Casella Brookins Reviews Truth of the Aleke by Moses Ose Utomi

date: 2024-04-28, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Truth of the Aleke</strong>, Moses Ose Utomi (Tor­dotcom 978-1-2508-4905-2, $24.99, 112pp, hc) March 2023. Cover by Alyssa Winans.</p>
<p>Among the more fascinating things that Moses Ose Utomi seems to be doing with his Forever Desert series is looking at how worldviews change with experience. The protagonist of <strong>The Lies of the Ajungo</strong>, a young teenage boy, cut through the titular deception with a heroic self-sacrifice.
