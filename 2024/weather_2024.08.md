Day 2 Convective Outlook

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE WEDNESDAY
EVENING INTO THURSDAY NIGHT ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHEASTERN
KANSAS...NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA AND SOUTHWESTERN MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
A localized area of strong thunderstorm development is possible
across parts of the Ozark Plateau and adjacent Great Plains into
middle Mississippi Valley vicinity late Wednesday evening into early
Thursday, with some risk for severe hail.

...Synopsis...
A significant short wave perturbation, splitting away from one
stronger branch of westerlies across the northern mid-latitude
eastern Pacific, is forecast to contribute to a deepening cyclone
while digging southeastward through this period.  As it approaches
another branch of stronger westerlies across the southern mid- and
subtropical latitudes, models indicate that a downstream
perturbation within that stream will accelerate inland across
southern California and northern Baja by early Wednesday.  A rapid
east-northeastward progression is then forecast to continue, through
the crest of initially more amplified large-scale mid/upper ridging
across the central Great Plains into middle Mississippi/Ozark
Plateau by 12Z Thursday.

At the same time, downstream large-scale mid-level troughing off the
southern Atlantic Seaboard appears likely to remain amplified, with
some further amplification southward to the east of the Bahamas
possible, with continuing cyclogenesis across the western Atlantic. 
Northerly flow and subsidence in the wake of this regime has
contributed to considerable drying across much of the Gulf Basin
into Caribbean.  While some modification is ongoing across the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico through northwestern Gulf coast
vicinity, model forecast soundings indicate that boundary-layer
moistening will remain rather modest and shallow, beneath warm and
capping layers in the lower/mid-troposphere spreading east of the
southern Rockies/Mexican Plateau.

...Ozark Plateau/adjacent Great Plains and Mississippi Valley...
It does appear that surface low pressure will deepen to the lee of
the southern Rockies, northeastward toward the southern Great Lakes
region Wednesday through Wednesday night. This likely will be
accompanied by strengthening southerly low-level return flow and at
least some moistening.  However, if, and exactly where, associated
large-scale forcing for ascent and destabilization become sufficient
to overcome mid-level inhibition remains unclear based on latest
model output.  

Guidance continues to suggest that any thunderstorm development will
probably be rooted within the evolving lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection regime across and east-northeast of the Ozark Plateau
vicinity late Wednesday evening through early Thursday, though
probabilities at any particular location appear low (on the order of
10-20 percent).  It might not be out of the question that initial
thunderstorm development could be accompanied by some risk for
severe hail somewhere across parts of the Ozark Plateau and adjacent
Great Plains/middle Mississippi Valley, but this potential stills
seems rather conditional at this point.

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton.. 02/20/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0100 AM CST Tue Feb 20 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain limited for today
across the country, though localized concerns are probable across
eastern NM into west TX. Early-morning surface observations show a
weak lee trough/thermal axis draped along the southern High Plains.
This feature is likely the result of persistent downslope
warming/drying amid a nearly zonal flow regime over the
central/southern Rockies. This flow regime will persist for much of
today as the upper ridge shifts east. While the approach of the
ridge will suppress substantial deepening of the lee trough, breezy
and dry conditions are likely in the lee of more prominent terrain
features. Sustained winds between 15-25 mph are expected with
diurnal RH reductions into the upper teens to low 20s. Consequently,
areas of elevated fire weather conditions are expected - primarily
in the lee of the Sangre de Cristo and Sandia Manzano mountains
across east/northeast NM. Elevated conditions may extend as far east
as the NM/TX border. Despite this potential, recent fuel guidance
continues to indicate that ERCs are at or below the 50th percentile
across this region, which precludes introducing fire weather
headlines. However, the warm, dry, and breezy conditions today will
likely help dry finer fuels ahead of a more robust wind event on
D2/Wednesday.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1005 AM CST Tue Feb 20 2024

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast through tonight.

..Western States...
A large upper low remains off the Pacific Northwest coast with a
series of smaller shortwave troughs rotating inland through the
forecast period.  This will lead to occasional clusters of showers
and isolated thunderstorms over parts of CA, and inland into
portions of OR/ID and NV/UT/AZ.  Overall coverage of thunderstorms
should remain quite sparse.

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
A progressive trough-ridge-trough pattern will characterize
mid/upper levels through the period.  The eastern synoptic trough
will move offshore to the Atlantic overnight, after consolidating
from shortwave troughs now over the Mid-South/Tennessee Valley
region, eastern NC and the FL Peninsula and vicinity.  A low-
amplitude synoptic ridge, with broadly anticyclonic bracketing flow,
will cross the central CONUS.  

A well-developed synoptic trough was evident in moisture-channel
imagery off the West Coast, with embedded cyclone center about 150
nm west-southwest of OTH.  A basal shortwave trough was readily
apparent well west of southern CA and Baja, between 27N-35N,
approaching 130W.  As the cyclone weakens and shifts north-
northeastward toward the AST/HQM area by the end of the period, the
basal trough should weaken slightly and move eastward to a position
just offshore from southern CA and northern Baja.  A series of
small/low-amplitude shortwaves and vorticity lobes will traverse the
southwest flow preceding the northeastern Pacific trough,
contributing to cooling aloft and modest low/middle-level moistening
over portions of the interior West, as well as atop the marine air
mass near the coast.  Associated 100-500 J/kg MUCAPE (greatest near
the coast) will support episodic thunder potential, mainly over the
outlook areas, though very isolated flashes cannot be ruled out over
much of the area west of the Rockies.  The combined shear/
instability parameter space should be too weak to support severe
potential.
