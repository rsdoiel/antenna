Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0745 AM CDT Wed Apr 24 2024

Valid 241300Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING
ACROSS WEST CENTRAL TX...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated large hail and damaging winds will be possible this evening
across west central Texas.

...West central TX this evening...
A midlevel shortwave trough off the southern CA coast will move
inland over southern AZ by the end of the period.  Downstream,
shortwave ridging will persist over the Plains, though some increase
in westerly flow over the Rockies will contribute to lee troughing
across eastern CO/NM.  The lee trough will maintain southerly
low-level flow and a gradual increase in low-level moisture to the
south of a warm front that will move slowly northward across OK and
the TX Panhandle.  The moistening (boundary-layer dewpoints of 64-70
F and 100 mb mean mixing ratios of 12-14 g/kg) will occur beneath a
warm elevated mixed layer with midlevel lapse rates of 8-9 C/km,
which will drive large buoyancy (MLCAPE > 2000 J/kg) within a capped
warm sector.

The potential exception to this is along the developing dryline
across west central TX where surface heating/mixing could be deep
enough to remove convective inhibition, and isolated thunderstorm
development will be possible by this afternoon/evening.  Confidence
in storm development is modest, but the environment with large
buoyancy, steep lapse rates and effective bulk shear greater than 40
kt will conditionally favor supercells capable of producing isolated
very large hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter and severe outflow
gusts of 60-70 mph.  There will be an increase in low-level shear
this evening and low-level moisture will be greater compared to
yesterday, so an isolated tornado will also be possible in a narrow
time window this evening before inhibition increases and storms
weaken.

...OK into KS through tonight...
Elevated thunderstorms are ongoing over western OK in a zone of
low-midlevel warm advection and weak buoyancy likely rooted near 700
mb.  Some of this convection could persist today while spreading
eastward, with a low-end hail threat.  Additional elevated storms
are expected to form overnight from northeast OK into KS with
strengthening warm advection and increasing low-level moisture.  A
couple of storms could produce isolated large hail the last few
hours of the forecast period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 AM CDT Wed Apr 24 2024

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN AND
CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will cross the Southwest during the day, while a
related 60-70 kt southwesterly midlevel jet overspreads the southern
into central High Plains. In response, a lee cyclone will rapidly
deepen over eastern CO/western KS, while a southward-extending
dryline sharpens over parts of west TX. This large-scale pattern
evolution will favor an expansive area of high-end critical
fire-weather conditions across the southern into central High Plains
during the afternoon. 

...Southern into Central High Plains...
Behind the dryline, strong downslope warming/drying and diurnal
heating will result in a deep/dry boundary layer, characterized by
surface temperatures in the 80s and single-digit to lower-teens RH.
Here, a tightening surface pressure gradient peripheral to the
deepening lee cyclone, coupled with mixing into the strong
deep-layer southwesterly flow, will yield 30 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds (with gusts upwards of 45 mph) across
eastern NM into southeastern CO. While confidence is high in the
development of these extremely critical meteorological conditions, a
potential lack of abundant and very dry fuels precludes Extremely
Critical highlights at this time.

1123 AM CDT Tue Apr 23 2024

Valid 231630Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR NORTHWEST
TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail
(potentially 2+ inch diameter) and gusts to 65 mph will be possible
this afternoon and evening across northwest Texas.

...Northwest TX...
Visible satellite imagery and surface analysis this morning indicate
the initial stage of moisture return is occurring across the
southern Great Plains in the wake of a frontal intrusion into the
Gulf a few days ago.  A mid-level ridge will increasingly become
established across the central/southern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains as a Great Lakes disturbance gradually becomes more displaced
from the region.  An associated cold front will move southward
across KS/OK before eventually stalling tonight across southeast OK
and northwest TX.  Weak lee cyclogenesis will aid in maintaining a
southerly low-level fetch across central into west TX as strong
heating results in a sharpening dryline by late afternoon.  Isolated
thunderstorm development will be most probable near the triple point
20-22Z.  Steep lapse rates coupled with adequate moisture (1500-2000
J/kg MLCAPE) and veering flow beneath moderate westerlies, will
support an initial supercell mode.  Isolated very large hail of
2-2.5 inches in diameter will be the main threat, along with a few
55-65 mph gusts.

...Northern IL/southeast WI/Lower MI late this afternoon/evening...
Have not changed the existing outlook for this region due primarily
to consistency in model data and the forecast conceptual model not
deviating.  Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid-level
trough over the Upper Midwest and this will continue southeast into
the central Great Lakes by mid evening.  An associated surface
trough will likewise move southeastward, and this trough will be
preceded by a band of rain with minimal buoyancy.  Behind the rain
band, surface heating with steepening low-level lapse rates and
cooling midlevel temperatures will support weak surface-based
buoyancy just ahead of a secondary frontal surge.  Some low-topped
convection will be possible late this afternoon through late evening
from northern IL/southeast WI into Lower MI.  The stronger storms
could yield a localized marginal hail/damaging wind threat.

or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 04/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CDT Tue Apr 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will advance east-southeastward from the Midwest
toward the Northeast through the period, while an upper ridge
encompasses much of the West. On the backside of the midlevel
trough, a post-frontal air mass will infiltrate the northern and
central Plains, where breezy/gusty northerly surface winds are
expected. Over portions of southern NE and KS, these winds could
briefly overlap 20-30 percent afternoon RH, favoring locally
elevated fire-weather conditions -- given receptive fuels across the
area. However, these conditions appear too brief and marginal for
Elevated highlights at this time.

Farther west, dry/breezy conditions are expected across the
Southwest during the afternoon. However, fuels are generally not
supportive of large fires at this time.

0344 PM CDT Mon Apr 22 2024

Valid 241200Z - 301200Z

A relatively active fire weather pattern is poised to set up across
the southern High Plains late this week through this weekend. By
Thursday, the first in a series of mid-level troughs will approach
the southern Rockies, with surface low development likely across the
central High Plains. By Thursday afternoon, a dryline will surge
eastward across the southern High Plains, with Critically dry and
windy conditions occurring behind the dryline. For Friday through
the weekend, the approach/passage of another mid-level trough and
associated surface cyclone will support continued eastward dryline
surges over the southern High Plains, accompanied by Critically dry
and windy conditions each afternoon. 70 percent Critical
probabilities have been issued Days 4-6 (Thursday-Saturday) where
Critical conditions should be most prolonged, and where fuels are
most receptive to wildfire spread. Dry conditions should persist
across the southern High Plains into early next week, though it is
currently unclear if the surface winds will approach Critical
thresholds.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER FAR
SOUTHEASTERN FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to locally severe thunderstorms, capable of marginally severe
wind gusts and hail, remain possible near the southeast Florida
coast this afternoon.

No changes were made to the ongoing outlook.

A low threat of severe storms remains this afternoon for the coastal
counties of far southeastern FL. Storms are ongoing near a weak
boundary, with 1500+ J/kg MUCAPE present. Locally strong gusts or
brief/marginal hail may occur over the next few hours, prior to
storms moving offshore.

..Jewell.. 04/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1111 AM CDT Mon Apr 22 2024/

...South FL...
Visible satellite imagery shows a swelling cumulus field over the
Everglades and South FL ahead of a southward-progressing cold front
over the northern part of the Everglades.  A mid-level shortwave
trough located over the Carolinas/northeast Gulf of Mexico
--embedded within a larger-scale eastern North America trough-- will
continue east into the western Atlantic through the evening. 
Continued warming of a moist airmass across south FL will yield
moderate destabilization.  Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to
develop in the vicinity of the front through the mid afternoon. 
Long, straight hodographs combined with more than adequate CAPE will
potentially yield a couple of organized storms.  An isolated risk
for large hail and/or localized damaging gust will be the primary
hazards with the most intense storms.  This activity will push east
of the coast by early evening.  

Elsewhere, quiescent conditions will prevail across a large part of
the contiguous United States.
