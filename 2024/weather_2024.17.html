Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0731 AM CDT Thu Apr 25 2024

Valid 251300Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING
ACROSS WESTERN KS AND TONIGHT ACROSS NORTHWEST TX INTO CENTRAL OK...

...SUMMARY...
Very large hail up to 3 inches in diameter and a strong tornado or
two will be possible this evening across western Kansas.  Large hail
up to 2.5 inches in diameter, damaging winds to 70 mph and a few
tornadoes will be possible tonight from northwest Texas into central
Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough and associated 70 kt jet will eject
northeastward toward western KS by late tonight and Friday morning. 
An associated lee cyclone is expected to deepen this afternoon
across northeast CO, with a sharpening dryline arcing to its south
across western KS and the TX/OK Panhandles.  Farther east, a warm
front will continue to move northward from OK into KS, though
northward progress of the front will be slowed by elevated
convection (posing an isolated large hail threat) that will
reinforce the cool side of the boundary during the day.  A somewhat
bimodal threat distribution is expected - the warm sector in western
KS and a second corridor overnight from northwest TX into OK.

...Western KS this afternoon/evening...
An unstable warm sector will be present through this evening, with
boundary-layer dewpoints in the 60s beneath steep midlevel lapse
rates.  The base of the elevated mixed layer will be relatively
warm, suggesting the need for surface temperatures into the 80s on
the immediate moist side of the dryline.  The better potential for
storm development this afternoon will be across western KS, where
dryline parcel residence times will be longer and in closer
proximity to the left-exit region of the approaching mid-upper jet. 
The initial dryline storms will likely become supercells capable of
producing very large hail of 2-3 inches in diameter, and these
storms could continue northeastward as elevated supercells atop the
warm front.  The potential for a strong tornado or two will increase
this evening as the storms encounter richer low-level moisture and
increasing low-level shear.  However, the window of opportunity will
not be particularly large given the presence of a rain-reinforced
front to the northeast and increasing convective inhibition by late
evening.

...Northwest TX into OK overnight...
A general consensus of most overnight forecast guidance suggests a
southern corridor of greater hail/wind threat starting early tonight
just off the Caprock and then spreading northeastward over northwest
TX into southwest/central OK early Friday morning.  Thunderstorm
initiation will become more probable by 03-06z in association with
cooling/moistening at the base of the elevated mixed layer,
coincident with the beginning of eastward movement of the
dryline/Pacific cold front along the trailing influence of the
ejecting midlevel trough.  Storm mode will likely trend to
clusters/line segments while spreading northeastward. 
Boundary-layer dewpoints approaching the upper 60s beneath steep
midlevel lapse rates will contribute to MUCAPE in excess of 2000
J/kg through the overnight hours, which will favor the potential for
both large hail (especially with any embedded supercells) and
damaging winds of 60-70 mph.  A few tornadoes may also occur with
embedded circulations as low-level shear increases tonight.

...TX Panhandle/western OK this afternoon/evening...
A conditionally favorable environment for supercells with very large
hail and tornadoes will exist this afternoon/evening across the
eastern TX Panhandle into western OK.  The primary uncertainty here
will be lingering convective inhibition and substantial uncertainty
in storm coverage/location along the dryline.  For these reasons,
have lowered the overall severe threat, but maintained some
conditional significant severe potential.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0400 AM CDT Thu Apr 25 2024

Valid 281200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...D4/Sunday - Northeast TX into parts of the upper MS Valley...
Some severe threat is expected persist into D4/Sunday from northeast
TX into parts of the upper MS Valley, as an amplified
mid/upper-level shortwave trough moves from the Great Plains into
the upper Great Lakes region. Substantial convection on D3/Saturday
results in some uncertainty regarding storm evolution on Sunday.
However, guidance generally suggests that a strong mid/upper-level
jet associated with the ejecting shortwave will overspread a
relatively moist warm sector, with potential redevelopment of
organized convection along/ahead of a cold front. 

There is some potential for the threat to be bimodal, with one
potential area from eastern KS into northern MO and IA in closer
proximity to the ejecting shortwave, and a separate area across the
ArkLaTex vicinity, within a region of somewhat more favorable
moisture and instability. However, with storm evolution remaining
rather uncertain, a continuous 15% area has been maintained in this
outlook, with some adjustments. 

...D5/Monday - Southern Plains into the lower MS Valley...
Guidance generally suggests that a low-amplitude shortwave trough
will move across parts of TX into the lower MS Valley on Monday.
There is some potential for this shortwave to impinge upon a region
of moderate to strong buoyancy along and south of a weak surface
boundary that may begin to lift northward across parts of TX/LA
during the day. A few severe storms with a threat of hail and
damaging winds would be possible in this scenario. However,
uncertainty related to substantial antecedent convection and its
effect on boundary placement renders predictability too low for
probabilities at this time. 

...D6/Tuesday - D8/Thursday...
Spread begins to notably increase in extended-range guidance
regarding pattern evolution by D6/Tuesday. In general, stronger
mid/upper-level flow is expected to shift northward, through there
will be some potential for shortwave troughs and related cold fronts
to impinge upon a reservoir of richer low-level moisture and
stronger buoyancy from the southern Plains into parts of the
Southeast/OH Valley. Confidence in the details regarding any severe
potential in this time frame is much too low for probabilities with
this outlook.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 AM CDT Wed Apr 24 2024

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN AND
CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will cross the Southwest during the day, while a
related 60-70 kt southwesterly midlevel jet overspreads the southern
into central High Plains. In response, a lee cyclone will rapidly
deepen over eastern CO/western KS, while a southward-extending
dryline sharpens over parts of west TX. This large-scale pattern
evolution will favor an expansive area of high-end critical
fire-weather conditions across the southern into central High Plains
during the afternoon. 

...Southern into Central High Plains...
Behind the dryline, strong downslope warming/drying and diurnal
heating will result in a deep/dry boundary layer, characterized by
surface temperatures in the 80s and single-digit to lower-teens RH.
Here, a tightening surface pressure gradient peripheral to the
deepening lee cyclone, coupled with mixing into the strong
deep-layer southwesterly flow, will yield 30 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds (with gusts upwards of 45 mph) across
eastern NM into southeastern CO. While confidence is high in the
development of these extremely critical meteorological conditions, a
potential lack of abundant and very dry fuels precludes Extremely
Critical highlights at this time.

Valid 231630Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR NORTHWEST
TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail
(potentially 2+ inch diameter) and gusts to 65 mph will be possible
this afternoon and evening across northwest Texas.

...Northwest TX...
Visible satellite imagery and surface analysis this morning indicate
the initial stage of moisture return is occurring across the
southern Great Plains in the wake of a frontal intrusion into the
Gulf a few days ago.  A mid-level ridge will increasingly become
established across the central/southern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains as a Great Lakes disturbance gradually becomes more displaced
from the region.  An associated cold front will move southward
across KS/OK before eventually stalling tonight across southeast OK
and northwest TX.  Weak lee cyclogenesis will aid in maintaining a
southerly low-level fetch across central into west TX as strong
heating results in a sharpening dryline by late afternoon.  Isolated
thunderstorm development will be most probable near the triple point
20-22Z.  Steep lapse rates coupled with adequate moisture (1500-2000
J/kg MLCAPE) and veering flow beneath moderate westerlies, will
support an initial supercell mode.  Isolated very large hail of
2-2.5 inches in diameter will be the main threat, along with a few
55-65 mph gusts.

...Northern IL/southeast WI/Lower MI late this afternoon/evening...
Have not changed the existing outlook for this region due primarily
to consistency in model data and the forecast conceptual model not
deviating.  Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid-level
trough over the Upper Midwest and this will continue southeast into
the central Great Lakes by mid evening.  An associated surface
trough will likewise move southeastward, and this trough will be
preceded by a band of rain with minimal buoyancy.  Behind the rain
band, surface heating with steepening low-level lapse rates and
cooling midlevel temperatures will support weak surface-based
buoyancy just ahead of a secondary frontal surge.  Some low-topped
convection will be possible late this afternoon through late evening
from northern IL/southeast WI into Lower MI.  The stronger storms
could yield a localized marginal hail/damaging wind threat.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CDT Tue Apr 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will advance east-southeastward from the Midwest
toward the Northeast through the period, while an upper ridge
encompasses much of the West. On the backside of the midlevel
trough, a post-frontal air mass will infiltrate the northern and
central Plains, where breezy/gusty northerly surface winds are
expected. Over portions of southern NE and KS, these winds could
briefly overlap 20-30 percent afternoon RH, favoring locally
elevated fire-weather conditions -- given receptive fuels across the
area. However, these conditions appear too brief and marginal for
Elevated highlights at this time.

Farther west, dry/breezy conditions are expected across the
Southwest during the afternoon. However, fuels are generally not
supportive of large fires at this time.

Valid 241200Z - 301200Z

A relatively active fire weather pattern is poised to set up across
the southern High Plains late this week through this weekend. By
Thursday, the first in a series of mid-level troughs will approach
the southern Rockies, with surface low development likely across the
central High Plains. By Thursday afternoon, a dryline will surge
eastward across the southern High Plains, with Critically dry and
windy conditions occurring behind the dryline. For Friday through
the weekend, the approach/passage of another mid-level trough and
associated surface cyclone will support continued eastward dryline
surges over the southern High Plains, accompanied by Critically dry
and windy conditions each afternoon. 70 percent Critical
probabilities have been issued Days 4-6 (Thursday-Saturday) where
Critical conditions should be most prolonged, and where fuels are
most receptive to wildfire spread. Dry conditions should persist
across the southern High Plains into early next week, though it is
currently unclear if the surface winds will approach Critical
thresholds.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER FAR
SOUTHEASTERN FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to locally severe thunderstorms, capable of marginally severe
wind gusts and hail, remain possible near the southeast Florida
coast this afternoon.

No changes were made to the ongoing outlook.

A low threat of severe storms remains this afternoon for the coastal
counties of far southeastern FL. Storms are ongoing near a weak
boundary, with 1500+ J/kg MUCAPE present. Locally strong gusts or
brief/marginal hail may occur over the next few hours, prior to
storms moving offshore.

..Jewell.. 04/22/2024

...South FL...
Visible satellite imagery shows a swelling cumulus field over the
Everglades and South FL ahead of a southward-progressing cold front
over the northern part of the Everglades.  A mid-level shortwave
trough located over the Carolinas/northeast Gulf of Mexico
--embedded within a larger-scale eastern North America trough-- will
continue east into the western Atlantic through the evening. 
Continued warming of a moist airmass across south FL will yield
moderate destabilization.  Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to
develop in the vicinity of the front through the mid afternoon. 
Long, straight hodographs combined with more than adequate CAPE will
potentially yield a couple of organized storms.  An isolated risk
for large hail and/or localized damaging gust will be the primary
hazards with the most intense storms.  This activity will push east
of the coast by early evening.  

Elsewhere, quiescent conditions will prevail across a large part of
the contiguous United States.
