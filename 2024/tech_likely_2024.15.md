## Number of Distances Separating Points Has a New Bound

date: 2024-04-09, from: Quanta Magazine

Mathematicians have struggled to prove Falconer’s Conjecture, a simple, but far-reaching, hypothesis about the distances between points.

## 24 hours in AI news

date: 2024-04-09, from: Gary Marcus blog

A bunch of small but important items in recently-breaking AI news: Tesla settled their lawsuit with the Huang family over Walter Huang&#8217;s death, for an undisclosed amount of money. &#8220;Although Huang&#8217;s family acknowledges he was distracted while the car was driving, they argued Tesla is at fault because it falsely marketed Autopilot as self-driving software. They alleged Tesla knew that Autopilot was not ready for prime time and had flaws that could make its use unsafe.&#8221; The settlement is striking in part because Musk had previously said this

## Code in Context: How AI Can Help Improve Our Documentation

Here&#8217;s the latest installment in the series on working with LLMS: https://thenewstack.io/code-in-context-how-ai-can-help-improve-our-documentation/.

## Making Ultra-fast Electron Measurements in Multiple Directions to Reveal the Secrets of the Aurora

date: 2024-04-09, from: NASA breaking news

The energetic electrons that drive the aurora borealis (the northern lights) have a rich and very dynamic structure that we currently do not fully understand.  Much of what we know about these electrons comes from instruments that have fundamental limitations in their ability to sample multiple energies with high time resolution. To overcome these limitations, NASA is using an innovative approach to develop instrumentation that will enhance our measurement capabilities by more than an order of magnitude—revealing a wealth of new information about the amazing physics happening within the aurora.

## Maldives 2024

date: 2024-04-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="maldives-2024">Maldives 2024</h1>

<p>The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.</p>

<p>The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane, Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the <a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible, too.</p>

<p>With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in 2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to the Maledivez.</p>

<p>The last leg of the journey – our water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue, and the reef begins a few meters in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10 before we left.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This ray we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to hide in the sand.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.</p>

## Ten years ago, Windows XP received its final update

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

Exactly ten years ago, on April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the final security patch for Windows XP. The day marked the end of the road for one of the most iconic Windows versions ever released. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I never liked Windows XP. Compared to the operating systems I was using at the time &#8211; BeOS, Mandrake Linux 8.x &#8211; Windows XP felt kind of like a bad joke I wasn&#8217;t in on. It looked ridiculous, didn&#8217;t seem to offer anything substantial, and it didn&#8217;t take long for major security incidents related to Windows XP to start dominating the news. It wasn&#8217;t until several service packs had been released that Windows XP came into its own, but by that point, I had already found a much better alternative for my Windows needs at the time. I&#8217;m of course talking about Windows Server 2003, the better Windows than Windows XP. Today though, I do have an odd fondness for Windows XP, as I grow older and XP has become something from my teenage years. The look and feel of Windows XP &#8211; the classic theme, not that horrendous Fisher Price nonsense &#8211; the sound set, the wallpaper of course &#8211; has become iconic, warts and all, and whole generations of people will feel instant feelings as soon as they see Bliss or hear that iconic startup sound. Windows XP with a few service packs now belongs to the small group of Windows releases that I would call the peak of the platform, together with Windows 95 and Windows 7 (and perhaps Server 2003, but that&#8217;s more of a personal thing and not a consumer operating system). Everything else has not exactly been great or even aged well, and I doubt Windows 10 and 11 will suddenly get good, either.

## Google launches Axion processors, new Arm-based CPUs for the data centre

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

Built using the Arm Neoverse™ V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant leaps in performance for general-purpose workloads like web and app servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training and inferencing, and more. Axion is underpinned by Titanium, a system of purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out offloads. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads storage I/O processing to Hyperdisk, our new block storage service that decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically provisioned in real time. ↫ Amin Vahdat on the Google blog Fancy new ARM processors from Google, designed explicitly for the data centre. In other words, we&#8217;ll never get to play with it unless one makes its way to eBay in a few years.

## Embedding the Servo web engine in Qt

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve been talking about Servo, the Rust browser engine project originally started at Mozilla, for a while now, and while the project&#8217;s still got a long way to go, it&#8217;s definitely a serious contender to become a competitive browser engine in the future. It seems it&#8217;s starting to get some traction already, as The KDAB Group is working on bringing Servo to Qt. At KDAB we managed to embed the Servo web engine inside Qt, by using our CXX-Qt library as a bridge between Rust and C++. This means that we can now use Servo as an alternative to Chromium for webviews in Qt applications. ↫ Andrew Hayzen and Magnus Groß They&#8217;re already showing off a basic QML application rendering websites using Servo, which is pretty cool. It goes to show that Servo can definitely eventually fulfill the role that Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko fulfill now.

## Intel’s ambitious Meteor Lake iGPU

date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News

Intel and AMD both tried to ship iGPUs fast enough to compete with low end discrete cards over the past 10 years with mixed results. Recently though, powerful iGPUs have been thrown back into the spotlight. Handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck and ASUS’s ROG Ally demonstrated that consumers are willing to accept compromises to play games on the go. AMD has dominated that market so far. Valve’s Steam Deck uses AMD’s Van Gogh APU, and the ROG Ally uses the newer Phoenix APU. Unlike Van Gogh, Phoenix is a general purpose mobile chip with both a powerful CPU and GPU. Phoenix doesn’t stop at targeting the handheld segment, and threatens Intel’s laptop market share too. In response, Meteor Lake brings a powerful iGPU to the party. It has the equivalent of 128 EUs and clocks up to 2.25 GHz, making it modestly wider and much faster than Raptor Lake’s 96 EU, 1.5 GHz iGPU. Raptor Lake’s Xe-LP graphics architecture gets replaced by Xe-LPG, a close relative of the Xe-HPG architecture used in Intel’s A770 discrete GPU. At the system level, Meteor Lake moves to a GPU integration scheme that better suits a chiplet configuration where the iGPU gets significant transistor and area budget. I’ll be testing Meteor Lake’s iGPU with the Core Ultra 7 155H, as implemented in the ASUS Zenbook 14. I purchased the device myself in late February. ↫ Chips and Cheese I&#8217;m absolutely here for the resurgence in capable integrated GPUs, both for PC gaming on the go and for better graphics performance even in thinner, smaller laptops. I would love to have just a bit more graphics power on my thin and small laptop so I can do some basic gaming with it.

## Google launches new Find My Device network on Android

date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News

Today, the all-new Find My Device is rolling out to Android devices around the world, starting in the U.S. and Canada. With a new, crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices, Find My Device can help you find your misplaced Android devices and everyday items quickly and securely. Here are five ways you can try it out. ↫ Erik Kay on the Google blog This old Android feature has basically been updated to be the same thing as Apple&#8217;s Find My, but with more than just one vendor making the tracking tags. Of course, this means it also comes with the same problems, from its use by stalkers to controlling partners, and everything in between. This is a very problematic technology, one which I think is almost impossible to make safe. Still, I have a Samsung tracker that I don&#8217;t use anymore &#8211; because I bought a Pixel 8 Pro, and don&#8217;t want to install any Samsung applications &#8211; and I do plan on getting a new tracker that&#8217;s compatible with this new Find My Device network. With two small kids, it&#8217;s easy to lose track of something like my car keys, and instead of stressing about where they are when we need to leave on time, I can just ping them using our Google Home devices instead. Sometimes, these silly smart technologies really do take just that little bit of stress out of your life &#8211; you just have to be really picky and honest with yourself about what you really need.

## Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry

date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News

There are various ways you can change the default browser and similar defaults on Windows, but oneof the ways many third-party tools do this is by editing the relevant registry strings. It turns out that Microsoft is not particularly happy with this, as they&#8217;ve recently introduced a new driver specifically designed to prevent this from happening, by blocking tools like regedit or PowerShell from editing a number of registry keys for setting default applications. The driver was discovered by Christoph Kolbicz. Microsoft implemented a driver based protection to block changes to http/https and .pdf associations by 3rd party utilities. The rollout was staggered and activated “randomly”, but in the meantime I got many reports – also from business or education environments (but not Server OS). Microsoft also updated the driver during my tests (from 2.0 to 2.1) and extended the deny list of executables. This means, they can change the behavior almost on the fly and add new tricks or block additional extensions/protocols! ↫ Christoph Kolbicz Digging further into what, exactly, this driver can do, Microsoft also made it so that even if you disable the driver, an additional scheduled task will run to re-enable the driver and revert the registry changes. It also seems this is somehow related to the changes Microsoft has to make to comply with the EU&#8217;s DMA, but the driver is also installed on systems outside of the EU, so it&#8217;s all a bit unclear at the moment.

Over the GNOME&#160;46 cycle, VTE has seen a lot of performance improvements. Christian Hergert mentioned some of them in his blog posts about VTE and about his work in GNOME&#160;46. But how much did the performance actually improve? What should you, the user, expect to feel after installing a fresh Fedora 40 update and launching your favorite terminal? Let’s measure and find out! ↫ Ivan Molodetskikh The short version is that the improvements are definitely noticeable during genera use &#8211; for the long version, read the actual article.

## Insights into students’ attitudes to using AI tools in programming education

date: 2024-04-08, from: Raspberry Pi (.org)

<p>Educators around the world are grappling with the problem of whether to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the classroom. As more and more teachers start exploring the ways to use these tools for teaching and learning computing, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of their use to make sure they do&#8230;</p>

## Different kinds of networks

date: 2024-04-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Somewhat-related notes about different kinds of networks, ActivityPub and RSS, various twitter-like systems, as the social web spreads out and tries out new ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/07/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">With ActivityPub you know who's following you and in RSS you don't. This may sound like a negative until you think about it from the user's standpoint: no spam, spyware, etc. Which is probably why Google didn't like RSS btw. </li>
<li>It has been <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dusoft@fosstodon.org/112230502776773193">pointed out</a> that some level of spying happens based on IP address, and I can testify to that, I get podcasts with ads for a local supermarket, kind of spooky but I guess ok. I can't recall ever receiving spam as a result of subscribing to a feed, and I never get messages from them when I unsub begging me to come back. So it isn't a huge problem in a real way at least for me, yet.</li>
<li>I block spammers. In twitter-like systems, like Mastodon, spam means you attached a post to my post that is in no way responsive to it. You're just trying to coast on the flow generated by other posts. I don't abide that. Have a nice day.</li>
</ul>

## Episode 129 - ALGOL, Part I

date: 2024-04-07, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">ALGOL is one of those topics that's haunted the show for a while. It comes up any time we talk about programming languages, and with good reason. Many of the features and ideas found in modern languages have their roots in ALGOL. Despite that influence, ALGOL itself remains somewhat obscure. It never reached the highs of a C or LISP.</p> <p>In this series we are going to look at ALGOL from 1958 all up to 1968, keeping a careful eye on how the language evolved, how it's problems were addressed, and how new problems were introduced.</p> <p>Selected Sources:</p> <p><a href= "https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/ALGOL/paper/Backus-Syntax_and_Semantics_of_Proposed_IAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/ALGOL/paper/Backus-Syntax_and_Semantics_of_Proposed_IAL.pdf</a> - Backus, 1958 IAL report</p> <p><a href="https://algol60.org/reports/algol60_rr.pdf" rel= "noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://algol60.org/reports/algol60_rr.pdf</a> - ALGOL 1960 Report</p> <p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/1060960.1060966" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/1060960.1060966</a> - Cleaning Up Algol</p> <p> </p>

## Microsoft blocks even more customization apps in Windows 11 version 24H2

date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News

Users recently noticed that third-party apps for customizing the user interface no longer work in the upcoming Windows 11 version 24H2. Not only does Microsoft not allow you to run those apps, but it even blocks you from upgrading to newer builds. StartAllBack, a popular tool for tweaking the taskbar and Start menu in Windows 11, was among the first to fail on 24H2. Sadly, it is not the only one. ExplorerPatcher also no longer works in Windows 11 24H2. ExplorerPatcher from Valinet is quite a popular app that lets you bring back the old Windows 10 taskbar in Windows 11, apply additional modifications to make Windows 11 slightly better, and restore some of its missing features. Windows 11 version 24H2 is now flagging ExplorerPatcher as incompatible due to &#8220;security or performance issues&#8221; with the following message. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I guess the taskbar and Start menu are incredibly important real estate for Microsoft, since it&#8217;s the absolute prime spot for showing ads. If users replace their taskbar and Start menu with something from a third party, that prime real estate is gone. Major conspiracy vibes, yes, and I know this isn&#8217;t the reason, but why else would they be blocking these applications? I can&#8217;t think of anything that makes more sense.

## Outlook is Microsoft’s new data collection service

date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News

With Microsoft’s rollout of the new Outlook for Windows, it appears the company has transformed its email app into a surveillance tool for targeted advertising. Everyone talks about the privacy-washing campaigns of Google and Apple as they mine your online data to generate advertising revenue. But now it looks like Outlook is no longer simply an email service; it’s a data collection mechanism for Microsoft’s 801 external partners and an ad delivery system for Microsoft itself. ↫ Edward Komenda on the Proton blog Now, note that this is an article written by Proton, posted on the company blog, so of course they&#8217;re not going to be too kind towards their competitors. That being said, the article&#8217;s not wrong: the new Outlook web application, now the default in Windows, not only shared your data with around 800 partners, it also displays ads inside of the application. On macOS, it will even show yo fake emails that are, in fact, ads. Furthermore, once you add your accounts to this new Outlook web application, you&#8217;ll also be uploading your username and password to Microsoft, giving them access to your email accounts for advertising and data collection purposes, a shady practice a ton of email clients on mobile devices tend to do as well. Suffice it to say you really shouldn&#8217;t be using this new Outlook, and you should make sure friends and family don&#8217;t either. This is yet another nail in the coffin of Windows, now an advertising and data collection platform first, and operating system second.

## WinBtrfs: an open-source btrfs driver for Windows

date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News

WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs. A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the Linux kernel, and should work on any version from Windows XP onwards. It is also included as part of the free operating system ReactOS. ↫ WinBtrfs GitHub page If you&#8217;re running a distribution that defaults to Btrfs, or you actively choose to use it on other distributions, and you also happen to dual-boot Windows because your boss makes you use some garbage corpo software, this driver will make your setup a bit easier to manage.

## Generative AI as Shakespearean tragedy

date: 2024-04-07, from: Gary Marcus blog

You may have read yesterday&#8217;s New York Times report by Cade Metz and others on how many of the biggest AI companies have been cutting ethical corners in a race to gather as much data as possible (&#8220;OpenAI, Google and Meta ignored corporate policies, altered their own rules and discussed skirting copyright law as they sought online information to train their newest artificial intelligence systems&#8221;).

## How my workday flows

date: 2024-04-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/07/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">On Bluesky, Andrew Hickey <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social/post/3kpjm37omkj2b">explains</a> how hard it is for him to focus while construction is going on at his house. I recognize the problem. I had major work done on the roof of my house last summer, and lost focus for a good two months, even though I had rented office space and at times an AirBnb to get away from the chaos. It wasn't until the work was over that I was able to start to get back into my flow. </p>
<p>In my work, I start pretty much at the same time every day, and I get a good five or six hours before it's time to do the next thing.  The first hour is warming up. Then I go to the notes I left the night before about where I'm going next. By hour two, I'm not quite at my highest rate but getting there, by hours 3-5 I get monster stuff done, if I'm in a good groove. Hour six is iffy. All the while I'm taking short breaks to check email, tweets, whatever. All of it asynchronous. Waiting for my attention to be available, for a short period.</p>
<p>After 5-6 hours of this, I'm wiped out.</p>
<p>I can handle small interruptions, like a package delivery.</p>
<p>But if it involves the front of my brain for any real amount of time, if I have to shift my attention elsewhere, boom, it all drops out of my head. It doesn't take much of a shift in attention to lose the whole thing, and basically have to start over the next day.</p>
<p>Try to imagine a professional tennis player. Do they talk about anything other than tennis during the game. Not with any focus. I'm sure of it. Their attention is fully on the sport. Same deal with intellectual achievement. If you're doing something that few other people do well, you're not only doing the complex things, and require multiple steps and a lot of detail, and memory, but you're sometimes inventing things that no one has done before. All the levels interact and affect each other. And you're doing a shitload of learning the whole time. Until you're burned out for the day that is. Or your deck gets shuffled. ;-)</p>
<p>PS: People sending you emails saying how great your last thing was, they don't interfere at all. ;-)</p>
<p>PPS: I wrote this post during one of my breaks. I won't edit it until the evening, when I do lite work that doesn't require much focus for any duration.</p>

## 2024-04-06 Travelling

date: 2024-04-07, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-06-travelling">2024-04-06 Travelling</h1>

<p>The last ten years, travels – even holiday travels! – have made me more and more nervous. I used to be so cool about travel. We lived abroad and travelled so much. And now I’d prefer to just stay in Switzerland all the time. But my wife still loves to travel and once I’m there, wherever it is, I feel OK again.</p>

<p>I can’t say what it is. A vague anxiety about everything. From the smallest thing like it’s spring and I’m going to miss the next two weeks of flowers, and the bees are all emerging from their reed tubes and I hope our friend is OK with watering the gazillion plants we have and I hope we didn’t forget anything and I hope security checks are going to be OK and foreign dictatorship and secret services are going to stay out of our lives and out of our phones and I hope we have enough money for tips and how much does one tip again?</p>

<p>Back when I was about thirty I argued that equipped with a credit card nothing else mattered. I’d just buy whatever I was missing. These days we start our “packing mound” days beforehand.</p>
