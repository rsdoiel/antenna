## Microsoft tests ads in the Start menu

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

Building on top of recent improvements like grouping recently installed apps and showing your frequently used apps, we are now trying out recommendations to help you discover great apps from the Microsoft Store under Recommended on the Start menu. This will appear only for Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel in the U.S. and will not apply to commercial devices (devices managed by organizations). This can be turned off by going to Settings > Personalization > Start and turning off the toggle for “Show recommendations for tips, app promotions, and more”. As a reminder, we regularly try out new experiences and concepts that may never get released with Windows Insiders to get feedback. Should you see this experience on the Start menu, let us know what you think. We are beginning to roll this out to a small set of Insiders in the Beta Channel at first. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc The Start menu, August 24, 1995 &#8211; April 12, 2024. You made it almost 30 years, buddy.

I was, unfortunately, beheaded today, while visiting Teylers Museum in Haarlem.  This was a trifle inconvenient, but I still managed to smile about it.  This is straight out of the iPhone camera, with no image manipulation.

## Do not use Kagi

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

For quite a while now, you might have noticed various people recommending a search engine called &#8220;Kagi&#8221;. From random people on the internet, to prominent bloggers like John Gruber and David Pierce, they&#8217;ve all been pushing this seemingly new search engine as a paid-for alternative to Google that respects your privacy. Over the past few months to a year, though, more and more cracks started to appear in Kagi&#8217;s image, and I&#8217;ve been meaning to assemble those cracks and tie a bow on them. Well, it turns out I don&#8217;t have to, because lori (I&#8217;m not aware of their full name, so I&#8217;ll stick to lori) already did it for me in a blog post titled &#8220;Why I lost faith in Kagi&#8220;. Even though I knew all of these stories, and even though I was intending to list them in more or less the same way, it&#8217;s still damning to see it all laid out so well (both the story itself, as well as the lovely, accessible, approachable, and simple HTML, but that&#8217;s neither here nor there). Lori&#8217;s summary hits on all the pain points (but you should really read the whole thing): Between the absolute blase attitude towards privacy, the 100% dedication to AI being the future of search, and the completely misguided use of the company&#8217;s limited funds, I honestly can&#8217;t see Kagi as something I could ever recommend to people. Is the search good? I mean…it&#8217;s not really much better than any other search, it heavily leverages Bing like DDG and the other indie search platforms do, the only real killer feature it has to me is the ability to block domains from your results, which I can currently only do in other search engines via a user script that doesn&#8217;t help me on mobile. But what good is filtering out all of the AI generated spamblogs on a search platform that wants to spit more AI generated bullshit at me directly? Sure I can turn it off, but who&#8217;s to say that they won&#8217;t start using my data to fuel their own LLM? They already have an extremely skewed idea of what counts as PII or not. They could easily see using people&#8217;s searches as being &#8220;anonymized&#8221; and decide they&#8217;re fine to use, because their primary business isn&#8217;t search, it&#8217;s AI. ↫ lori at lori&#8217;s blog The examples underpinning all these pain points are just baffling, like how the company was originally an &#8220;AI&#8221; company, made a search engine that charges people for Bing results, and now is going full mask-off with countless terrible, non-working, privacy-invasive &#8220;AI&#8221; tools. Or that thing where the company spent one third of their funding round of $670,000 on starting a T-shirt company in Germany (Kagi is US-based) to print 20,000 free T-shirts for their users that don&#8217;t even advertise Kagi. Or that thing where they claimed they &#8220;forgot&#8221; to pay sales tax for two years and had to raise prices to pay their back taxes. And I can just keep on going. To make matters worse, after publication of the blog post, Kagi&#8217;s CEO started harassing lori over email, and despite lori stating repeatedly they wanted him to stop emailing them, he just kept on going. Never a good look. The worst part of it, though, is the lack of understanding about what privacy means, while telling their users they are super serious about it. Add to that the CEO&#8217;s &#8220;trust me, bro&#8221; attitude, their deals with the shady and homophobic crypto company Brave, and many other things, and the conclusion is that, no, your data is not safe at Kagi at all, and with their primary business being &#8220;AI&#8221; and not search, you know exactly what that means. Do not use Kagi.

## Amazon virtually kills efforts to develop Alexa Skills, disappointing dozens

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

There was a time when it thought that Alexa would yield a robust ecosystem of apps, or Alexa Skills, that would make the voice assistant an integral part of users&#8217; lives. Amazon envisioned tens of thousands of software developers building valued abilities for Alexa that would grow the voice assistant&#8217;s popularity—and help Amazon make some money. But about seven years after launching a rewards program to encourage developers to build Skills, Alexa&#8217;s most preferred abilities are the basic ones, like checking the weather. And on June 30, Amazon will stop giving out the monthly Amazon Web Services credits that have made it free for third-party developers to build and host Alexa Skills. The company also recently told devs that its Alexa Developer Rewards program was ending, virtually disincentivizing third-party devs to build for Alexa. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I&#8217;ve never used Alexa &#8211; Amazon doesn&#8217;t really have a footprint in either The Netherlands or Sweden, so I never really had to care &#8211; but I always thought the Skills were the reason it was so loved. It seemingly makes no sense to me to start killing off this feature, but then, I&#8217;m assuming Amazon has the data to back up the fact people aren&#8217;t using them. It sucks, I guess? Can someone who uses Alexa fill in the blanks for me here?

There was very little to laugh about in this new version, but omg it is such a beautifully presented story. Even if you hated the plot you'd have to watch it just to see the art. And if you're Italian or love Italy, you have to watch it. Anyway now that I know all the twists and how it ends, I'm going to have to watch it again, but I might wait to recover from the experience. It is, at times, hard to watch. But oh so goooood.

In his newsletter today, my buddy Austin Kleon mentions in passing the Hindu concept of the ashramas or stages of life, which is funny because I’ve just been thinking about a novel based on those stages: The Guide, by R. K. Narayan.  Narayan was a great, great genius, and maybe the best comic novelist since [&#8230;]

<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'm a writer and graphic designer in the Seattle area. I can't get enough writing; on top of <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/mind-garden/">blogging</a>, I also write speculative fiction. I love reading, mostly fiction, and use my website as an alternative to Goodreads to write reviews and <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/reading/read-in-2024/">track reads</a>. Over the past several years, I've added more and more things to my site: listens, playlists, recipes, follows, accountability tracking, big questions. </p>
<p>I work in sustainability, previously in local government and now as a consultant. My background is in ecology; I thought I wanted to be a wildlife biologist, but after one field season studying lizards in the Los Angeles suburbs, I realized the itinerant research biologist lifestyle was not for me. </p>
<p>Now I stay connected to nature through my wildlife garden. My yard backs up to a greenbelt, so on top of <a href="https://cascadiainspired.com/diy-lawn-replacement-overview/">ripping out our lawn</a> and planting native plants, we also restored the natural area adjacent. (I ran a blog devoted to Pacific Northwest nature for ten years!) </p>
<p>This probably makes it sound like I blog a lot about the environment, but I get enough of that in my work life, so not much actually! I'll keep notes from webinars and bookmark articles related to work on my website since they're related to learning, but I try to preserve my blog as a non-work thinking space for me to play.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I started my current blog at <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/mind-garden/">tracydurnell.com</a> when I encountered the idea of a <a href="https://indieweb.org/digital_garden">digital garden</a>* in 2021. The concept appealed to me for its looseness and built-in acceptance of incompleteness and imperfection. On my previous blog, <a href="https://cascadiainspired.com/">Cascadia Inspired</a>, I'd locked myself into a narrow pool of topics that no longer matched my life, and felt constrained. Releasing myself upon a boundless format with lower expectations unleashed a deluge of thoughts I hadn't realized had no outlet before (or that I hadn't really given myself space to think). </p>
<p>*(Having learned more about digital gardens, the blog itself is more of a <a href="https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book">commonplace book</a>, but I feel it's fine to trick our brains however we need to to grant ourselves permission to create. Some people <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2022/11/09/tricking-your-brain-into-writing-the-way-you-want/">write in all lowercase</a>, I tell myself my blog is a garden.)</p>
<p>I'd had a handmade HTML portfolio site parked on the domain for years because I felt obliged to have one, but it was a huge pain to update without a content management system. Letting go of that was a great relief in itself, and then reinless blogging was joyfully liberating. (Ironically, this means that one of the last things I now rely on a third party site to host is my design portfolio 😂)</p>
<p>That switch from professional portfolio to blog is why I've done so little to personalize the design of my website: I used the base theme from the year I launched the blog and tweaked the colors slightly, but otherwise only add CSS to solve specific layout or display issues. For too long, I'd been paralyzed by the need to design and code a fully customized site that "represented me as a designer," so I decided to completely release myself from that burden and use the absolute simplest design option. I chose to not care whether people judge me for using a generic template because the purpose of the site is the information on it, not its aesthetics. As long as the styling works to convey the info I want, I'm happy to leave the default. (This prioritization is a design decision in itself, which I suppose represents my practicality when it comes to design 🤷‍♀️) </p>
<p>I first <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/09/23/my-20th-anniversary-of-blogging/">started blogging twenty years ago</a>, when I went to college, to share what I was doing with my family. In that initial blogging phase, I focused on writing about "mini adventures" I took -- but after college I found I didn't <em>do</em> enough to warrant writing about because I was too exhausted after work. I half-heartedly tried some commentary style blogging, but it didn't stick. </p>
<p>In 2012, missing that creative outlet, I started writing at Cascadia Inspired as a way to connect more deeply with Washington nature and explore creative processes. I hoped that having the site would prompt me to go on more hikes, which worked for a while, then became an albatross. </p>
<p>When I started blogging at <a href="http://tracydurnell.com/">TracyDurnell.com</a>, I then faced the conundrum of <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2022/10/27/deciding-what-belongs-on-my-website/">what writing belonged on which blog</a>. More and more, I shifted my writing over to the new site. Now that I was letting myself write about anything, I wanted to. Finally, I put the Cascadia Inspired blog on hiatus last fall.</p>
<p>Since going freelance, I've also been posting weeknotes to help me recognize the progress I'm making on long term projects and keep myself honest about how much I can do in a week. My website is a toolbox in itself: a tool for thinking, a place for storing information, a non-corporate means of tracking my intake, a method of self-kindness and personal growth, an outlet for reflection. It's endlessly adaptable and expandable to my needs. Part of the fun is that it's always evolving.</p>
<p>As an adult, I learned my grandpa had been a letterpress printer, as had his mother; it tickles me that I have wound up in design and (digital) publishing too.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Most of my blogging is reactive, prompted by something I've read. (I've written about <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/12/18/choosing-between-ideas-for-blog-posts/">choosing between ideas</a> for posts.) I especially enjoy finding connections between pieces and seeing whether pairing articles reveals something more than either alone; Tom Critchlow described this, or something like it, as <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/">digital bricolage</a>.</p>
<p>Because lots of my blogging is interspersed with online reading, it happens <em>where</em> I read... which is primarily on my phone. I blog most often in my phone's browser window, which is not ergonomic. For pieces over a certain length and complexity, I do try to move to my desktop, where I still write directly in the browser. (I've written at length about my process for <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/09/27/how-i-approach-crafting-a-blog-post/">crafting long blog posts</a> -- tl;dr many (too many) rounds of revisions.) </p>
<p>I've been paying attention to <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/01/02/challenging-myself-playfully/">what I admire on other blogs</a>, and one of my goals this year is to write more self-prompted articles. Right now I'm experimenting with writing a longer piece in Scrivener, the writing software I use for fiction. Switching to Scrivener for fiction writing made a massive difference, helping me organize my thoughts better, so I'm curious how it will affect blogging. I've also read a couple books specifically for this article -- a fun return to purpose-driven research, which I've rarely had cause for since college. We'll see whether it comes together or I've gathered too much material and overwhelmed myself!</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Ideas aren't a limiting factor for me; I can be creative anywhere, but the question for me is whether I can <em>work</em> in a space. Physical comfort is the most important aspect of a work space for me: decent ergonomics, enough light, not too loud, not too cold. I find not having enough space to spread out to be limiting -- I prefer to have enough room for both my computer and a notebook for brainstorming on paper. </p>
<p>Before the pandemic, I used to work in coffee shops regularly as a commitment device, but it was never that productive because I'd get distracted by friends or noise, be crammed into small tables with my laptop perched precariously, or feel anxious whether I'd bought enough food and drinks. Now I much prefer working at my wide desk with a large monitor and ergonomic keyboard.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>My webhosting is through HostGator, and my domain registrar is NameCheap. I'm on shared hosting, which is sufficient to host all of my websites. </p>
<p>I self-host WordPress as my content management system with <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/12/11/my-current-wordpress-plugins-and-customizations/">these plugins</a>. I use the IndieWeb plugin to enable Webmentions, so I can send and receive comments from other websites. </p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://notes.tracydurnell.com/">notes blog</a> on a subdomain, powered by micro.blog, which is federated.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>While I've run most of my sites on WordPress since 2012, if I was starting today I might explore other options. There's a lot that's great about WordPress, but I find the block structure poorly suited to blogging; fortunately, I can use a plugin to restore the classic editor (for now).</p>
<p>I've chosen to blog under my real name for a number of reasons, but I also can see the value and freedom in anonymity. There are some subjects I'd like to write about that are too personally revealing. (When I first blogged, I wrote openly about some things I now keep private; were the times simpler or was I more naive?)</p>
<p>From a content perspective, I'd try to be more social with my website earlier. Discovering the IndieWeb and meeting other people who think keeping websites is rad has totally enlivened my blogging. I feel <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/">much more connected to the online community</a> than I ever did during my first decade and a half of blogging.</p>
<p>Back in the day I followed mostly big name bloggers and topic-focused blogs, which fostered more parasocial relationships between writer and audience; now <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/blogroll/">I follow a lot of other 'normal people'</a> with personal websites who are sharing their ponderings and slices of life. It's easier for me to engage in a bloggy conversation with people who feel like peers, and fun to join in with what I see others writing about. (How much do our follows reveal our interests versus shape them?)</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Webhosting costs me about $200 a year, and my domain about $15. (Of course, like many people with websites, I have way too many domains so they add up 😉) I begrudgingly subscribe to Google Drive, where I have automatic website backups stored, for $20 a year. Micro.blog is another $5 a month. As a hobby, I consider blogging reasonably affordable at about $25 a month.</p>
<p>I don't mind other people monetizing their blogs, especially with affiliate links, membership programs, and donations. It totally makes sense for people who need more expensive hosting than I can get away with -- but I also think it's fine for people to charge for their work even if they don't "need the money" -- creators shouldn't be ashamed for earning money from their work. The only aspect that troubles me is when content is paywalled, which then removes it from the open web, but I understand that people need to make money and people come first.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Blog recommendations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Mandy Brown's <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/">A Working Library</a>, with reading notes and reflections, and <a href="https://everythingchanges.us/blog/">Everything Changes</a>, with business-adjacent life musings, are both insightful</li>
<li>Anna Havron writes thoughtfully about a meaningful life at <a href="http://annahavron.com/">annahavron.com</a> and practically about getting work done at <a href="https://analogoffice.net/">Analog Office</a></li>
<li>At <a href="https://going-medieval.com/">Going Medieval</a>, Dr. Eleanor Janega writes hilariously (and informatively) about medieval history, gender roles, and how these all tie in to our lives today</li>
</ul>
<p>It'd be interesting to hear from Reimena Yee, a comic artist who has a fun <a href="https://reimenayee.com/">website</a> and interesting <a href="https://blog.reimenayee.com/">blog</a>. I'd also love to hear from <a href="https://erinkissane.com/">Erin Kissane</a>, and if we're going big, Deb Perelman of <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/">Smitten Kitchen</a>!</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'd encourage anyone who wants to meet other bloggers and website makers to check out an <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">IndieWeb online event</a> like Homebrew Website Club, which is held regularly in European and North American timezones. It's not just for technical folks!</p></div>

## GCC 14 dropping IA64 support is final nail in the coffin for Itanium architecture

date: 2024-04-12, updated: 2024-04-12, from: Liam Proven's articles at the Register

<h4>Linux kernel cut it loose, now leading FOSS compiler lands depth-charge on Itanic</h4>
      <p>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 14 should appear any month now, and when it does, it will no longer build binaries for IA64 – or Itanic, as The Reg dubbed it.</p>

## Discord is nuking Nintendo Switch emulator devs and their entire servers

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

Discord has shut down the Discord servers for the Nintendo Switch emulators Suyu and Sudachi and has completely disabled their lead developers’ accounts — and the company isn’t answering our questions about why it went that far. Both Suyu and Sudachi began as forks of Yuzu, the emulator that Nintendo sued out of existence on March 4th. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge This is exactly what people were worried about when Nintendo and Yuzu settled for millions of dollars. Even though it&#8217;s a settlement and not a court ruling, and even tough the code to Yuzu is entirely unaffected by the settlement and freely shareable and usable by anyone, and even though emulators are legal &#8211; the chilling effect this settlement is having is absolutely undeniable. Here we have Discord going far beyond its own official policy, without even giving the affected parties any recourse. It&#8217;s absolutely wild, and highlights just how dangerous it is to rely on Discord for, well, anything. I wish that for once, we&#8217;d actually see a case related to console emulation go to court in either the EU or the US, to make it even clearer that yes, unless you distribute copyrighted code like game ROMs or console firmware, emulators are entirely legal and without any risk. You know, a recent court ruling we could point to to dissuade bullies like Nintendo from threatening innocent developers and ruining their lives because of entirely legal activities. And let me reiterate: don&#8217;t use Discord as for anything other than basic chat. This platform ain&#8217;t got your back.

## DwarfFS: a read-only compression file system

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

DwarFS is a read-only file system with a focus on achieving very high compression ratios in particular for very redundant data.  DwarFS also doesn&#8217;t compromise on speed and for my use cases I&#8217;ve found it to be on par with or perform better than SquashFS. For my primary use case, DwarFS compression is an order of magnitude better than SquashFS compression, it&#8217;s 6 times faster to build the file system, it&#8217;s typically faster to access files on DwarFS and it uses less CPU resources. ↫ DwarfFS GitHub page DwarfFS supports both Linux, macOS, and Windows, but macOS and Windows support is experimental at this point. It seems to have higher compression ratios at faster speeds than various alternatives, so if you have a use case for compression file systems &#8211; give DwarfFS a look.

## OpenBSD is a cozy operating system

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

With the recent release of OpenBSD 7.5, I decided to run through my personal OpenBSD &#8220;installer&#8221; for laptop/desktop devices. The project is built off of the dwm tiling window manager and only installs a few basic packages. The last time I updated it was with the release of 7.3, so it&#8217;s been due for an minor rework. While making these minor changes, I remembered how incredibly easy the entire install process for OpenBSD is and how cozy the entire operating system feels. All the core systems just work out the box. Yes, you need to &#8220;patch&#8221; in WiFi with a firmware update, so you&#8217;ll need an Ethernet connection during the initial setup. Yes, the default desktop environment is not intuitive or ideal for newcomers. But the positives heavily outweigh the negatives (in my opinion). ↫ Bradley Taunt OpenBSD has a very dedicated community, and I&#8217;ve noticed they tend to be very helpful and friendly. It&#8217;s making me curious about trying it out, and both this article and the helpful posts it links to will be a great way to start.

## Android 15 Beta 1 is here, but details are still under wraps

date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News

After two months of developer previews, Google has finally released Android 15 Beta 1. While the beta usually offers more user-facing changes, Google is still pretty light on details with this build, giving us only a few more details on what we can expect. Instead, the company is pointing to Google I/O for more details, which will take place on May 14 this year, basically confirming that this is when we will get the second beta with more features. ↫ Manuel Vonau There&#8217;s very little of interest in this beta, so unless you&#8217;re really into Android development, I&#8217;d wait out installing any betas until after Google I/O.

## Greenmask v0.1.7 Release

date: 2024-04-12, from: PostgreSQL News

<h1>Greenmask v0.1.7 Release</h1>
<h2>PostgreSQL Dump and Obfuscation Tool</h2>
<p>This release introduces a new Greenmask command, improvements, bug fixes, and documentation updates.</p>
<h1>Greenmask Overview</h1>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-platform</strong> — can be easily built and executed on any platform, thanks to its Go-based architecture,
  which eliminates platform dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong> - allows to check the transformation result and show problems if any using the single command <code>validate</code></li>
<li><strong>Schema difference check</strong> - validate your current database with the previous dump in storage and show diff</li>
<li><strong>Database type safe</strong> — ensures data integrity by validating data and utilizing the database driver for
  encoding and decoding operations. This approach guarantees the preservation of data formats.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation validation and easy maintainable</strong> — during obfuscation development, Greenmask provides validation warnings and a transformation diff feature, allowing you to monitor and maintain transformations effectively throughout the software lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Partitioned tables transformation inheritance</strong> — define transformation configurations once and apply them to all partitions within partitioned tables, simplifying the obfuscation process.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless</strong> — Greenmask operates as a logical dump and does not impact your existing database schema.</li>
<li><strong>Backward compatible</strong> — it fully supports the same features and protocols as existing vanilla PostgreSQL utilities. Dumps created by Greenmask can be successfully restored using the pg_restore utility.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible</strong> — users have the flexibility to implement domain-based transformations in any programming language or use predefined templates.</li>
<li><strong>Declarative</strong> — Greenmask allows you to define configurations in a structured, easily parsed, and recognizable format.</li>
<li><strong>Integrable</strong> — integrate Greenmask seamlessly into your CI/CD system for automated database obfuscation and restoration.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel execution</strong> — take advantage of parallel dumping and restoration, significantly reducing the time required to deliver results.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a variety of storage</strong> — Greenmask offers a variety of storage options for local and remote data storage, including directories and S3-like storage solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Greenmask is ideally suited for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Routine backup and restoration tasks, ensuring data integrity and availability.</li>
<li>Anonymization and data masking for staging environments and analytics, protecting sensitive information while maintaining data utility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<h3>v0.1.7</h3>
<h5>New features</h5>
<ul>
<li>Added restoration filtering by <code>--table</code>, <code>--schema</code> and <code>--exclude-schema</code> parameters</li>
<li>Validate command without parameters validates only the configuration file</li>
<li>Added the <code>--schema</code> parameter, which allows to make a schema diff between the previous dump and the current. This 
  is useful when you want to check if the schema has changed after the migration. By controlling it we can exclude 
  data leakage after migration</li>
<li>Validate command divided by many stages that can be controlled using parameters<ul>
<li>Configuration validation</li>
<li>Transformer validation</li>
<li>Constraint violation check</li>
<li>Data difference check</li>
<li>Schema difference check</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li>Improved Hash transformer <ul>
<li>Added salt parameter that can be set via config or via <code>GREENMASK_GLOBAL_SALT</code></li>
<li>Added sha3 functions support in different modes (sha3-224, sha3-256, sha3-384, sha3-512)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactored <code>Cmd</code> transformer logic<ul>
<li>Json API: Now it allows to use of column names instead of column indexes in JSON format</li>
<li>Csv API: Now it can use the column order from config via column remapping</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>validate</code> command was rewritten almost from scratch.<ul>
<li>New option <code>--transformed-only</code> - displays only columns that are transformed with a primary key (if exists). This
  allows to reduce the output data and make it more readable</li>
<li>Implemented <code>json</code> format for output</li>
<li>Added the <code>--table-format</code> parameter which is responsible for the <code>vertical</code> and <code>horizontal</code> table orientation.
  This works only when <code>--format=text</code></li>
<li>Added the <code>--warnings</code> parameter, if it is specified then not only fatal-warnings will be displayed, but also
  those with a lower severity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Fixed <code>--use-list</code> option - now it applies to entries according to the order in the list file</li>
<li>Fixed <code>--use-list</code> option behavior together with <code>--list-format</code> option (<code>json</code> or <code>text</code>). Now it
  generates a temporal list file in text format for providing it to the pg_restore call</li>
<li>Updated documentation according to the latest changes</li>
</ul>
<h3>v0.1.2 - v0.1.6</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed uncontrolled buffer growth in the restore command</li>
<li>The <code>Hash</code> transformer has been completely remastered and now has the <code>function</code> parameter to choose from several hash algorithm options and the <code>max_length</code> parameter to truncate the hash tail.</li>
<li>Split information about transformers between the <code>list-transformers</code> and new <code>show-transformer</code> CLI commands, which allows for more comprehensible and useful outputs for both commands </li>
<li>Added error severity for the <code>Cmd</code> parameter validator</li>
<li>Significantly refactored the structure and content of documentation</li>
<li>Fixed metadata enrichment for validation warnings caused by <code>RawValueValidator</code></li>
<li>Fixed a typo in the <code>credit_card</code> value for the <code>type</code> parameter of the <code>Masking</code> transformer</li>
<li>Fixed Greenmask Playground environment variables and the <code>cleanup</code> command</li>
<li>Fixed <code>list-dump</code>, <code>list-transformers</code>, and <code>restore</code> commands exit code on error</li>
<li>Fixed database connection parameters behavior fields</li>
<li>Fixed Json transformer: now it correctly parses operations field</li>
<li>Fixed bug when raw COPY lines were parsed incorrectly</li>
<li>Fixed <code>--version</code> parameter behavior</li>
</ul>

## My 1988 driver's license

date: 2024-04-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Found this in my desk drawer today. Amazing the things you carry with you over the ages. I lived in an apartment building on top of a hill in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1100+Sharon+Park+Dr,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.424696,-122.2298177,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fa4f7ba716f5d:0x4318060066990628!8m2!3d37.4247727!4d-122.2181447!16s%2Fg%2F11c1343h_f?entry=ttu">middle of a golf course</a>, smack in the heart of Silicon Valley, if it actually had a heart, and that's debatable. All the Sand Hill Road VCs were on the other side of the hill. And one exit south on 280 was Xerox PARC, and where NeXT had its startup offices. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/11/driverslicensesmall1988.png"></center>My 1988 driver's license.</div></p>
<p>This was the place where I started development of what became <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. I always wanted to do a great system level scripting thing, based on what I learned from Unix and what I loved about the graphic user interface. </p>
<p>It became a lot bigger than I anticipated. In the beginning it was meant to be a replacement for the Macintosh Finder, with an outliner for a file system browser, and of course a fantastic scripting ability, of the OS and of scriptable apps. I wish Apple had supported this effort but I didn't understand at the time that they couldn't. They weren't set up to let anyone but Bill and Andy make great products, even if their products weren't all that great, imho of course. You have to live with the mythology you create. </p>
<p>A lot of people got their first programming experience with Hypercard. I would have loved if more of them get their first experience with Frontier. Even better would have been if our products worked together, but that wasn't in the cards either. </p>

## GNU Hurd ported to AArch64, and more Hurd news

date: 2024-04-11, from: OS News

Hurd, the kernel that is supposed to form the basis of the GNU operating system, is perpetually a research project that doesn&#8217;t get anywhere close to being a replacement for Linux, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the project doesn&#8217;t make progress and has a place in the world of operating systems. Their most recent major improvement has been porting GNU Hurd to AArch64, spearheaded by Hurd developer Sergey Bugaev. Since then, however, I have been (some may say, relentlessly) working on filling in the missing piece, namely porting GNU Mach (with important help &#38; contributions by Luca D.). I am happy to report that we now have an experimental port of GNU Mach that builds and works on AArch64! While that may sound impressive, note that various things about it are in an extremely basic, proof-of-concept state rather than being seriously production-ready; and also that Mach is a small kernel (indeed, a microkernel), and it was designed from the start (back in the 80s) to be portable, so most of the &#8220;buisness logic&#8221; functionality (virtual memory, IPC, tasks/threads/scheduler) is explicitly arch-independent. Despite the scary &#8220;WIP proof-of-concept&#8221; status, there is enough functionality in Mach to run userland code, handle exceptions and syscalls, interact with the MMU to implement all the expected virtual memory semantics, schedule/switch tasks and threads, and so on. Moreover, all of GNU Mach&#8217;s userspace self-tests pass! ↫ Sergey Bugaev On top of all this, glibc works on the AArch64 port, and several important Hurd servers work as well, namely ext2fs, exec, startup, auth, and proc, as a do a number of basic UNIX programs. This is an exceptional effort, and highlights that while people tend to make fun of Hurd, it&#8217;s got some real talent working on it that bring the platform forward. While we may not see any widely usable release any time soon, every bit of progress helps and is welcome. Speaking of progress, the progress report for GNU Hurd covering the first quarter of 2024 has also been published, and it lists a number of other improvements and fixes made aside from the AArch64 port. For instance, the console will now use xkbcommon instead of X11 for handling keyboard layouts, which reduced code complexity a lot and improved keyboard layout coverage, to boot. The port of GDB to the 64 bit version of Hurd is also progressing, and SMP has seen a ton of fixes too. Another awesome bit of news comes from, once again, Sergey Bugaev, as he announced a new Hurd distribution based on Alpine Linux. Work on this project has only recently begun, but he&#8217;s already had some success and about 299 Alpine packages are available. His reasons for starting this new project is that while Debian GNU/Hurd is a great base to work from for Hurd users and developers, Debian is also a bit strict and arcane in its packaging requirements, which might make sense for Debian GNU/Linux, but is annoying to work with when you&#8217;re trying to get a lot of low-level work done. For now, there&#8217;s no name yet, and he&#8217;s asking for help from the Hurd community for name ideas, hosting, and so on. That&#8217;s a lot of GNU Hurd progress this quarter, and that&#8217;s good news.

## Humane AI pins review confirm what we already expected: it’s useless trash

date: 2024-04-11, from: OS News

I didn&#8217;t want to spend too much time on this thing, but I feel like we can all use a good laugh at a stupid product hyped only by the tech media. The Verge reviewed the Humane AI pin, and entirely predictably, it&#8217;s a complete and utter trashfire. But until all of that happens, and until the whole AI universe gets better, faster, and more functional, the AI Pin isn’t going to feel remotely close to being done. It’s a beta test, a prototype, a proof of concept that maybe someday there might be a killer device that does all of these things. I know with absolute certainty that the AI Pin is not that device. It’s not worth $700, or $24 a month, or all the time and energy and frustration that using it requires. It’s an exciting idea and an infuriating product.&#160; AI gadgets might one day be great. But this isn’t that day, and the AI Pin isn’t that product. I’ll take my phone back now, thanks. ↫ David Pierce at The Verge It takes dozens of seconds to reply to any query, the battery is severely lacking, the answers you get are mostly wrong or useless, sending text messages is effectively broken, and tons of promised features don&#8217;t work because they&#8217;re not implemented. In another video review, MrMobile also shows the device overheating all the time, a problem that&#8217;s common to all of the devices. I don&#8217;t think trashfire is harsh enough to describe this junk.

## So it begins: Microsoft starts showing full-screen ads about the end of Windows 10 support

date: 2024-04-11, from: OS News

We are about 18 months away from the end of mainstream Windows 10 support, but Microsoft thinks it is time to start nagging warning Windows 10 users about the inevitable. Users on Reddit report spotting a new full-screen ad with a notification that Windows 10 is about to reach its end of life in October 2025, even though it is still getting new features (there are even rumors about Microsoft re-opening the Windows Insider Program for Windows 10). ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I mean, I have a long history of crying foul over Windows being adware now, but I don&#8217;t think warning users that their operating system is losing support and that they should upgrade to a new version really constitutes an ad. Sure, technically it does, but I think we can all agree that such a warning is useful and informative.

## Lately

date: 2024-04-11, from: Rachel Kwon blog

I&rsquo;ve been a little less online lately, but not to worry, I have just been living my life :)
Several weeks ago, I gave notice at work and left. Some people in my life were surprised, because it was a good job at a good company, I generally enjoyed it, I got to work with wonderful people, and I was paid money to do it. The younger version of me who hadn&rsquo;t yet figured out a career direction would be curious (and more than a little skeptical) about why I would quit such an objectively good job.

## Me and FSD

date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Check out my <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html">political preamble</a> on Tesla, X and Musk. </p>
<p>One more disclaimer: I love my Tesla Model Y. Best car ever. I've been driving a Tesla since late 2021, and I still feel privileged to drive the car every time I do. It's the Macintosh of cars.</p>
<p>I don't generally use <a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html">FSD</a>, even though I paid for it and have had it available all the time I've driven a Tesla.</p>
<p>They say you should always be fully attentive when using FSD. I am always <i>soooo</i> ready to take over for it. I don't trust it. And I also don't feel that when I'm in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-knuckle">white-knuckle</a> mode when it's driving, that my reflexes are anywhere near as good as the reflexes I have when I'm driving, with fifty years of experience, and maybe a few hours of experience supervising a FSD car. I don't have a sense of how to work with it. So I err on the side of turning it off whenever I feel like even slightly scared. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I also don't like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster">roller coasters</a>, but if I did, I'd recognize that this is different. A roller coaster is designed to give the exact same experience to every user every time. It's designed to give the impression that your life is about to end, using gravity and eyesight and all that evolution trained you to be scared of. It fools you into being scared, when you're actually safe. Every so often you read about someone dying on a rollercoaster. That probably improves the fun for thrill-seekers, and gives people like me justification for staying away. People also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping">bungee jump</a> knowing there's a chance the chord could break, but they know it's not going to. </p>
<p>None of that is true for the Tesla. It's making it up as it goes along. And it definitely encounters situations it can't handle, or it misinterprets a set of obvious facts, or even worse it hallucinates just like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Lake+Katrine,+New+York/Woodstock,+NY/@41.9949908,-74.0943946,13z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x89dd05c97bfa4075:0xbf2d119b7e29d940!2m2!1d-73.9881934!2d41.9856476!3m4!1m2!1d-74.0796429!2d41.972964!3s0x89dd042d11d4346d:0xbe2f0b18a2064238!1m5!1m1!1s0x89dd0733c0cf4c2b:0xb85cbeef880771fc!2m2!1d-74.1181971!2d42.0409247!3e0?entry=ttu">driving</a> from Lake Katrine to Woodstock with FSD, and it was doing really well, up to a point. First I was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_28">Route 28</a>, a four-lane road, for about five miles, it <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9972259,-74.1046808,3a,75y,343.4h,68.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srkTm7bYH3qW0CqLfUyT18w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">turned</a> onto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_375">375</a> which is a curvy two-lane road. I was starting to feel slightly comfortable. Then we come up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_212">212</a>, where 375 ends. A busy <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.0369198,-74.1109242,3a,75y,19.14h,83.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJbEh3c4hgugNZsCx4uUtZw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">intersection</a>. Traffic coming from the left and right, and many are turning onto the road I'm on. I watched in awe as FSD tried to find a way to make a left turn in this complicated situation, starting, stopping, it tried, found itself out in traffic, and got stuck there. I had enough and took over. Luckily the car waiting behind us had left a little room. I've dealt with this intersection probably a few hundred times in the last few years. I know the crazy things the other drivers do here, and I know to watch out for them. The Tesla didn't know.  </p>

## How does the classic Win32 ListView handle incremental searching?

## The native app install experience

date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><video controls preload="none" poster="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/download-app.jpg" src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/download-app.mp4"></video></p>
<p>At the end of each MSNBC YouTube video right now they have a 30 second post-roll of Ali Velshi explaining the 5-step process on how to install the new MSNBC app.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap on the App Store on your phone</li>
<li>Hit “Search” on the bottom right corner</li>
<li>Type in “MSNBC”</li>
<li>Click on the MSNBC app</li>
<li>Click on “Get” or the cloud icon</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s an implied sixth step where you need to actually open the newly installed app. Opening the app for the first time you swipe through a little slideshow that has two more (optional) steps: give your email and turn on notifications. Standard engagement economy tactics.</p>
<p>Hearing the 5-step native app install process a few times a day makes me think we lost something along the way. Remember when the call to action was to visit a URL? Not only is “Visit msnbc.com” more succinct, catchier, private, less prone to user error, and immune to competitive advertisements but it also doesn’t require a paid presenter to coach you through it. Once upon a time users might have needed Ali Velshi’s help getting to a website, but in my experience visiting a website is one of the first computing skills my kids learned without my direct involvement. The URL isn’t a foreign concept anymore.</p>
<p>I know I’m making a mountain out of a “We just want to promote our new app, maaan” molehill here, but even saying “Visit msnbc.com/mobile” with a redirect to their <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/information/msnbc-info/download-msnbc-app-n1241692">actual app download page</a> would be easier. It boggles my mind why you’d push a clunky app store install flow over a five-letter domain name. I’d even bet $5 that the “native app” is actually a bunch of web views in a trench coat. In an even wilder twist, that app download page isn’t linked anywhere on the website! Ughck. I’m 0% invested on what’s happening over at MSNBC but I’m already getting whiffs of misaligned goals, interdepartmental strife, and poorly designed content management systems.</p>
<p>Anyways, websites. They’re old tech but still work great from time to time.</p>

## EU’s new tech laws are working; small mobile browsers gain market share

date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News

Independent browser companies in the European Union are seeing a spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet&#8217;s Google, Microsoft and Apple to make it easier for users to switch to rivals, according to data provided to Reuters by six companies. The early results come after the EU&#8217;s sweeping Digital Markets Act, which aims to remove unfair competition, took effect on March 7, forcing big tech companies to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers from a &#8220;choice screen.&#8221; ↫ Supantha Mukherjee and Foo Yun Chee I can&#8217;t believe this is even remotely surprising. A lot of especially Apple fans and people from outside of the European Union complained left, right, and centre about the choice screen and how it was ugly, unnecessary, and would just confuse users. These are interesting claims, considering the fact that setting up a modern smartphone such as the iPhone takes the user through 40-50 setup screens chockful of confusing choices to make, so adding one more surely wouldn&#8217;t make a difference. Of course giving users the option to choose a different default browser would lead to an increase in browsers other than Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android) being set as the default. I&#8217;m pretty sure quite a few users learned, through the choice screen, for the first time, that there even are different browsers to choose from, and that some of those might offer features and benefits they didn&#8217;t even know they could enjoy. That&#8217;s the whole point of this endeavour: informing users that they have a choice, something Apple, Google, and others would rather you either do not have, or at least not know about. It&#8217;s far too early to tell if these spikes are a one-off thing, or if the rise in browsers other than Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android is more structural. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s the latter, and even if the numbers remain in the single digits or low double digits, it will still lead to an increase in competition, and a more vibrant mobile browser market. Good news, regardless.

## Microsoft details new features coming in Windows Server 2025

date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News

Microsoft recently held a streaming event in which it detailed a lot of the new features and changes coming in Windows server 2025, and has now followed that up with a blog post, as well. There&#8217;s a lot to go over here, and I&#8217;m anything but a Windows Server specialist, so I&#8217;ll highlight some of the thing I&#8217;m certain will be welcomed by Windows Server administrators. First and foremost, the biggest improvement: hot-patching. Security updates can be installed without having to reboot, because Server 2025 will modify code in memory without restarting the processes in question. Quarterly updates, however, will still require reboots. Hot-patching will be free on all versions of Server 2025. Microsoft also promises a massive performance boost for NVMe drives &#8211; the company claims a 70% improvement going from Server 2022 to Server 2025. Microsoft&#8217;s other file system, ReFS, is also seeing improvements, and Storage Replica&#8217;s compression will be available in all editions of Windows Server 2025. A major improvement in Hyper-V is the ability to partition GPUs, so you can use one GPU to power multiple virtual machines. As far as licensing goes, the most important news here is that you&#8217;ll still be able to buy a normal, regular, run-of-the-mill perpetual license for Windows Server 2025, so even though there&#8217;s various more &#8216;modern&#8217; options, you can also just opt for the way it&#8217;s always been.

## A weighted vest

date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Rupert blog

<picture style="margin-inline: auto">
  <source srcset="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/vest-dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
  <img alt="Illustration of a large round man with a tiny vest in the middle of his chest" src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/vest.svg" width="461" height="429" >
</picture>
<p>I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/3xsz1Xj">a 40 pound weighted vest for $40 dollars on Amazon</a>. The workout term for this is “rucking” and has connotations with being outdoorsy and/or in the military. Load up a backpack full of weights (or in my case, a vest full of sand bags) and head outdoors. The <a href="https://www.goruck.com/pages/what-is-rucking">marketing benefits</a> of rucking sound great:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is simple and anyone can do it</li>
<li>Gets you outside</li>
<li>Active Resistance Training™️</li>
<li>Burns up to 3x more calories than walking</li>
<li>Good for your back and improves your posture</li>
<li>Good for your mental health</li>
</ul>
<p>A neighbor friend of mine (that’s also a physical therapist) has one and she recommended it.  My body is adept at carrying heavy objects<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, so this seems like an easy way to squeeze out some gains from my regular walks. Bonus points that it gets me outside and gets rid of my developer hunch. After a handful of walks, I’m enjoying the vest and –as expected– my body handles the weight fine but it’s sweatier and hills knock the wind out of me a bit more.</p>
<p>There’s an army fetish around rucking. It’s hard to tell if that’s fragile male ego in workout culture or if it’s because an armored plate carrier is a well-tested and efficient way to carry weight. My vest doesn’t look that masculine and looks more like I duct taped C4 to my chest. With my uni-bomber glasses, long hair, beard, and resting scowl I don’t need more help looking like a disgruntled domestic terrorist but I suppose this completes the look. If I can sustain <a href="/2021/06/two-options/">the $40 fix</a>, then I’ll upgrade to the $200 plate vest solution.</p>
<p>The cynical side of me wonders if this is more skinny people shit. As I dawn the weighted vest, the irony is not lost on me I used to be about the same amount of weight heavier. Being heavy never helped me lose weight. No one gives you an approving head nod for walking while fat, but velcro a little vest to your torso and people give you the “good for you” pity eyes.</p>
<p>Putting my optimist hat back on, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po4adxJxqZk">it might work this time</a>. Maybe this is the one weird trick my body needs to activate dormant caveman genetics that will unleash my inner Adonis. Walking in hard mode seems sustainable for the time-being and I can already feel my ass morphing into a perfect badonkadonk.</p>

They have all kinds of links that say click here to pay the thing you want to pay, and that just takes me to a login page where it says someone with that email address already has an account, which I knew because I'm already logged in using that account. The IRS site was a comparative breeze, even though it had its own mysteries to solve and a certain amount of luck was required to be allowed to pay my freaking taxes. I think when Reagan said the government was the problem this is one of the times he was right about that.

## Maldives 2024

date: 2024-04-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="maldives-2024">Maldives 2024</h1>

<p>The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.</p>

<p>The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane, Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the <a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible, too.</p>

<p>With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in 2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to the Maldives.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-06</strong>.
The last leg of the journey – our water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the reef begins a few meters in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10 before we left.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to hide in the sand.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in Australia or the Galapagos.
This purple giant is cool, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are still plenty of colourful fish.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games.
The most popular tropical island game is Race for the Galaxy.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday we also played <a href="http://mixedsignals.ml/games/petition/">Petition</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@klaatu" title="@klaatu@mastodon.xyz">@klaatu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.</p>

<p>We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily scared and therefore obviously harmless.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.</p>

<p>There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work on the tourist islands.</p>

<p>The capital city is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a> book. Check out these stats from the <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia page on the Maldives</a>:
In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement from the point of view of the locals.</p>

<p>From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don&rsquo;t know what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in the the fish. People eat the fish. It&rsquo;s easy to feel grim about this. I need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much, much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look away.</p>

## “Why does part of the Windows 98 Setup program look older than the rest?”

date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News

Well, this is something I never knew. Over on the retrocomputing section of StackExchange, someone asked why the second phase of the Windows 98 installation looked decidedly different from the third phase, even though they&#8217;re both graphical phases (the first phase is textual). The answer turns out to be both surprising, and entirely predictable. The first phase is a DOS program called DOSSETUP.BIN, which is the infamous blue part of the installation. The second part, however, is what we&#8217;re interested in here, and if the first phase is DOS, and the third phase is Windows 98 itself&#8230; What do you think the second phase is running? Yeah, exactly. Basically, because it is running under Windows 3.1 at that point. The second uses this minimal Windows 3.1 to run a Windows 3 program, W98SETUP.BIN (specified as the “shell” in SYSTEM.INI). This starts by copying more files to support all the information-gathering during setup, and various other niceties including the 3D look shown in your screenshot (the contents of the PRECOPY CABs); it ends by copying most of Windows 98, setting the system up so that it will boot Windows 98 from the target drive, and rebooting. ↫ Stephen Kitt So, in order to install Windows 98, you first run DOS, followed by Windows 3.1, ending in Windows 98. I have no idea why this is so funny to me, especially since it fits entirely within expectations of how Microsoft does things.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

For me, using FSD in my Tesla is like riding a roller coaster. I don't trust the car not to kill me though. I spend most of my working life dealing with bugs in software. It's very easy for me to imagine what could go wrong. I don't understand how people can trust a computer with their lives this way. It's also disconcerting that the car coming at me in the other direction could be computer-driven. And nowadays when I see the other car is a Tesla, esp this month when everyone's getting a free demo of FSD, it's somewhat likely the OP is a computer.

## On video podcasts

date: 2024-04-10, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p><a href="https://robhope.com/">Rob</a> has a <a href="https://yo.fm/">podcast</a>. It started way back in 2019—damn time flies—and season 3 just started. If you’re into tech/design give it a listen. But Rob’s podcast is just the excuse I needed to complain about something I find quite annoying: video podcasts.</p>
<p>Season 3 of Yo! is “video first”. Podcasts switching to video to be on YouTube ranks quite high on the list of things that I find annoying. I get why they’re doing it. I’m not an idiot. Yet I still find it annoying. Especially because podcasts that were audio-only would start referencing and talking about things that are “on the screen right now” and now I’m missing out on parts of the conversation because I’m listening to a podcast while I’m driving.</p>
<p>Video podcasts are the worst of both worlds. They’re not as good as actual video content designed to be consumed exclusively as video and they’re inferior to audio-only podcasts. And if you disagree <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">let me know why</a>.</p>                <hr>

## Deep Bug

date: 2024-04-10, from: Marginallia log

The project has been haunted by a mysterious bug since sometime February. It relates to the code that constructs the index, particularly the code that merges partial indices.
In short the search engine constucts the reverse index through successive merging of smaller indices, which reduces the overall memory requirement.
You can conceptualize the revese index itself as two files, one with offset pointers into another file, which has sorted numbers. This code runs after each partition finishes crawling and processing its data, and has a run time of about 4 hours.

## iXsystems: focusing on Linux makes more sense than FreeBSD

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

A few weeks ago we talked about how iXsystems, the company behind TrueNAS CORE and SCALE, has all but confirmed that its FreeBSD-based CORE product will be put in maintenance mode, while the Linux-based SCALE product will get all the attention and focus from here on out. In an interview with Blocks &#38; Files, the company gave more insight into this choice. “We had a huge chunk of our engineering staff spending time improving FreeBSD as opposed to working on features and functionalities. What’s happened now with the transition to having a Debian basis, the people I used to have 90 percent of their time working on FreeBSD, they’re working on ZFS features now … That’s what I want to see; value add for everybody versus sitting around, implementing something Linux had a years ago. And trying to maintain or backport, or just deal with something that you just didn’t get out of box on FreeBSD.” “It’s not knocking against FreeBSD. We love it. That’s our heritage. That’s our roots, I was on the CORE team elected twice. So believe me, if I felt like I could have stayed on FreeBSD for the next 20 years, I would have absolutely preferred to do that … But at some point, you gotta read the writing on the wall and say, well, all the the vendor supported-innovations are happening on the Linux side these days.”  BSD aficionados don’t like this change. Moore said: “Talk is cheap and complaints are free. You know, everyone loves to complain about it. But … if people wanted to push FreeBSD forward for the last 15 years, they would have.” ↫ Chris Mellor at Blocks &#38; Files Above all else, my personal north star is choice, especially in technology, and as such, I want iXsystems to keep focusing on FreeBSD so that not everyone is using Linux for server- and server-like workloads. The fact that TrueNAS was a FreeBSD-based product for this long was amazing, and I would definitely have preferred if it stayed that way for many, many more years to come. However, I don&#8217;t think the people of TrueNAS are saying anything wrong or outrageous here. They&#8217;ve got employees to feed, and the money is in Linux, not FreeBSD. If they spend more money, time, and resources on getting FreeBSD on par with features Linux has had for ages than on actually developing their own product &#8211; TrueNAS &#8211; then they&#8217;re fighting a losing battle. Honestly, I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s taken them this long to take this controversial step. All we can hope for is that the things they work on, the features they develop, will make it to FreeBSD regardless.

## HP 200LX and related palmtops

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

The HP 200 LX was a successful palmtop computer introduced in 1994. HP continued to sell it through 1999, an unusually long run for a 1990s computer model. In this blog post, we’ll dig into this largely forgotten form factor and why it became such a quiet success. ↫ Dave Farquhar These devices are incredibly cool, but I disagree that they disappeared, as the blog post states. Just recently I reviewed my main laptop, a very small Chuwi MiniBook (2023) with the N100, and in that article I also listed some other similar options that are still being made and sold today, from companies like GPD and OneNetbook.

## Beeper leaves beta, acquired by Automattic

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

If you haven’t already heard of Beeper, welcome! Beeper is a universal chat app for Android, iOS and desktop. Our goal is to build the best chat app on earth.  Beeper is built on an open source chat protocol called Matrix. Over time, we’ll help people migrate from proprietary, siloed chat networks to an open standard for chat. If you’re interested in learning about this, we’ve written more about our intentions. ↫ Beeper team Beeper is just great. Because I&#8217;m European and have ties to two different countries with vastly different chat preferences, as well as a number of friends living all over Europe and the US, I&#8217;ve always had to deal with at least four different instant messaging applications. Beeper, and especially the recent completely redesigned Android version, is so good and seamless that I no longer need to use the individual applications at all. It&#8217;s not perfect &#8211; the new Android version (the iOS version is old and outdated compared to the Android one) still has some issues. If you receive a video and play it, it doesn&#8217;t maximise unless you perform a very delicate zoom in pinch. Sometimes, sending video fails. Some emoji replies on some services look huge and pixellated. I&#8217;m sure these are all relatively low-hanging fruit types of bugs that&#8217;ll get fixes over the coming weeks and months now that the application is out of beta. However, the actual core of the application has been working amazingly well for me. Beeper also has another major announcement. I’m excited to announce that Beeper has been acquired by Automattic. This acquisition marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter as we continue our mission to create the best chat app on earth. ↫ Eric Migicovsky Automattic is the company behind WordPress, Tumblr, Pocket Casts, and a whole load of other products and services. Beeper seems like a good fit, since Automattic recently also acquired Texts.com, another multi-platform messaging client.

## Google details privacy and security features of its new Find My Device network

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

Yesterday, I posted an item about the updated Find My Device network Google launched for Android, but I forgot to link to an additional blog post by Google about the various security and privacy precautions they&#8217;ve taken. One aspect in particular stands out as something new that Apple&#8217;s Find My network doesn&#8217;t do (yet): This is a first-of-its-kind safety protection that makes unwanted tracking to a private location, like your home, more difficult. By default, the Find My Device network requires multiple nearby Android devices to detect a tag before reporting its location to the tag&#8217;s owner. Our research found that the Find My Device network is most valuable in public settings like cafes and airports, where there are likely many devices nearby. By implementing aggregation before showing a tag’s location to its owner, the network can take advantage of its biggest strength – over a billion Android devices that can participate. This helps tag owners find their lost devices in these busier locations while prioritizing safety from unwanted tracking near private locations. In less busy areas, last known location and Nest finding are reliable ways to locate items. ↫ Dave Kleidermacher In addition, when you&#8217;re at home, your devices won&#8217;t contribute any information either. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of other things in there, too, so head on over if you&#8217;re curious.

## On Tesla, Nazis, X and the Macintosh of cars

date: 2024-04-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm not sure I'd buy a Tesla today because of Musk's politics which he puts in our face, thus influencing other people to inflict their nightmares on us. I bet in the end Musk will be responsible for a lot of people dying. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I love the car, and thus love the people who developed it, who I don't know. I hope they're not Nazis. I don't see how someone who could design such a thing as a Tesla Model Y, in <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/19/140204.html?title=myNewTesla">2021</a>, the year I bought mine, could be anything like that. </p>
<p>This car is going to be copied. There will be a generation of cars that comes along, some that have not arrived yet, that will have to stand up to a comparison to a Tesla. This is the original. </p>
<p>To be alive when such a product comes out and not own one, that would be hard for me to do. I don't think my "support" of Tesla could mean that much. The money is already spent. It costs nothing to maintain the car (one of its innovations). </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/09/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It's like the Macintosh of cars. I would have owned a Macintosh in 1984 even if I wasn't one of Apple's top developers. I also know that Steve Jobs didn't design the machine, he stole it from people at Xerox who did. Apple refined the idea, made it practical, like a Tesla, commercial. That's a huge accomplishment, commercializing and humanizing a concept like the Mac was harder than inventing, imho. I have a feeling that Tesla must stand on the shoulders of giants in a similar way. </p>
<p>Tesla is always sending me emails, which I usually read, but last week I got one urging me to join X. I thought what bullshit. I don't want these products connected. There was a time, not that long ago, that I would have thought a car hooked up to Twitter as a fantastic and futuristic idea, but now, I think it means no one of principle, certainly no one who is a target of Nazis could work at Tesla in the future. And those are some of the brightest people out there. </p>
<p>Meanwhile I'm looking at other company's EVs with lust. I might like a Kia or a BMW. If you're making a consumer product, Nazi branding is not a good look. And X is becoming a stinker too. </p>
<p>PS: I was inspired to write this piece by one written by <a href="https://werd.io/">Ben Wurdmuller</a> <a href="https://werd.io/2024/i-tried-tesla-fsd">posted yesterday</a>. I've had much the same feeling about <a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html">FSD</a>. This piece started out to be about FSD, but the preamble, like the one in his piece, got so long I decided to post it first as its own piece. </p>

## Making Ultra-fast Electron Measurements in Multiple Directions to Reveal the Secrets of the Aurora

date: 2024-04-09, from: NASA breaking news

The energetic electrons that drive the aurora borealis (the northern lights) have a rich and very dynamic structure that we currently do not fully understand.  Much of what we know about these electrons comes from instruments that have fundamental limitations in their ability to sample multiple energies with high time resolution. To overcome these limitations, NASA is using an innovative approach to develop instrumentation that will enhance our measurement capabilities by more than an order of magnitude—revealing a wealth of new information about the amazing physics happening within the aurora.

## Ten years ago, Windows XP received its final update

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

Exactly ten years ago, on April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the final security patch for Windows XP. The day marked the end of the road for one of the most iconic Windows versions ever released. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I never liked Windows XP. Compared to the operating systems I was using at the time &#8211; BeOS, Mandrake Linux 8.x &#8211; Windows XP felt kind of like a bad joke I wasn&#8217;t in on. It looked ridiculous, didn&#8217;t seem to offer anything substantial, and it didn&#8217;t take long for major security incidents related to Windows XP to start dominating the news. It wasn&#8217;t until several service packs had been released that Windows XP came into its own, but by that point, I had already found a much better alternative for my Windows needs at the time. I&#8217;m of course talking about Windows Server 2003, the better Windows than Windows XP. Today though, I do have an odd fondness for Windows XP, as I grow older and XP has become something from my teenage years. The look and feel of Windows XP &#8211; the classic theme, not that horrendous Fisher Price nonsense &#8211; the sound set, the wallpaper of course &#8211; has become iconic, warts and all, and whole generations of people will feel instant feelings as soon as they see Bliss or hear that iconic startup sound. Windows XP with a few service packs now belongs to the small group of Windows releases that I would call the peak of the platform, together with Windows 95 and Windows 7 (and perhaps Server 2003, but that&#8217;s more of a personal thing and not a consumer operating system). Everything else has not exactly been great or even aged well, and I doubt Windows 10 and 11 will suddenly get good, either.

## Google launches Axion processors, new Arm-based CPUs for the data centre

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

Built using the Arm Neoverse™ V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant leaps in performance for general-purpose workloads like web and app servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training and inferencing, and more. Axion is underpinned by Titanium, a system of purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out offloads. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads storage I/O processing to Hyperdisk, our new block storage service that decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically provisioned in real time. ↫ Amin Vahdat on the Google blog Fancy new ARM processors from Google, designed explicitly for the data centre. In other words, we&#8217;ll never get to play with it unless one makes its way to eBay in a few years.

## Embedding the Servo web engine in Qt

date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve been talking about Servo, the Rust browser engine project originally started at Mozilla, for a while now, and while the project&#8217;s still got a long way to go, it&#8217;s definitely a serious contender to become a competitive browser engine in the future. It seems it&#8217;s starting to get some traction already, as The KDAB Group is working on bringing Servo to Qt. At KDAB we managed to embed the Servo web engine inside Qt, by using our CXX-Qt library as a bridge between Rust and C++. This means that we can now use Servo as an alternative to Chromium for webviews in Qt applications. ↫ Andrew Hayzen and Magnus Groß They&#8217;re already showing off a basic QML application rendering websites using Servo, which is pretty cool. It goes to show that Servo can definitely eventually fulfill the role that Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko fulfill now.

<li><a href="https://github.com/Brick-Abode/pldotnet/wiki/pldotnet:-White-Paper">Our whitepaper</a></li>
</ul>
<p>More details below.</p>
<h2>Usage example</h2>
<p>pl/dotnet gives you the full power of C# and F# in your PostgreSQL
procedures, functions, and triggers.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dynamic_record_generator_srf(lim INT8)  
RETURNS SETOF record  
AS $$  
    upperLimit = lim.HasValue ? lim : System.Int32.MaxValue;  
    for(long i=0;i&lt;upperLimit;i++){ yield return new object?[] { i, $"Number is {i}" }; }  
$$ LANGUAGE plcsharp;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dynamic_record_generator_srf_fsharp(lim INT8)  
RETURNS SETOF record  
AS $$  
    let upperLimit = Option.defaultValue (int64 System.Int32.MaxValue) lim  
    seq { for i in 0L .. upperLimit - 1L do yield [| box i; $"Number is {i}" |] }  
$$ LANGUAGE plfsharp;
</code></pre>
<h2>SQL features</h2>
<p>We support all SQL function modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>normal procedures and functions</li>
<li>trigger functions, will full trigger support: trigger arguments, old/new row, row rewriting (where allowed), and all the standard trigger information</li>
<li>set-returning functions, nicely mapped to iterators in C# and sequences in F#</li>
<li>table functions, as well as functions returning records or sets of records</li>
<li>full support for IN/OUT/INOUT functions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data type support</h2>
<p>We support 40 PostgreSQL types, with all mapped to their NPGSQL-standard dotnet types.
The only notable exceptions are multirange, enum, and struct types, which we hope
to add in the future.  All datatypes are nullable, have full array support, and
are fully unit-tested for C# and F#.  (Formatted as a list of (PostgreSQL
type: Dotnet type) instead of a table for technical reasons.)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bit</code>: <code>BitArray</code></li>
<li><code>bool</code>: <code>Bool</code></li>
<li><code>box</code>: <code>NpgsqlBox</code></li>
<li><code>bpchar</code>: <code>String</code></li>
<li><code>bytea</code>: <code>Byte[]</code></li>
<li><code>cidr</code>: <code>(IPAddress Address, Int Netmask)</code></li>
<li><code>circle</code>: <code>NpgsqlCircle</code></li>
<li><code>date</code>: <code>DateOnly</code></li>
<li><code>daterange</code>: <code>NpgsqlRange&lt;DateOnly&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>float4</code>: <code>Float</code></li>
<li><code>float8</code>: <code>Double</code></li>
<li><code>inet</code>: <code>(IPAddress Address, Int Netmask)</code></li>
<li><code>int2</code>: <code>Short</code></li>
<li><code>int4</code>: <code>Int</code></li>
<li><code>int4range</code>: <code>NpgsqlRange&lt;Int&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>int8</code>: <code>Long</code></li>
<li><code>int8range</code>: <code>NpgsqlRange&lt;Long&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>interval</code>: <code>NpgsqlInterval</code></li>
<li><code>json</code>: <code>String</code></li>
<li><code>line</code>: <code>NpgsqlLine</code></li>
<li><code>lseg</code>: <code>NpgsqlLSeg</code></li>
<li><code>macaddr8</code>: <code>PhysicalAddress</code></li>
<li><code>macaddr</code>: <code>PhysicalAddress</code></li>
<li><code>money</code>: <code>Decimal</code></li>
<li><code>path</code>: <code>NpgsqlPath</code></li>
<li><code>point</code>: <code>NpgsqlPoint</code></li>
<li><code>polygon</code>: <code>NpgsqlPolygon</code></li>
<li><code>record</code>: <code>Object?[]</code></li>
<li><code>text</code>: <code>String</code></li>
<li><code>timestamp</code>: <code>DateTime</code></li>
<li><code>timestamptz</code>: <code>DateTime</code></li>
<li><code>time</code>: <code>TimeOnly</code></li>
<li><code>timetz</code>: <code>DateTimeOffset</code></li>
<li><code>tsrange</code>: <code>NpgsqlRange&lt;DateTime&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>tstzrange</code>: <code>NpgsqlRange&lt;DateTime&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>uuid</code>: <code>Guid</code></li>
<li><code>varbit</code>: <code>BitArray</code></li>
<li><code>varchar</code>: <code>String</code></li>
<li><code>void</code>: <code>Void</code></li>
<li><code>xml</code>: <code>String</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>SPI</h2>
<p>Our SPI leverages the NPGSQL client library to provide a native dotnet
implementation which is maximally compatible with existing client code.
We intercepted the NPGSQL calls at a very low level to replace the
client protocol handling with SPI calls; otherwise, NPGSQL was unmodified.
We imported the NPGSQL test suite as stored procedures and are using
it for our testing, giving us very good understanding of our compatiblity
level.</p>
<p>Work remains to improve the compatibility and add features.
Our biggest category of NPGSQL tests that continue to fail is error
mapping, because SPI throws exceptions differently than NPGSQL does.
Such incompatibilities are minor but numerous; we continue working to
improve them.</p>
<p>Here are our currently tested SPI operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Manipulation Language (DML) Operations<ul>
<li>Select</li>
<li>Insert</li>
<li>Update</li>
<li>Delete</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Definition Language (DDL) Operations<ul>
<li>Create Table</li>
<li>Alter Table</li>
<li>Drop Table</li>
<li>Truncate</li>
<li>Create Index</li>
<li>Drop Index</li>
<li>Create View</li>
<li>Drop View</li>
<li>Create Function</li>
<li>Call Function</li>
<li>Drop Function</li>
<li>Create Procedure</li>
<li>Call Procedure</li>
<li>Drop Procedure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transaction Control<ul>
<li>Begin Transaction</li>
<li>Commit</li>
<li>Rollback</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supported Data Types: all pl/dotnet types<ul>
<li>Basic types (including ranges)</li>
<li>Array types</li>
<li>Record</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we don't have</h2>
<p>We lack support for multirange, enum, and composite/table types.  We intend to add them.</p>
<p>Our SPI implementation lacks some minor features like sub-transactions, and we sometimes raise errors in a different (and therefore slightly incompatible) way from NPGSQL.</p>
<p>Our build system, with both dpkg and binary output, is functional but not as tidy as we would like.</p>
<p>We welcome code submissions to address any of these issues, and we hope to improve them all in time.</p>
<h2>Where to get it</h2>
<p>Our operating system support:</p>
<ul>
<li>We fully support Linux and provide dpkg's for Debian and Ubuntu.  (Details on our <a href="https://pldotnet.brickabode.com/how-to-install-pl-net">installation page</a>)</li>
<li>We have built and tested the system on OSX (arm and x86), but we have not packaged it yet.</li>
<li>We look forward to having Windows support soon; ping us if you would like to help.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Getting in touch</h1>
<p>We welcome hearing from the community.  You can reach us at our <a href="https://github.com/Brick-Abode/pldotnet/discussions">GitHub discussion forum</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:pldotnet@brickabode.com">pldotnet@brickabode.com</a>.</p>

## Intel’s ambitious Meteor Lake iGPU

date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News

Intel and AMD both tried to ship iGPUs fast enough to compete with low end discrete cards over the past 10 years with mixed results. Recently though, powerful iGPUs have been thrown back into the spotlight. Handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck and ASUS’s ROG Ally demonstrated that consumers are willing to accept compromises to play games on the go. AMD has dominated that market so far. Valve’s Steam Deck uses AMD’s Van Gogh APU, and the ROG Ally uses the newer Phoenix APU. Unlike Van Gogh, Phoenix is a general purpose mobile chip with both a powerful CPU and GPU. Phoenix doesn’t stop at targeting the handheld segment, and threatens Intel’s laptop market share too. In response, Meteor Lake brings a powerful iGPU to the party. It has the equivalent of 128 EUs and clocks up to 2.25 GHz, making it modestly wider and much faster than Raptor Lake’s 96 EU, 1.5 GHz iGPU. Raptor Lake’s Xe-LP graphics architecture gets replaced by Xe-LPG, a close relative of the Xe-HPG architecture used in Intel’s A770 discrete GPU. At the system level, Meteor Lake moves to a GPU integration scheme that better suits a chiplet configuration where the iGPU gets significant transistor and area budget. I’ll be testing Meteor Lake’s iGPU with the Core Ultra 7 155H, as implemented in the ASUS Zenbook 14. I purchased the device myself in late February. ↫ Chips and Cheese I&#8217;m absolutely here for the resurgence in capable integrated GPUs, both for PC gaming on the go and for better graphics performance even in thinner, smaller laptops. I would love to have just a bit more graphics power on my thin and small laptop so I can do some basic gaming with it.

## Google launches new Find My Device network on Android

date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News

Today, the all-new Find My Device is rolling out to Android devices around the world, starting in the U.S. and Canada. With a new, crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices, Find My Device can help you find your misplaced Android devices and everyday items quickly and securely. Here are five ways you can try it out. ↫ Erik Kay on the Google blog This old Android feature has basically been updated to be the same thing as Apple&#8217;s Find My, but with more than just one vendor making the tracking tags. Of course, this means it also comes with the same problems, from its use by stalkers to controlling partners, and everything in between. This is a very problematic technology, one which I think is almost impossible to make safe. Still, I have a Samsung tracker that I don&#8217;t use anymore &#8211; because I bought a Pixel 8 Pro, and don&#8217;t want to install any Samsung applications &#8211; and I do plan on getting a new tracker that&#8217;s compatible with this new Find My Device network. With two small kids, it&#8217;s easy to lose track of something like my car keys, and instead of stressing about where they are when we need to leave on time, I can just ping them using our Google Home devices instead. Sometimes, these silly smart technologies really do take just that little bit of stress out of your life &#8211; you just have to be really picky and honest with yourself about what you really need.

Something disturbing about America in 2024. Over a <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">million</a> Americans died of Covid, but they aren’t on our minds. A million more have long Covid, perhaps. This suggests a million Americans could be killed by our government in the name of a conspiracy, and we’d shrug it off like good Germans. “We didn’t know,” a likely defense.

## Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry

date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News

There are various ways you can change the default browser and similar defaults on Windows, but oneof the ways many third-party tools do this is by editing the relevant registry strings. It turns out that Microsoft is not particularly happy with this, as they&#8217;ve recently introduced a new driver specifically designed to prevent this from happening, by blocking tools like regedit or PowerShell from editing a number of registry keys for setting default applications. The driver was discovered by Christoph Kolbicz. Microsoft implemented a driver based protection to block changes to http/https and .pdf associations by 3rd party utilities. The rollout was staggered and activated “randomly”, but in the meantime I got many reports – also from business or education environments (but not Server OS). Microsoft also updated the driver during my tests (from 2.0 to 2.1) and extended the deny list of executables. This means, they can change the behavior almost on the fly and add new tricks or block additional extensions/protocols! ↫ Christoph Kolbicz Digging further into what, exactly, this driver can do, Microsoft also made it so that even if you disable the driver, an additional scheduled task will run to re-enable the driver and revert the registry changes. It also seems this is somehow related to the changes Microsoft has to make to comply with the EU&#8217;s DMA, but the driver is also installed on systems outside of the EU, so it&#8217;s all a bit unclear at the moment.

## Different kinds of networks

date: 2024-04-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Somewhat-related notes about different kinds of networks, ActivityPub and RSS, various twitter-like systems, as the social web spreads out and tries out new ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/07/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">With ActivityPub you know who's following you and in RSS you don't. This may sound like a negative until you think about it from the user's standpoint: no spam, spyware, etc. Which is probably why Google didn't like RSS btw. </li>
<li>It has been <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dusoft@fosstodon.org/112230502776773193">pointed out</a> that some level of spying happens based on IP address, and I can testify to that, I get podcasts with ads for a local supermarket, kind of spooky but I guess ok. I can't recall ever receiving spam as a result of subscribing to a feed, and I never get messages from them when I unsub begging me to come back. So it isn't a huge problem in a real way at least for me, yet.</li>
<li>I block spammers. In twitter-like systems, like Mastodon, spam means you attached a post to my post that is in no way responsive to it. You're just trying to coast on the flow generated by other posts. I don't abide that. Have a nice day.</li>
</ul>

## Episode 129 - ALGOL, Part I

date: 2024-04-07, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">ALGOL is one of those topics that's haunted the show for a while. It comes up any time we talk about programming languages, and with good reason. Many of the features and ideas found in modern languages have their roots in ALGOL. Despite that influence, ALGOL itself remains somewhat obscure. It never reached the highs of a C or LISP.</p> <p>In this series we are going to look at ALGOL from 1958 all up to 1968, keeping a careful eye on how the language evolved, how it's problems were addressed, and how new problems were introduced.</p> <p>Selected Sources:</p> <p><a href= "https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/ALGOL/paper/Backus-Syntax_and_Semantics_of_Proposed_IAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/ALGOL/paper/Backus-Syntax_and_Semantics_of_Proposed_IAL.pdf</a> - Backus, 1958 IAL report</p> <p><a href="https://algol60.org/reports/algol60_rr.pdf" rel= "noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://algol60.org/reports/algol60_rr.pdf</a> - ALGOL 1960 Report</p> <p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/1060960.1060966" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/1060960.1060966</a> - Cleaning Up Algol</p> <p> </p>

## Microsoft blocks even more customization apps in Windows 11 version 24H2

date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News

Users recently noticed that third-party apps for customizing the user interface no longer work in the upcoming Windows 11 version 24H2. Not only does Microsoft not allow you to run those apps, but it even blocks you from upgrading to newer builds. StartAllBack, a popular tool for tweaking the taskbar and Start menu in Windows 11, was among the first to fail on 24H2. Sadly, it is not the only one. ExplorerPatcher also no longer works in Windows 11 24H2. ExplorerPatcher from Valinet is quite a popular app that lets you bring back the old Windows 10 taskbar in Windows 11, apply additional modifications to make Windows 11 slightly better, and restore some of its missing features. Windows 11 version 24H2 is now flagging ExplorerPatcher as incompatible due to &#8220;security or performance issues&#8221; with the following message. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I guess the taskbar and Start menu are incredibly important real estate for Microsoft, since it&#8217;s the absolute prime spot for showing ads. If users replace their taskbar and Start menu with something from a third party, that prime real estate is gone. Major conspiracy vibes, yes, and I know this isn&#8217;t the reason, but why else would they be blocking these applications? I can&#8217;t think of anything that makes more sense.

## Outlook is Microsoft’s new data collection service

date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News

With Microsoft’s rollout of the new Outlook for Windows, it appears the company has transformed its email app into a surveillance tool for targeted advertising. Everyone talks about the privacy-washing campaigns of Google and Apple as they mine your online data to generate advertising revenue. But now it looks like Outlook is no longer simply an email service; it’s a data collection mechanism for Microsoft’s 801 external partners and an ad delivery system for Microsoft itself. ↫ Edward Komenda on the Proton blog Now, note that this is an article written by Proton, posted on the company blog, so of course they&#8217;re not going to be too kind towards their competitors. That being said, the article&#8217;s not wrong: the new Outlook web application, now the default in Windows, not only shared your data with around 800 partners, it also displays ads inside of the application. On macOS, it will even show yo fake emails that are, in fact, ads. Furthermore, once you add your accounts to this new Outlook web application, you&#8217;ll also be uploading your username and password to Microsoft, giving them access to your email accounts for advertising and data collection purposes, a shady practice a ton of email clients on mobile devices tend to do as well. Suffice it to say you really shouldn&#8217;t be using this new Outlook, and you should make sure friends and family don&#8217;t either. This is yet another nail in the coffin of Windows, now an advertising and data collection platform first, and operating system second.

## WinBtrfs: an open-source btrfs driver for Windows

date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News

WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs. A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the Linux kernel, and should work on any version from Windows XP onwards. It is also included as part of the free operating system ReactOS. ↫ WinBtrfs GitHub page If you&#8217;re running a distribution that defaults to Btrfs, or you actively choose to use it on other distributions, and you also happen to dual-boot Windows because your boss makes you use some garbage corpo software, this driver will make your setup a bit easier to manage.

## Generative AI as Shakespearean tragedy

date: 2024-04-07, from: Gary Marcus blog

You may have read yesterday&#8217;s New York Times report by Cade Metz and others on how many of the biggest AI companies have been cutting ethical corners in a race to gather as much data as possible (&#8220;OpenAI, Google and Meta ignored corporate policies, altered their own rules and discussed skirting copyright law as they sought online information to train their newest artificial intelligence systems&#8221;).

## The Race to Make Humans Obsolete

date: 2024-04-07, from: Pointers gone wild blog

I got up today, had my morning coffee, and was surprised to find that AI music is pretty much solved. Okay, there are still some audible artifacts, and you can argue that the song I linked to is generic if it makes you feel better. Still, as someone who&#8217;s dabbled with music and composition and [&#8230;]

## How my workday flows

date: 2024-04-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/07/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">On Bluesky, Andrew Hickey <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social/post/3kpjm37omkj2b">explains</a> how hard it is for him to focus while construction is going on at his house. I recognize the problem. I had major work done on the roof of my house last summer, and lost focus for a good two months, even though I had rented office space and at times an AirBnb to get away from the chaos. It wasn't until the work was over that I was able to start to get back into my flow. </p>
<p>In my work, I start pretty much at the same time every day, and I get a good five or six hours before it's time to do the next thing.  The first hour is warming up. Then I go to the notes I left the night before about where I'm going next. By hour two, I'm not quite at my highest rate but getting there, by hours 3-5 I get monster stuff done, if I'm in a good groove. Hour six is iffy. All the while I'm taking short breaks to check email, tweets, whatever. All of it asynchronous. Waiting for my attention to be available, for a short period.</p>
<p>After 5-6 hours of this, I'm wiped out.</p>
<p>I can handle small interruptions, like a package delivery.</p>
<p>But if it involves the front of my brain for any real amount of time, if I have to shift my attention elsewhere, boom, it all drops out of my head. It doesn't take much of a shift in attention to lose the whole thing, and basically have to start over the next day.</p>
<p>Try to imagine a professional tennis player. Do they talk about anything other than tennis during the game. Not with any focus. I'm sure of it. Their attention is fully on the sport. Same deal with intellectual achievement. If you're doing something that few other people do well, you're not only doing the complex things, and require multiple steps and a lot of detail, and memory, but you're sometimes inventing things that no one has done before. All the levels interact and affect each other. And you're doing a shitload of learning the whole time. Until you're burned out for the day that is. Or your deck gets shuffled. ;-)</p>
<p>PS: People sending you emails saying how great your last thing was, they don't interfere at all. ;-)</p>
<p>PPS: I wrote this post during one of my breaks. I won't edit it until the evening, when I do lite work that doesn't require much focus for any duration.</p>

## 2024-04-06 Travelling

date: 2024-04-07, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-06-travelling">2024-04-06 Travelling</h1>

<p>The last ten years, travels – even holiday travels! – have made me more and more nervous. I used to be so cool about travel. We lived abroad and travelled so much. And now I’d prefer to just stay in Switzerland all the time. But my wife still loves to travel and once I’m there, wherever it is, I feel OK again.</p>

<p>I can’t say what it is. A vague anxiety about everything. From the smallest thing like it’s spring and I’m going to miss the next two weeks of flowers, and the bees are all emerging from their reed tubes and I hope our friend is OK with watering the gazillion plants we have and I hope we didn’t forget anything and I hope security checks are going to be OK and foreign dictatorship and secret services are going to stay out of our lives and out of our phones and I hope we have enough money for tips and how much does one tip again?</p>

<p>Back when I was about thirty I argued that equipped with a credit card nothing else mattered. I’d just buy whatever I was missing. These days we start our “packing mound” days beforehand.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/2024-04-05-travel-1.mov">Look how happy I am about the bees</a>!</p>
