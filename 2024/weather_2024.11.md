Mesoscale Discussion 0258
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0945 AM CDT Fri Mar 15 2024

Areas affected...portions of central/southern LA...southern MS/AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 151445Z - 151645Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Severe potential is increasing across parts of Louisiana
into southern Mississippi late this morning. Large hail and damaging
gusts, along with a tornado or two will be possible across the MCD
area through the afternoon. A watch will likely be needed within the
next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...Occasionally strong storms have been ongoing this
morning across central Alabama across WW 51. This activity will
persist and local watch extensions may be needed across the
Birmingham forecast area in the short term to address locally
damaging gust and hail concerns. 

To the south/southwest across LA into southern MS, stronger heating
is noted with temperatures approaching the mid 70s amid 70-73 F
dewpoints. Steep midlevel lapse rates atop this moist boundary-layer
are already supporting moderate to strong destabilization. Visible
satellite imagery depicts agitated cumulus along/ahead of the
southeast-sagging outflow. Furthermore, water vapor imagery
indicates a compact shortwave trough over east TX. This is expected
to overspread LA/MS this afternoon, providing large-scale ascent
across the very moist and unstable boundary-layer. Morning CAMs
depict increasing storm coverage by midday and this seems reasonable
given short term trends in observational data this morning. Vertical
shear will be somewhat marginal initially, but increasing through
the day. Supercell storms capable of large hail and damaging gusts
will be the main concern. However, enlarged and favorably curved
low-level hodographs are noted in forecast soundings, and a couple
tornadoes will be possible. A new watch will likely be needed for
portions of LA into parts of southern MS/AL within the next 1-2
hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0257
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0909 AM CDT Fri Mar 15 2024

Areas affected...central Texas/Edwards Plateau vicinity

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 52...

Valid 151409Z - 151615Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 52
continues.

SUMMARY...A risk for large hail will continue into early afternoon
across central Texas and the Edwards Plateau vicinity. Additional
storm development is expected by midday.

DISCUSSION...A couple of supercells over southeastern portions of
the San Angelo forecast area have likely produced large hail this
morning, with MRMS MESH signatures as high as 1.75 inches. This
activity is likely elevated, spreading north of a southward sagging
cold front across the region. Nevertheless, steep lapse rates noted
in 12z RAOBS, combined with MUCAPE around 1000-2000 J/kg and strong
vertical shear will support a continued hail risk as these cells
track east/northeast. Some gradual weakening is expected with any
cells that develop further northeast into the deeper cool air across
Fort Worth forecast area. 

Additional storms are expected to develop with south and east extent
across WW 52 by midday. Heating has already allowed temperatures to
warm into the low/mid 70s ahead of the sagging cold front. Surface
dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s F will aid in strong
destabilization by early afternoon. Very large hail (2-3 inches in
diameter) will be possible, along with isolated strong gusts and
perhaps a tornado. With a 17z watch expiration time, it is possible
a small local extension in space/time may be needed. Additional
watch issuance is also possible later this afternoon toward the I-35
corridor across eastern portions of WFO Austin/San Antonio into
parts of WFO Houston. This area will be addressed in a separate MCD.

## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-03-15, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy1.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/day1fireotlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1011 AM CDT Fri Mar 15 2024

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

An Elevated risk area has been introduced for portions of the
Dakotas. Although relatively moist conditions are noted in morning
surface observations along the SD/ND border, westerly winds are
forecast to increase through the afternoon with ensemble consensus
showing high probability for sustained winds between 15-20 mph
(gusting to around 25-30 mph). The combination of diurnal heating
and westerly downslope flow off the northern High Plains should
yield RH reductions into the 20-30% range across northern SD into
far southern ND. Spread among guidance regarding afternoon RH
minimums persists, but there appears to be sufficient agreement in
near-20% RH along the SD/ND border (where fine fuels are fairly dry)
to warrant an Elevated fire weather risk area. Elevated conditions
may extend further north and east of the risk area, but cloud cover
overspreading ND out of southern Canada introduces uncertainty in
the RH minimum and max wind forecast.

..Moore.. 03/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1223 AM CDT Fri Mar 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
A cutoff low will remain within the lower Colorado River Valley
today. Within the northern Plains and parts of the upper Midwest, an
upper-level trough will dig southward out of Canada. A surface low
will deepen in southern Canada, increasing the surface pressure
gradient in the northern Plains. Breezy conditions are likely across
the Dakotas. RH may fall to near critical levels, particularly in
pars of northern South Dakota. However, there is some uncertainty
given the increase in mid/high-level clouds. Furthermore, the
strongest surface winds appear probable to be displaced farther
north where RH reductions are even less certain. Locally elevated
conditions may occur near the North/South Dakota border.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Fri Mar 15 2024

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH LATE
EVENING ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTH CENTRAL TX...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TODAY FROM
SOUTHEAST MS INTO CENTRAL AL...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms with very large hail and isolated
damaging winds are expected through this evening from the Edwards
Plateau into south central Texas.  Damaging winds will be possible
today from southeast Mississippi into central Alabama.

...Synopsis...
As part of an evolving Rex block, a midlevel closed low will remain
quasi-stationary over the lower CO River Valley through tonight. 
Farther east, subtle embedded speed maxima will eject northeastward
from northern Mexico to TX, while within the northern stream a
shortwave trough digs southeastward toward the upper Great Lakes
overnight.  Near and ahead of a surface cold front, an expansive
band of convection has persisted through the early morning hours
from the AR/LA border into northern AL.

...Edwards Plateau/south central TX through tonight...
Isolated supercells are ongoing over the Edwards Plateau in
association with a subtle speed max moving northeastward from
Mexico.  Steep midlevel lapse rates, boundary-layer dewpoints of
65-72 F south of a cold front, and sufficiently long hodographs will
favor a continuation of the isolated supercell/very large hail
threat this morning.  Additional supercell development is expected
later today through the afternoon into south central TX, with
isolated storm development possible into parts of southeast TX.  The
more intense storms will be capable of producing swaths of very
large hail (2-3 inches in diameter), along with isolated damaging
winds of 60-70 mph.  A storm cluster or two could also persist
through tonight near or a little east of the Rio Grande, with a
continued hail/wind threat into south TX.

...MS/AL today...
The MS/AL convection will persist through the day as the moist
boundary layer warms ahead of the storms.  Low-level flow will tend
to veer to westerly and slowly weaken through the day, though 50 kt
midlevel flow will be maintained into the Southeast.  This will
support the potential for occasional/embedded line segments capable
of producing damaging winds, mainly across southeast MS into central
AL where the larger buoyancy is expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 0249

0858 PM CDT Thu Mar 14 2024

Areas affected...Far southeastern Illinois into southern Indiana

Concerning...Tornado Watch 43...44...47...

Valid 150158Z - 150300Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 43, 44, 47 continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging winds will be the primary threat with an
organized line of storms moving into southern Indiana. A
line-embedded supercell will be capable of producing a tornado.

DISCUSSION...An organized line of convection with an embedded
supercell continues east into southern Indiana. This embedded
supercell has shown relatively strong low-level rotation and will be
the primary focus for tornado potential during the next hour.
Damaging winds will also be possible, particularly with the more
north-south oriented line. The KVWX VAD showed around 70 kts at
1-1.5 km AGL as the line passed. The eastward extent of the severe
threat is somewhat uncertain given the increasing CINH and
decreasing buoyancy. However, some destabilization is expected ahead
of this line and, with it being organized, it is probable it
persists for a few more hours.

## SPC Mar 15, 2024 0100 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

date: 2024-03-15, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 PM CDT Thu Mar 14 2024

Valid 150100Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST
TEXAS TO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Large damaging hail, wind gusts, and a few tornadoes remain a threat
from far northeast Texas to the Ohio Valley.

...01z Update...

An elongated corridor of strong/severe convection continues this
evening from northeast TX/AR into the OH Valley. Negligible height
changes are expected along this corridor the rest of the period;
although, several weak transient short-wave troughs will affect this
region through 12z. One noteworthy short wave has encouraged a
significant MCS over southeast MO/southern IL. An MCV may be
evolving near STL which will track across southern IL into the OH
Valley later tonight.

Radar trends exhibit a narrow swath of scattered supercells
extending downstream ahead of the larger MCS across central IN into
central OH. This activity has longevity and will likely spread a bit
farther east than earlier indicated. Given these trends, will extend
severe probs across eastern OH into western PA to account for these
supercells maintaining intensity into an otherwise weaker
instability regime.

Much stronger instability resides across central TX into central AR
early this evening. Numerous supercells have evolved from the north
central TX, across southeast OK into central AR. Most of these
storms are producing large hail, some in excess of 2" in diameter.
00z sounding from LZK exhibits SBCAPE around 2500 J/kg with
substantial deep-layer shear and adequate 0-3km SRH. In addition to
large hail, tornadoes remain a risk with these organized supercells.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-03-14, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0324 PM CDT Thu Mar 14 2024

Valid 161200Z - 221200Z

A cut-off low will persist across the Southwest this weekend and
through the middle of next week. This will bring significant
rainfall to much of the southern High Plains this weekend.
Significant wetting of fuels in the region and a lack of any warm,
dry, and breezy conditions will limit fire weather concerns through
next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CDT Tue Mar 12 2024

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO...WESTERN
TEXAS INTO THE TEXAS PANHANDLE...PORTIONS OF WESTERN OKLAHOMA INTO
THE EASTERN OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE....

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced westerly mid-level flow will round the western US
longwave trough on Wednesday before overspreading the Rocky
Mountains and the central Plains. Lee cyclogenesis will occur across
the central high Plains, with a surface dryline extending from
central Kansas southward into western/central Texas. Elevated to
Critical fire weather conditions are expected behind the surface
dryline, where strong westerly flow is expected to overlap low
afternoon relative humidity.

Across southeastern New Mexico into western Texas and northward into
western Oklahoma, relative-humidity reductions to 10-20 percent will
overlap surface winds around 20-25 mph (locally as high as 30 mph).
Latest fuel guidance indicates fuels within this region remain
critically dry, which will support inclusion of a Critical risk.
Recent fire activity also supports the notion that fuels within this
area remain critically dry.
