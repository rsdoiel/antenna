Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook RESENT 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1201 PM CDT Mon Mar 11 2024

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN WYOMING INTO FAR SOUTHWEST
SOUTH DAKOTA AND THE NORTHWEST NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...THE
TX/OK PANHANDLES...MUCH OF CENTRAL/WEST-CENTRAL KANSAS...AND EASTERN
NEBRASKA...

Expanded the Critical area into eastern Nebraska based on morning
high resolution guidance showing sustained winds up to 25 mph and
relative humidity in the teens. In addition, expanded the Elevated
area slightly farther east into Iowa and southwest Minnesota.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CDT Mon Mar 11 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave will move into the Great Basin on Monday, with
westerly flow increasing across the Rockies and strengthening lee
troughing across the Plains. This will result in strong downslope
warming and drying across the central and south-central Plains. Two
regions of Critical fire weather conditions are expected, with more
widespread Elevated fire weather concerns across much of the central
High Plains into the southern High Plains.

...Eastern Wyoming into far southwest South Dakota and the northwest
Nebraska Panhandle...
Westerly downslope flow (sustained around 20-25 mph) across the high
terrain in eastern Wyoming and southwestern South Dakota will allow
to relative-humidity reductions around 15-20 percent (locally as low
as 10 percent). Rainfall deficits over the last month have led to
fine fuels sufficiently dry to support fire spread. As such, a
Critical delineation was maintained in this region.

...Far northeast New Mexico into the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles and
much of central/west-central Kansas...
Westerly downslope flow (sustained at 20-25 mph) across eastern New
Mexico into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles will result in
relative-humidity reductions to around 10-15 percent. Early spring
green up of fine fuels, which were subsequently cured by recent
freezing temperatures, has led to large fire activity in the last
month across these regions. A Critical delineation was maintained
across this region. 

Critical conditions will extend into portions of western and
west-central Kansas where afternoon relative-humidity reductions to
around 15-20 percent will overlap sustained winds around 15-20 mph).
Fuel guidance suggests that fine fuels in this region will are
sufficiently dry enough to support fire spread.
