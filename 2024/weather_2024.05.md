Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0653 AM CST Fri Feb 02 2024

Valid 021300Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
NORTHWEST TEXAS TO PARTS OF SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS AND THE NEARBY RIO
GRANDE VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe hail, damaging gusts and a tornado or two are possible over
parts of the southern Plains, from late afternoon into this evening.

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified, somewhat progressive mid/upper-level pattern is
forecast through the period, with ridging shifting slowly eastward
across central Canada and the Mississippi Valley.  Upstream, height
falls will spread across the Rockies and Great Plains States.  The
most convectively impactful feature will be a basal shortwave trough
-- with several associated vorticity maxima -- initially evident in
moisture-channel imagery over portions of southern CA, the lower
Colorado River Valley, and northwestern MX.  The trough should shift
eastward and strengthen, extending from the Four Corners area across
central/southern NM past ELP and over Chihuahua around 00Z.  By 12Z,
a closed 500-mb low should develop over northeastern NM, with the
trough south-southeastward across the Llano Estacado and Permian
Basin to Coahuila. 

At 11Z, surface analysis showed lee troughing over eastern parts of
CO and NM, with a few weak/attached lows, as well as pockets of 60s
F surface dewpoints reaching as far north as the SAT-AUS region.  A
diffuse Pacific cold front was apparent over east-central NM and far
west TX, and should sharpen through the day as it crosses west TX. 
A dryline was drawn from northwest TX southwestward over the Permian
Basin, then south-southeastward into higher terrain of northern
Coahuila.  This dryline should mix eastward through this afternoon
to the Edwards Plateau on the south side, and move little on the
north side.  The lee trough should strengthen throughout the period,
with cyclogenesis expected overnight in the area from the
northwestern TX Panhandle to southeastern CO.  The Pacific front to
its south and southeast should overtake the dryline and shift
eastward from west TX into central and south TX tonight.

...TX/OK...
Episodes of strong-severe thunderstorms are expected to cross the
outlook area starting this afternoon along/ahead of the dryline --
initially moving roughly northward over in the northwest TX/eastern
Panhandle/western OK region.  Isolated severe hail, damaging gusts
and potential for a brief tornado exists with this activity.  

A later but more-substantial severe threat is apparent across parts
of northwest, central and southwest TX, east of
late-afternoon/early-evening development areas along:
1.  The dryline, 
2.  The Pacific front, and 
3.  Eastern slopes of the Serranias del Burro of Coahuila leading
down to the Rio Grande.
Supercellular and bowing/quasi-linear modes are possible in and near
the "slight" area, offering sporadic severe hail, isolated severe
gusts and potential for a tornado or two.  Some hail may exceed 2
inches in diameter from supercell(s) in the first few hours of the
convective cycle over parts of south TX (southern Hill Country
southward).  In that area, the most-favorable combination of steep
deep-layer lapse rates, inflow-layer moisture, and long hodographs
is expected. 

Large-scale lift will strengthen through tonight across much of the
southern Plains -- under the influences of low-level warm advection
and midlevel DCVA.  Also, as a 125-160-kt 250-mb jet extends inland
across southern CA and northwestern MX -- behind the mid/upper
trough -- its left-exit region and associated lift aloft should
spread this evening and overnight across parts of central/south TX,
where the steepest midlevel lapse rates (exceeding 7 deg C/km) are
expected.  These influences will extend atop a moistening and
diurnally destabilizing boundary layer with surface dewpoints in the
50s F over northwest TX and OK, and 60s in the Edwards Plateau and
Hill Country southward to the Rio Grande.  Adequate deep-layer
instability/buoyancy for surface-based convection is expected on
either side of the dryline today, and along/ahead of the Pacific
front tonight.  Peak/preconvective MLCAPE should reach around
1000-1500 J/kg in a narrow, south-north corridor ahead of the
dryline, diminishing eastward toward east TX.  Low-level shear may
be stronger over northern parts of the outlook, but with greater
deep shear southward toward the more-intense mid/upper winds.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1117 AM CST Wed Jan 31 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Thursday.

...Synopsis...
Deep upper troughing is expected to extend along the length of the
West Coast early Thursday morning. A shortwave trough is forecast to
move through the base of this upper troughing over central/southern
CA and into AZ throughout the period. This evolution will help
induce a more negative tilt to the parent upper troughing by early
Friday morning. A large area of precipitation is anticipated within
the warm conveyor preceding this shortwave, beginning the period
over CA and ending the period across AZ, southern UT, and the Four
Corners vicinity. Predominately stable conditions are anticipated
within this leading area of precipitation. However, cooling
mid-level temperatures in its wake should result in limited buoyancy
and the potential for a few lightning flashes with the more cellular
convection as it gradually shifts eastward from CA into southern AZ.

Some limited buoyancy may also develop during the afternoon and
evening in the Four Corners vicinity, amid the persistent warm-air
advection ahead of the shortwave (and ahead of large area of
precipitation). As such, some of the storms may become deep enough
to produce isolated lightning flashes.

Farther east, upper ridging, initially extending from the Lower MS
Valley through the northern Plains, will gradually shift eastward,
ending the period extended from the Mid-South through the Upper
Midwest. As it does, a compact shortwave trough is forecast to move
across KS and OK. Some showers are possible across the southern
Plains in association with this wave, but stable conditions will
preclude deep convection. Upper troughing will also progress across
the Upper Great Lakes into the OH Valley and Northeast, but cool,
stable conditions will preclude thunderstorm development.

Valid 311630Z - 011200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible tonight along parts of the
California Coast.

...CA Coast...
A large upper trough is beginning to affect the Pacific coast today,
with a band of rain moving ashore.  This pre-frontal precipitation
is in a generally stable environment, and is not expected to support
organized thunderstorm activity.

Later tonight, continued cooling of mid-level temperatures will
result in steep lapse rates over the offshore waters, leading to a
risk of a few thunderstorms in the post-frontal cellular convection.
 This activity is expected to be quite sparse.  No severe storms are
expected.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0919 AM CST Wed Jan 31 2024

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track with no adjustments needed.
Forecast concerns regarding the southern/central High Plains remains
on track (see the previous discussion below for details). 

Across southern GA and Florida, dry air is slowly filtering into
region as a cold front pushes into central FL under mostly clear
skies. With no apparent inhibitions for maximal RH reductions this
afternoon, RH reductions into the mid to low 30s appear probable
from northern to central FL. Additionally, the probability of
sustained winds over 15 mph seems reasonably high, and should
support a few hours of elevated fire weather conditions. This
appears most likely to occur across central FL, but fuels remains
only marginally dry based on latest fuel reports. Highlights are
withheld due to the limited availability of receptive fuels, but a
few hours of elevated fire weather conditions is probable.

..Moore.. 01/31/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0123 AM CST Wed Jan 31 2024/

...Synopsis...
Amplified upper-level ridging will move into the Plains today. Along
the West Coast, a broad upper trough will move ashore during the
period. Farther east, a weak shortwave trough will lift out of the
Southwest and into the central Rockies. A strong shortwave trough
will exit the southeastern U.S. coastline.

...Parts of southern/central High Plains...
A deeper lee trough will develop in response to the weak shortwave
trough and otherwise generally increasing mid-level flow across the
southern Rockies. Dry and windy conditions are possible from the
Texas Panhandle into adjacent Colorado and Kansas. RH will more than
likely stay above 20% for most areas (partially due to cloud cover)
and winds will be marginal. Unreceptive fuels will further reduce
overall fire weather concerns.

...Southern Georgia/North Florida...
The shortwave trough moving through the area will deepen a surface
low off the coast of the Carolinas. This should help to increase
northwesterly winds across the region. RH near 30% appears possible
with winds of 10-15 mph (locally greater). Without drier fuels,
however, fire weather risk will likely remain minimal to localized.

0138 PM CST Tue Jan 30 2024

Valid 302000Z - 311200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
No thunderstorm areas are apparent through tonight.

...20Z Update...
An isolated flash or two still remains possible across southeast AZ
this evening as well as over the Carolina Piedmont tonight. However,
overall coverage in both of these areas is still expected to remain
less than 10%.

..Mosier.. 01/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1021 AM CST Tue Jan 30 2024/

...Synopsis/Discussion...
Downstream of a broad/weak southern-latitude mid/upper-level trough
currently over the Baja Peninsula, morning satellite imagery shows
an embedded disturbance tracking slowly northward across northwest
Mexico. This embedded disturbance should generally continue
northward within a belt of modest south-southwesterly flow
downstream of the parent trough, with related lift overspreading
portions of southeastern AZ by this afternoon. Despite increasing
cloud coverage associated with this feature, ample diurnal
heating/steepening low-level lapse rates amid weak low-level
moisture advection may support very weak surface-based instability
(characterized by an inverted-V profile) across far southeastern AZ
by this afternoon. However, given modest large-scale ascent and the
limited buoyancy, any embedded lightning potential appears too low
for a General Thunderstorm area. 

Farther east, a robust midlevel trough and attendant jet streak will
continue southeastward across the OH and TN Valleys today. While
strong deep-layer lift along a related cold front will favor a swath
of east/southeastward-moving precipitation into the Carolinas, any
pre-frontal elevated buoyancy appears too limited for a substantial
thunderstorm risk. The one exception will be offshore of NC during
the overnight/early morning hours, where heat/moisture fluxes atop
the Gulf Steam will contribute to sufficient instability for
thunderstorms.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1234 PM CST Tue Jan 30 2024

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Latest guidance continues to show
some potential for areas of elevated fire weather conditions across
the TX Panhandle into southeast CO/southwest KS, but recent fuel
guidance continues to suggests fuels are not overly receptive.
Additionally, localized elevated fire weather conditions may
materialize across central to northern Florida as a dry offshore
flow regime continues. RH reductions into the low 30s may coincide
with 10-15 mph winds, but latest fuel guidance indicates fuels are
near to below the 50th percentile. No highlights are introduced for
now, but fuel and RH/wind trends will be monitored for both regions.

..Moore.. 01/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CST Tue Jan 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broadly cyclonic flow aloft will move into the West Coast and parts
of the Great Basin on Wednesday. A lead weak shortwave trough moving
out of the Four Corners will lift northeast into the central High
Plains. A modestly deep lee trough will develop in response in
eastern Colorado/western Kansas. Some enhancement of southerly winds
is possible from the Texas Panhandle into western Kansas. While RH
could fall near 20%, current fuel moisture is too high for fire
weather concerns.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CST Mon Jan 29 2024

Valid 311200Z - 061200Z

Fire weather potential through the work week remains limited, though
regional concerns may emerge across southwest Texas by next weekend.
Latest long-range ensemble guidance continues to show reasonably
good agreement in the maintenance of an upper ridge over the
Intermountain West and Plains through the middle of the work week.
This pattern will favor dry conditions across the central U.S. while
southwesterly flow along the West Coast and a shortwave trough
across the OH River Valley/Southeast introduce precipitation chances
elsewhere. A persistent west/northwest flow regime is expected to
promote unseasonably warm temperatures across the Plains that may
result in some fuel drying through the week, though winds are
forecast to remain sufficiently light to preclude fire concerns.

Heading into the upcoming weekend, long-range guidance depicts a
subtropical jet extension nosing into northern Mexico/southern TX.
This should support lee troughing/cyclogenesis across the southern
High Plains with breezy westerly winds across southern NM into
southwest TX. Deterministic solutions have come into better
agreement regarding this scenario, and the probability for at least
elevated (to possibly critical) fire weather conditions across
southwest TX has increased in latest ensemble guidance. Fuels across
this region are currently not receptive, but may trend drier prior
to this weekend. Forecast and fuel trends will be monitored in
subsequent outlooks for an increasing fire weather threat.
