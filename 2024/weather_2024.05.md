Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0629 AM CST Mon Jan 29 2024

Valid 291300Z - 301200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
The mid/upper-level pattern will remain unsuitable for deep moist
convection through the period over most of the CONUS.  A strong,
synoptic-scale trough -- now exiting the East Coast, has been
preceded by a surface cold front leaving a cool, stable boundary
layer behind it, east of the Rockies.  Meanwhile, a high-amplitude
ridge will shift slowly eastward across the Intermountain West,
Great Basin and northern Rockies.  

A northern-stream shortwave trough -- apparent in moisture-channel
imagery over MB -- is forecast to dig southeastward to the Upper
Great Lakes and mid/upper parts of the Mississippi Valley overnight.
This feature will be preceded by a strengthening low-level cold
front and large-scale lift aloft.  An associated band of precip --
with embedded, weak, mainly midlevel convection -- should cross
parts of MI/Lake Michigan/IL overnight, reaching northern IN by 12Z.
While some forecast soundings indicate very weak elevated MUCAPE
(less than 100 J/kg) in roughly the 600-500-mb layer, any lighting
potential appears too uncertain and isolated for an unconditional,
10% general-thunder area.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-01-29, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1258 AM CST Mon Jan 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will persist in the Rockies and across the
Plains on Tuesday. A weak cold front will move into the southern
High Plains early in the period. Similar to Monday, dry conditions
are possible in parts of the Southwest/southern High Plains. Again,
winds will be light and fuel receptiveness is still likely to be
poor. Fire weather concerns remain minimal across the CONUS.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1057 AM CST Sun Jan 28 2024

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected on Monday.

...Synopsis...

A dry, continental airmass will envelop much of the CONUS in the
wake of a cold frontal passage into the Gulf of Mexico and western
Atlantic. Stable conditions will prevail given a dearth of
boundary-layer moisture and thunderstorms are not expected.

## SPC Jan 28, 2024 1630 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

date: 2024-01-28, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1027 AM CST Sun Jan 28 2024

Valid 281630Z - 291200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast today.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
A midlevel low currently centered over the Ohio Valley will track
eastward into the western Atlantic ocean as it devolves into an open
wave through the period. A related cold front extending
south-southwestward along the Gulf Stream into central Florida will
continue southeastward across southern Florida into this evening.
Along/immediately ahead of the southeastward-moving front, diurnal
heating of a moist boundary layer (lower 70s dewpoints) should
support isolated thunderstorm development across central/southern
Florida despite poor midlevel lapse rates and dry air aloft.
Organized severe thunderstorm potential appears low owing to veered
surface winds/weak frontal convergence, weak instability, and modest
deep-layer shear.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0906 AM CST Sun Jan 28 2024

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (below) remains on track with no changes
needed. Morning observations and latest forecast guidance continue
to suggest low potential for fire weather concerns across the
country.

..Moore.. 01/28/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1115 PM CST Sat Jan 27 2024/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will build into the West and extend into the
High Plains region today. Surface high pressure will extend from the
Northwest into the southern Plains. With some downslope flow,
temperatures in the southern High Plains will warm. Given weak
winds, marginal RH, and poorly receptive fuels, fire weather
concerns are not expected within the region. Similarly, modest dry
offshore winds are anticipated in southern California. However, poor
fuels receptiveness will mitigate fire weather risk here as well.
