Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 PM CST Tue Jan 30 2024

Valid 302000Z - 311200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
No thunderstorm areas are apparent through tonight.

...20Z Update...
An isolated flash or two still remains possible across southeast AZ
this evening as well as over the Carolina Piedmont tonight. However,
overall coverage in both of these areas is still expected to remain
less than 10%.

..Mosier.. 01/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1021 AM CST Tue Jan 30 2024/

...Synopsis/Discussion...
Downstream of a broad/weak southern-latitude mid/upper-level trough
currently over the Baja Peninsula, morning satellite imagery shows
an embedded disturbance tracking slowly northward across northwest
Mexico. This embedded disturbance should generally continue
northward within a belt of modest south-southwesterly flow
downstream of the parent trough, with related lift overspreading
portions of southeastern AZ by this afternoon. Despite increasing
cloud coverage associated with this feature, ample diurnal
heating/steepening low-level lapse rates amid weak low-level
moisture advection may support very weak surface-based instability
(characterized by an inverted-V profile) across far southeastern AZ
by this afternoon. However, given modest large-scale ascent and the
limited buoyancy, any embedded lightning potential appears too low
for a General Thunderstorm area. 

Farther east, a robust midlevel trough and attendant jet streak will
continue southeastward across the OH and TN Valleys today. While
strong deep-layer lift along a related cold front will favor a swath
of east/southeastward-moving precipitation into the Carolinas, any
pre-frontal elevated buoyancy appears too limited for a substantial
thunderstorm risk. The one exception will be offshore of NC during
the overnight/early morning hours, where heat/moisture fluxes atop
the Gulf Steam will contribute to sufficient instability for
thunderstorms.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1234 PM CST Tue Jan 30 2024

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Latest guidance continues to show
some potential for areas of elevated fire weather conditions across
the TX Panhandle into southeast CO/southwest KS, but recent fuel
guidance continues to suggests fuels are not overly receptive.
Additionally, localized elevated fire weather conditions may
materialize across central to northern Florida as a dry offshore
flow regime continues. RH reductions into the low 30s may coincide
with 10-15 mph winds, but latest fuel guidance indicates fuels are
near to below the 50th percentile. No highlights are introduced for
now, but fuel and RH/wind trends will be monitored for both regions.

..Moore.. 01/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CST Tue Jan 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broadly cyclonic flow aloft will move into the West Coast and parts
of the Great Basin on Wednesday. A lead weak shortwave trough moving
out of the Four Corners will lift northeast into the central High
Plains. A modestly deep lee trough will develop in response in
eastern Colorado/western Kansas. Some enhancement of southerly winds
is possible from the Texas Panhandle into western Kansas. While RH
could fall near 20%, current fuel moisture is too high for fire
weather concerns.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1111 AM CST Tue Jan 30 2024

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Wednesday.

...Synopsis...
Upper pattern early Wednesday is expected to feature ridging over
the Plains flanked by a pair of troughs, one extending from the
Mid-Atlantic to the central Gulf Coast and the other off the West
Coast. Surface cyclogenesis will likely be underway off the Carolina
coast ahead of the eastern shortwave trough, with some warm-air
advection thunderstorms likely ongoing within the attendant warm
conveyor offshore. Isolated thunderstorms are also possible along
the cold front as it moves offshore later during the late
morning/early afternoon. In both instance, storms are expected to
stay far enough offshore to keep onshore thunderstorm probabilities
less than 10%. 

Frontal zone associated with the western upper trough is forecast to
begin the period just off the West Coast, with gradual eastward
progress anticipated throughout the day. A large area of showers is
anticipated within the warm conveyor ahead of this front, but
mid-level temperatures are expected to be too warm for much
buoyancy. Mid-level temperatures will cool throughout the day, from
north to south, contributing to the development of limited buoyancy
in the wake of the front. Given the persistent forcing for ascent,
isolated convection is possible behind the front, with some of these
showers becoming deep enough to produce isolated lightning flashes.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track with no changes needed.
Morning surface observations and latest ensemble guidance continue
to suggest low fire weather potential. See the previous discussion
below for details.

..Moore.. 01/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CST Tue Jan 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue to build into the Plains today. At
the surface, weak high pressure will settle into the southern Plains
behind a diffuse boundary. While a few dry pockets may develop in
parts of the Southwest and southern High Plains, light winds and
continued poor fuel receptiveness will keep fire weather concerns to
a minimum.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CST Mon Jan 29 2024

Valid 311200Z - 061200Z

Fire weather potential through the work week remains limited, though
regional concerns may emerge across southwest Texas by next weekend.
Latest long-range ensemble guidance continues to show reasonably
good agreement in the maintenance of an upper ridge over the
Intermountain West and Plains through the middle of the work week.
This pattern will favor dry conditions across the central U.S. while
southwesterly flow along the West Coast and a shortwave trough
across the OH River Valley/Southeast introduce precipitation chances
elsewhere. A persistent west/northwest flow regime is expected to
promote unseasonably warm temperatures across the Plains that may
result in some fuel drying through the week, though winds are
forecast to remain sufficiently light to preclude fire concerns.

Heading into the upcoming weekend, long-range guidance depicts a
subtropical jet extension nosing into northern Mexico/southern TX.
This should support lee troughing/cyclogenesis across the southern
High Plains with breezy westerly winds across southern NM into
southwest TX. Deterministic solutions have come into better
agreement regarding this scenario, and the probability for at least
elevated (to possibly critical) fire weather conditions across
southwest TX has increased in latest ensemble guidance. Fuels across
this region are currently not receptive, but may trend drier prior
to this weekend. Forecast and fuel trends will be monitored in
subsequent outlooks for an increasing fire weather threat.

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0629 AM CST Mon Jan 29 2024

Valid 291300Z - 301200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
The mid/upper-level pattern will remain unsuitable for deep moist
convection through the period over most of the CONUS.  A strong,
synoptic-scale trough -- now exiting the East Coast, has been
preceded by a surface cold front leaving a cool, stable boundary
layer behind it, east of the Rockies.  Meanwhile, a high-amplitude
ridge will shift slowly eastward across the Intermountain West,
Great Basin and northern Rockies.  

A northern-stream shortwave trough -- apparent in moisture-channel
imagery over MB -- is forecast to dig southeastward to the Upper
Great Lakes and mid/upper parts of the Mississippi Valley overnight.
This feature will be preceded by a strengthening low-level cold
front and large-scale lift aloft.  An associated band of precip --
with embedded, weak, mainly midlevel convection -- should cross
parts of MI/Lake Michigan/IL overnight, reaching northern IN by 12Z.
While some forecast soundings indicate very weak elevated MUCAPE
(less than 100 J/kg) in roughly the 600-500-mb layer, any lighting
potential appears too uncertain and isolated for an unconditional,
10% general-thunder area.
