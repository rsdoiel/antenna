<span>Any comedic writer will tell you there’s nothing more satisfying
than a well-placed joke. That’s probably because writing comedy isn’t
easy. Just like any other screenplay, a comedic screenplay has to have a
well-developed story and three-dimensional characters while making
audiences laugh. You have to be funny while trying not to be funny while
remaining true to the situation at hand and the character’s personality.
This is no easy feat. </span>

how to structure and expose that internal drive, the importance of an
