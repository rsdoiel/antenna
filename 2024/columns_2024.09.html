<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Chris Heilmann’s blog</p>
<p>Apple wants to disallow Web Apps on iOS to be added to the home
screen, run full screen and use the APIs necessary to create a great
app. And to make things worse, only in Europe. We need to stop this from
happening. The European Union is enforcing its Digital Markets Act and

<h2 id="a-cyber-insurance-backstop">A Cyber Insurance Backstop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, updated: 2024-02-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
In the first week of January, the pharmaceutical giant Merck quietly
<a href="https://therecord.media/merck-insurance-settlement-notpetya">settled
its years-long lawsuit</a> over whether or not its property and casualty
insurers would cover a $700 million claim filed after the devastating
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">NotPetya
cyberattack</a> in 2017. The malware ultimately infected more than
40,000 of Merck’s computers, which significantly disrupted the company’s
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1AD1AO/">drug and
vaccine production</a>. After Merck filed its $700 million claim, the
pharmaceutical giant’s insurers argued that they were not required to
cover the malware’s damage because the cyberattack was widely attributed
to the Russian government and therefore was excluded from standard
property and casualty insurance coverage as a “hostile or warlike act.”…

Hours: Should the Michigan primary result be a wakeup call to
Biden?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Robert Reich’s blog</p>
<p>Friends, The question was never whether Joe Biden would win the
Michigan primary. It was how successful would be a homegrown campaign to
persuade Michiganders to vote “uncommitted.” Well, we now have the
results, and they should serve as a wakeup call to Biden. With most
votes counted on Wednesday morning, 13 percent of Michigan’s Democratic
primary voters had chosen “uncommitted” — a share that represented more
than 100,000 people in Michigan who made the effort to lodge their
disapproval of the president.</p>

Announces Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithms for iMessage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-26, updated: 2024-02-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Apple announced
<a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">PQ3</a>, its
post-quantum encryption standard based on the
<a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/">Kyber</a> secure
key-encapsulation protocol, one of the post-quantum algorithms
<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-algorithms-2022">selected</a>
by NIST in 2022.
</p>
<p>
There’s a lot of detail in the Apple
<a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">blog post</a>,
and more in Douglas Stabila’s
<a href="https://security.apple.com/assets/files/Security_analysis_of_the_iMessage_PQ3_protocol_Stebila.pdf">security
analysis</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am of two minds about this. On the one hand, it’s probably premature
to switch to any particular post-quantum algorithms. The mathematics of
cryptanalysis for these lattice and other systems is still rapidly
evolving, and we’re likely to break more of them—and learn a lot in the
process—over the coming few years. But if you’re going to make the
switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple’s ability to do this so
efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably
more important than its particular cryptographic design. And it is
probably about the right time to worry about, and defend against,
attackers who are storing encrypted messages in hopes of breaking them
later on future quantum computers…
