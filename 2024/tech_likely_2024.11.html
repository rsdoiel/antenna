<p>Do we have enough fuel to get to our destination? This is probably
one of the first questions that comes to mind whenever your family gets
ready to embark on a road trip. If the trip is long, you will need to
visit gas stations along your route to refuel during your travel. NASA
is grappling with similar issues as it gets ready to embark on a
sustainable mission back to the Moon and plans future missions to
Mars.</p>

institutions and bodies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Following its investigation, the EDPS has found that the European
Commission (Commission) has infringed several key data protection rules
when using Microsoft 365. In its decision, the EDPS imposes corrective
measures on the Commission. ↫ European Data Protection Supervisor You
often hear people state that EU rules and regulations are designed
exclusively to harm non-EU companies. The massive amounts of fines and
corrective actions handed out to EU companies in all kinds of sectors
already disprove this notion, and here’s a case where even the European
Commission itself gets a slap on the wrist for violating its own rules
and regulations – rules and regulations, we’re often told by especially
American corporatists, are designed specifically to target poor American
businesses. Not that corporatists have any use for reality and facts,
but still.</p>

<h2 id="ai-and-the-nyt">AI and the NYT</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Zach Seward, a friend from my days at
<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/about/">Harvard</a> and NYU, got a
kickass
<a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/zach-seward-is-the-newsrooms-editorial-director-of-a-i-initiatives/">job</a>,
starting up the AI effort at the NYT. He’s just the right guy for it.
Young, curious, creative, and very ambitious. And he has a strong
startup journalism background. I couldn’t think of anyone I’d want more
to be in this position.
</p>
<p>
Now that he’s published
<a href="https://www.zachseward.com/ai-news-thats-fit-to-print-sxsw-2024/?ref=zach-seward-newsletter">notes</a>
for a talk he gave at SXSW, it’s time to share some of the ideas I have
for the NYT re AI.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Current events. This is something ChatGPT doesn’t do. Not sure why. I’d
like to be able to connect to
<a href="https://ai.nytimes.com/">ai.nytimes.com</a> and ask it to give
me a rundown on the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/09.html#a200615">lawyer</a> who’s
testifying in Congress today about how our president is “elderly.” I
don’t want pointers to stories, though they should be included in the
response, I want a custom report, like the ones ChatGPT provides, that
answers the questions I have about this dude. Maybe the AI will factor
out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95kNwZw8YY">BS</a> the
NYT adds to their stories and just give me the facts without all the
spin.
</li>
<li>
More useful NYT archives. When I was a kid I spent so much time at the
<a href="https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/locations/central-library">big
library</a> in Jamaica (Queens) going back through microfilm of the NYT
from before I was born. So far all we’ve done is replicate the microfilm
user experience (which is great and very useful) but the thing that
ChatGPT does so well is prepare custom reports. All that source
material, used to answer very specific questions.
</li>
<li>
Sell a service to your readers where you manage the archive of their
blogs, and in doing so you create a much broader archive for historians,
journalists and others to study in the future. At some point the NYT and
other journalism outlets will harness the energy, knowledge and
intelligence of the readers, why not start now?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I criticize the NYT a lot, I know. But that
<a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">means</a> I care.
When I stop criticizing you’ll know that I’ve given up.
</p>
<p>
Alan Kay <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/707961">said</a> of the
Mac, it’s the first personal computer worth criticizing. That’s the
spirit.

<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html">Emacs
Calendar</a> is great. Better than the <code>cal</code> command-line
utility, in any case. But eventually the world got mobile phones and I
wanted an online calendar.
</p>
<p>
The example from the Emacs Diary documentation:
</p>
<pre><code>12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
10/22       Ruth's birthday.
* 21, *:    Payday
Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
         Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
mar 16      Dad's birthday
April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
* 15        time cards due.
</code></pre>
<p>
Back then, Google didn’t want to be evil and I used Google Calendar.
When Google changed its mind, so did I. I switched to
<a href="2020-06-10_Radicale_for_Calendar_and_Contacts">Radicale</a>.
</p>
<p>
And yet, I sort of missed those diary file entries.
</p>
<p>
Today,
<a class="account" href="https://social.tadzik.net/users/tadzik" title="@tadzik@social.tadzik.net"><span
class="citation" data-cites="tadzik">@tadzik</span></a> posted a link to
<a href="https://codeberg.org/tadzik/caleb">caleb</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>caleb</code> will do its best to interpret a calendar event
description, create a valid iCalendar event for it and optionally upload
it to a CalDAV server.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nice!
</p>
<p>
Example usage, from the README:
</p>
<pre><code>$ caleb friday 5pm beer
</code></pre>
<p>
My main problem was that it took me a while to figure out what the
correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> URL
is. I looked into my iPhone accounts (my first mistake) and tried
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/Alex</code> – some of these URLs
failed silently, some of them created new collections with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> filename
as the collection name… and I didn’t get an warnings or error messages.
I mean, it makes sense. It’s like a filesystem, you can save whatever
you want. But it’s not what the calendar apps expect.
</p>
<p>
So, how do I discover the correct URL? Using a command-line
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> explorer like
<code>cadaver</code>. The following example shows how I log into
Radicale and list the contents of the two directory I found. One of them
is full of <code>.vcf</code> files (contacts), the other is full of
<code>.ics</code> files (calendar entries). That’s the one!
</p>

In the course of doing that, sometimes I’ll be working on
infrastructure—whether that’s an Ansible playbook to configure a Docker
container, or testing something on a fresh server or VM.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I run into the following error every so often in my Nginx
<code>error.log</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>"php-fpm" nginx Error: Undefined constant PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY
</code></pre>
<p>
The funny thing is, I <em>don’t</em> have that error when I’m running
CLI commands, like <code>vendor/bin/drush</code>, and can even install
and manage the Drupal site and database on the CLI.
</p>
<p>
The problem, in my case, was that I had applied <code>php-fpm</code>
configs using Ansible, but in my playbook I hadn’t restarted
<code>php-fpm</code> (in my case, on Ubuntu 22.04,
<code>php8.3-fpm</code>) after doing so. So FPM was running with
outdated config and didn’t know that the MySQL/MariaDB drivers were even
present on the system.

The lDebug debugger (spelled with a small L) is a line-oriented DOS

new progress displays for the executable depackers, and a smaller
release sources archive achieved by dropping temporary and listing
files, and building only ELDs without the XLD variants. The lDOS boot
iniload and inicomp stages can be patched using new utilities provided

ToS update allegedly locks Roku devices until users give in</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Roku customers are threatening to stop using, or to even dispose of,
their low-priced TVs and streaming gadgets after the company appears to
be locking devices for people who don’t conform to the recently updated
terms of service (ToS). This month, users on Roku’s support forums
reported suddenly seeing a message when turning on their Roku TV or
streaming device reading: “We’ve made an important update: We’ve updated
our Dispute Resolution Terms. Select ‘Agree’ to agree to these updated
Terms and to continue enjoying our products and services. Press * to
view these updated Terms.” A large button reading “Agree” follows. The
pop-up doesn’t offer a way to disagree, and users are unable to use
their device unless they hit agree. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica
The best part of this story? And by best I mean worst? You have to send
a letter – a paper one, with stamps and everything, like in the before
times – to Roku’s lawyer in California containing the names of all the
people opting out, the devices and services in question, and a damn
purchase receipt. They’re one step away from wanting your passport and
your firstborn child.</p>

<p>Journalism talks about Trump’s trials, but they are trials for the
Constitution too. If Trump is guilty (spoiler:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call">he
is</a>) then if he isn’t punished we no longer have the rule of law. So
don’t miss that we are on trial too. And – when journalism frames the
faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the
United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the
Republicans win. We know that, it’s provable. And anything that’s true
should be built into the stories journalism writes about.</p>

In collaboration with the other major browser engine developers, Mozilla

Speedometer, this benchmark measures what we think matters most for
performance online: responsiveness. But today’s release is more open and
more challenging than before, and is the best tool for driving browser
performance improvements that we’ve ever seen.

<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>From the beginning, time zone rules were a component in Mainline,
called Time Zone Data or tzdata module. This integration allowed us to
react more quickly to government-mandated time zone changes than before.
However until 2023 tzdata updates were still bundled with other Mainline
changes, sometimes leading to testing complexities and slower
deployment. In 2023, we made further investments in Mainline’s
infrastructure and decoupled the tzdata module from the other
components. With this isolation, we gained the ability to respond
rapidly to time zone legislation changes — often releasing updates to
Android users outside of the established release cadence. Additionally,
this change means time zone updates can reach a far greater number of
Android devices, ensuring you as Android users always see the correct
time. ↫ Almaz Mingaleev and Masha Khokhlova This is equal parts boring
and equal parts amazing. The amount of work developers have to put into
making sure timezones work is astonishing, and the fact that a large
chunk of it is done by volunteers is even more impressive.</p>

<h2 id="oh-servers">Oh servers!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The other day I wrote proudly that we had better more reliable server
software in 2024 than we did the first time we bootstrapped blogging
communities.
</p>
<p>
And then this happened…
</p>
<p>
We’ve been having serious problems on
<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> since Friday when I
made a software version mistake. At first it caused the server to crash
when you tried to subscribe to a new feed, so you’d get an awful error
message, either from the FeedLand website, or the browser, saying the
server had gone away. I quickly fixed that problem and another, and
restored the server to some basic functionality. But when I did some
work on my account over the weekend, I saw that there were new errors.
And then noticed that none of my feeds had updated since March 8, they
still haven’t.
</p>
<p>
We’re going to fix it this morning, by reverting the server software to
the version as it was before the update, and the server should return to
its previous reliability, Murphy-willing. Then we’re going to upgrade
the database, and then install the new software, and try again. That
won’t happen today and probably not tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Most people probably don’t know that feedland.com is a project I’m doing
with Automattic. It’s running in their cloud. This system should be able
to scale up in ways that a Digital Ocean droplet can’t, where
feedland.org and the new feedland.social are running. So when there are
many thousands of users, we should be okay. That’s why I did the work to
convert FeedLand so everything is stored in the SQL database, and
nothing in the file system, among other changes that had to be made last
year, like getting off Twitter for identity. That was not much fun, but
it had to be done.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I am very sorry and embarrassed for the unreliable performance on
our main server in the last few days. I can’t promise it won’t happen
again, but we learned a lot in this experience, and in some cases
re-learned.
</p>
<p>
It’s even worse than it appears and as they say – still diggin!

<h2 id="why-do-we-even-blog">2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-03-07-why-do-we-even-blog">
2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?
</h1>
<p>
The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined
audience. It is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It’s more
than writing into a booklet, “Dear Diary, …” – and yet we do it even if
there are no comments. Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think
I’m just as happy getting the occasional email or reply on the
fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the words is terrifying. And
once I got that first comment, once I started linking the blog from my
profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to
read and implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was
something I feared. The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart
beats. The heart bleeds.
</p>
<p>
Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments.
First, there’s a comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk
a look? But then the imagined audience is still there and now it’s
worse. How will I react as I am being watched? Blogging turns into a
performance where I feel like I’m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am
I? All the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really don’t
want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren’t very observant being unable to perceive
their own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.
</p>
<p>
The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously.
Words are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to
weight them carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It
doesn’t matter how long or how short the page, how trivial or how
controversial the topic.
</p>
<p>
And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts
unexamined and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the
judgements. How often have I found myself falling short of my own
measure.
</p>
<p>
To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for
me, for my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I
struggle for virtue and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined
reader and myself. As proof. “I struggled!” I struggle. I keep on
struggling to discover what is right and to do what is right.
</p>
<p>
Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things
that I think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my
mind. I write about the things I know because I did not know them
before. And who cares about those laborious system administration blog
posts where I struggle with this or that ephemeral problem. All these
issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People find their answers on Stack
Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized platform where middlemen
gamify the experience so that we can help each other while on the
thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I
do, when I’m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And
there are so many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved
articles and snippets are more like compost heaps, where layer upon
layer of good stuff gets dropped, never to see the light of day again.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a
fire, somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that
is fine. The world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one
thought knows not the next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion
of the sleepless mind. Our books, our journals, our blogs, our posts,
they all participate. Perhaps we fall for those waves of outrage and the
galaxy brain has a seizure as we all throw our weight around in unison,
crushing innocent lives, leaving those we hurt behind, forgetting them
as quickly as we forget about the outrage.
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one
sparking a fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and
posts on social media has certainly changed me.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and
blogging. And this is why I cannot stop blogging. To blog in that
half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and perhaps they are
not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks onto that
great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of
us can talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to
blog.
</p>
<p>
I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to
think long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing.
I keep failing and so I must keep blogging.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Writing about writing. Programming about programming. Meetings about

dysfunction, but it often produces artifacts just as unintelligible. –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That quote seemed very appropriate for one of the two threads in my
posts. The other thread is about the audience and I got a comment on
that, too, by the same author:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Not that I have much to add here, but I do relate to this one. The
ongoing tension of these feelings contrasted with the sense that (as I’m
sure I’ve said many times before) existing in public seems almost
entirely unsupportable to me now. And yet: Nothing else has quite the
same power as writing for this audience you can never be sure of. The
one that might not even exist, but if it does might be all kinds of
things.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The pain of existing in public is a great way to put it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-03-08</strong>. How to overcome that impostor feeling where
you reread that text you wrote and you want to throw it away. Not worth
the electrons it was written with! But who’s doing the judging: you, or
that imagined audience I was talking about?
</p>
<p>
I think the point of blogging is for there to be a tiny, non-threatening
audience. And really, who is going to read my blog? Internet
stranger-friends, mutuals on fedi, those kinds of people. Maybe my
parents. (Hi mom!) I can always anonymoblog somewhere else if I’m
feeling anxious. Because writing in a paper notebook I don’t feel
judged. Surely there’s a similar place, online. The key is to find that
happy state where the imagined audience adds a little zest but not the
Twitter wolves or Hacker News, or whatever the particular blogging
nightmare might be.
</p>
<p>
For me, this imagined audience is more important than getting it right.
Which is why I write my blog posts with the wiki spirit. All these sites
are pretty similar, in essence. Blog, wiki, digital garden,
Zettelkasten, there’s not enough difference to draw lines. It’s all a
question of intent, of culture, of belonging. The blog spirit is to
write pages over time, and they disappear into the archive. The digital
garden spirit is to write unfinished articles and papers, to be refined
or not. The Zettelkasten spirit is to follow the trail of thoughts you
thought and add new branches, small notes with new thoughts leading to
more thoughts on new notes. And the wiki spirit is to write and edit
online, to hit the Save button and then it’s live. There is no editor,
there is no draft. Wiki is like brutalism in content management. I can
see the page sources and the end result is obvious and full of that old
web power. It’s not an app. The software has no idea of process. The
wiki spirit is to open that window, write the text and hit save. And
then I read it again, and edit it. And tomorrow, I read it again, and
edit it. And next week, perhaps, I read it again, and edit it.
</p>
<p>
I no longer live in the
<a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiNow">Wiki Now</a>. The pages
are intended for future readers but they are not timeless. I add
timestamps all over the place. The blog spirit is strong. The pages do
disappear into the great compost of thoughts. The archive gobbles them
up. I do go back but I don’t rewrite the pages completely. I’m more
likely to simply add a timestamp and some thoughts like I did on this
page.
</p>
<p>
I do remove stuff I stumble across that I don’t like at all. I do leave
some bad things in there to remind me of bad decisions made, of bad
opinions held.
</p>
<p>
What I want to say, most of all, is that blog posts aren’t gems. They
are not precious books. They are not newspaper articles. They are not
job applications. And if I don’t like it tomorrow, I edit it. I revise
it. Or I write a new page saying how I learned something, or regret
something, or I add something. I add stuff to the bottom of pages or I
add new pages. What I don’t do is polish the old posts. There will be
more great posts in the future. The important part is the writing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-03-09</strong>. I’m reading
<a href="http://perfors.net/blog/creation-ai/">The work of creation in
the age of AI</a> by Andrew Perfors and thinking about the part where
meaning is discussed.
</p>
<p>
Meaning without an audience:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If I am writing an essay or diary entry to myself, the goal is …
generally to clarify my own thoughts, to identify flaws in my thinking,
or to distil the logic and motivations behind my ideas. I might have a
more emotional goal - I might want to vent to myself or to express a
feeling. I might want to improve my emotional regulation, feel better
about life, or change those feelings somehow.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And then with an audience:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
… once I decided I might actually want to post it, I changed it in
important ways. I included a lot more explanation of things that were
clear in my head but I thought would be non-obvious to others (and, in
so doing, often I clarified them for myself too!). I fiddled with the
structure and the argument flow, took some things out, put others in.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I got an email from
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bouncepaw">@bouncepaw</span></a> with a

</p>
<p>
This is how it starts:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This article gets better every time I open it because Alex adds
something to it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I wrote about my propensity to “add” to pages up above (I’m doing it
again!) and perhaps this would be a good place to talk about the two
“views” for this site: blog &amp; wiki.
</p>
<p>
A blog is organized by the timeline. The <a href="index">Home</a> page
lists all the pages in the order of their creation.
</p>
<p>
A wiki is organized by Recent Changes. The <a href="changes">Changes</a>
page lists all the pages recently edited (unless I unset a checkbox).
</p>
<p>
So this site has both natures. And both views have a feed:
<a href="index.rss">blog feed</a> &amp; <a href="changes.rss">wiki
feed</a>.
</p>
<p>
I think you need quite some wiki-affinity to subscribe to the wiki feed.
But it’s there for you.

id="house-panel-unanimously-approves-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok">House
panel unanimously approves bill that could ban TikTok</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>A powerful House committee advanced a bill on Thursday that could
lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok on all electronic devices,
renewing lawmakers’ challenge to one of the world’s most popular social
media apps and highlighting unresolved fears that TikTok may pose a
Chinese government spying risk. The measure that sailed unanimously
through the House Energy and Commerce Committee would prohibit TikTok
from US app stores unless the social media platform — used by roughly
170 million Americans — is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent
company, ByteDance. ↫ Brian Fung at CNN TikTok obviously needs to be
banned. It’s an extension of a genocidal, totalitarian government that
has no place on our our phones. Yes, I understand Facebook, Apple,
Google, Microsoft also collect vast amounts of data, but at least they
are (nominally) beholden to our legal systems, and while there is, of
course, a vast power imbalance between us as individuals and them as
megacorporations, it’s still nowhere even close as to being an arm of a
totalitarian government – they’re just not comparable. China’s state
surveillance tools have no place on our devices.</p>

still haven’t found whatever it is that is causing the tabs not to
respond to clicks sometimes on mobile devices on news.scripting.com and

into. It’s an on ramp to the world of collaborative feed subscriptions.
The open social web, in feeds. Which is why we call it Feed<i>Land.
</i>You know The Land of Feeds. I like “land” names for products and
companies. I started a company called UserLand a long time ago. I was
skiing in Utah in 1989 when I decided on two names: UserLand and
Frontier. I like product names that begin with F, esp if you come from
the Mac – where the <i>Finder</i> is the app you spend a lot of time in.
So Frontier was a good name simply because it was two syllables and
began with F. I know it’s weird. It’s also why FeedLand feels like a
homey name to me. :-)</p>

incident 12604</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>When this command line option is used with curl on macOS, the version
shipped by Apple, it seems to fall back and checks the system CA store
in case the provided set of CA certs fail the verification. A secondary
check that was not asked for, is not documented and plain frankly comes
completely by surprise. Therefore, when a user runs the check with a
trimmed and dedicated CA cert file, it will not fail if the system CA
store contains a cert that can verify the server! This is a security
problem because now suddenly certificate checks pass that should not
pass. ↫ Daniel Stenberg Absolutely wild that Apple does not consider
this a security issue.</p>
