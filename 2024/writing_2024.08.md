<p>Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film <strong>The Birds </strong>was based, a bit, on a Daphne du Maurier short story of the same name which itself was inspired by du Maurier’s experience seeing a farmer attacked by a flock of seagulls.

## The Year in Review 2023 by Archita Mittra

date: 2024-02-20, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Once upon a time, bad things happened and even­tually, things got better. While this might be true for certain stories, real life, plagued by ongoing pandemics and genocides, rarely offers such neat con­clusions. Perhaps that is why we repeatedly turn to art – not only to find escape and solace, but also, wisdom, empathy, and more urgently so, the will to resist and survive, despite the odds. And as the  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/the-year-in-review-2023-by-archita-mittra/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Gary K. Wolfe Reviews Kinning by Nisi Shawl

date: 2024-02-19, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Kinning</strong>, Nisi Shawl (Tor 978-1-25021-269-6, $28.99, 432pp, hc) January 2024.</p>
<p>Nisi Shawl’s 2016 <strong>Everfair </strong>was one of the more provocative alternate histories of the past de­cade, with its steampunk Africa giving birth to a safe-haven country called Everfair, carved out of the oppressively brutal Belgian Congo of King Leopold and financed in part by British social­ists and African-American missionaries. It was a sprawling, ambitious narrative, covering some 30 years  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-kinning-by-nisi-shawl/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Year in Review 2023 by Arley Sorg

date: 2024-02-19, from: Locus Magazine

<p>2023 was a bummer: We published our final issue of Fantasy Magazine in October. All the same, it was a wonderful issue, and a strong way to go out. But there was no shortage of excellent short fiction to be found elsewhere. Be­sides the many intriguing magazines regularly putting out stories, there was a wealth of books that folks who love short fiction should consider picking up.</p>

## Write On: 'Masters of the Air' Showrunner John Orloff

<p>“I always go back to theme. Why are you writing this story? What is that final couple of minutes of the movie and what do you want the audience to feel? I kind of always build backward from that in some ways. In a movie, how do I make the 118&nbsp;minutes preceding those two&nbsp;minutes build to those last two&nbsp;minutes? To me that’s a really good film. And anything that's not helping build to those last two&nbsp;minutes, throw it out!,” says John Orloff, writer/creator of <em>Masters of the Air</em>, the new nine-part series streaming on AppleTV+.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Exordia</strong>, Seth Dickinson (Tordotcom 978-1250233011, hardcover, 544pp, $29.99) January 2024</p>
<p>Seth Dickinson’s Baru Cormorant trilogy, known collectively as <b>The Masquerade, </b>was a splashy debut, earning him many accolades and fans. So when his next book, “a gonzo space opera and alien techno-thriller” titled <b>Exordia</b>, was announced in 2018, excitement grew. Six years later, after some public wistful wondering as to when the book would actually appear, <b>Exordia</b> finally  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/paul-di-filippo-reviews-exordia-by-seth-dickinson/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
