## Hubble Goes Hunting for Small Main Belt Asteroids

date: 2024-04-18, from: NASA breaking news

Like boulders, rocks, and pebbles scattered across a landscape, asteroids come in a wide range of sizes. Cataloging asteroids in space is tricky because they are faint and they don’t stop to be photographed as they zip along their orbits around the Sun. Astronomers recently used a trove of archived images taken by NASA’s Hubble […]

How long does it take to switch to writing mode, get the idea down, and return to what you were doing. The less time it takes the more <i>fluidity. </i>Twitter totally won there. And we, the bloggers, made a tradeoff. We accepted fewer features and writing in a silo because it was practical. It worked, where less fluid software didn't. So they got all the causal writing, and over time sucked the life out of blogging. I think it's time to put the fluidity back, without compromising on features and lock-in.

## COSMIC continues march towards alpha release

date: 2024-04-18, from: OS News

COSMIC, System76&#8217;s Rust-based desktop that&#8217;s going to replace GNOME in Pop!_OS, is nearing its alpha release, and the Linux OEM has published another blog post detailing the latest progress it&#8217;s made. First and foremost, theming support has been further refined by adding support for theming GTK applications (both GTK3 and 4) and flatpak applications. If the user has enabled global themes, these themes will be applied automatically whenever selecting a theme to apply. Support for custom icon packs has also been added. COSMIC now also has an application store, much like GNOME Software and KDE&#8217;s Discover, which also takes care of updating installed applications. You can now also drag windows from anywhere inside the window by holding down the super key, which is both a nice addition in general as well as a usability feature. The Settings application has also seen work, and gets a new keyboard settings panel, as well as various other smaller additions. COSMIC also now implements on-screen display toasts for things like changing volume and brightness, and plugging in power. System76 isn&#8217;t the only one working on COSMIC &#8211; community members have implemented things like window snapping, touchpad gestures, thumbnail previews in the dock, and more. The community is also working on things like an emoi picker, and a fan control graphical user interface. There&#8217;s a lot more in the blog post, so be sure to give it a read. I&#8217;m genuinely excited for COSMIC to hit the shelves, because I&#8217;m dying to try it out.

## 2024-04-17 A map generator for solo play

date: 2024-04-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-17-a-map-generator-for-solo-play">2024-04-17 A map generator for solo play</h1>

<p>Inspired by <a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social">@enfors</a> quest for a random map generator that would work for solo-gaming, where the exploration roll happens as you enter a new hex and no overall map is known beforehand, I&rsquo;ve been thinking of a <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/text-mapper/solo/random">Solo algorithm</a> for <a href="Text_Mapper">Text Mapper</a>.</p>

<p>As always, my main issue with maps is river systems. I just can’t help it! 😅 The solo-gaming constraint makes this an interesting challenge because you can’t ever go back and redo a hex that’s been discovered.</p>

<p>The first problem was that I needed a model of how the map was going to be explored to simulate the key constraint. What I use is a biased random walk of ever increasing length that keeps starting in the middle of the map, where the &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; is imagined to be. The random walk is biased in as much as it prefers to pick an unexplored hex, if possible.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-17-solo-map-1.jpg" alt="Example explorations on the map." /></p>

<p>When debugging, the numbers on the map represent the order in which the hexes are discovered, the coordinates and the altitude from 0 to 10.</p>

<p>Of course my algorithm still runs into impossible situations like rivers meeting in a local minimum that I can&rsquo;t fix because there are no take-backs. In those situations I have decided to place a cave entrance and would run it as an entrance into the underworld. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want rivers to disappear into the underworld‽</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Examples: In the map above, when entering 1008 or 1405, river flow could turn out to be problematic since all the surrounding hexes have been explored and can no longer be changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every hex has two extra data points:</p>

<ol>
<li>altitude from 0 (the deep ocean) to 10 (the highest peaks)</li>
<li>optionally, a direction of water flow (where it goes to)</li>
</ol>

<p>The strange part about this is that you cannot tell which hex is &ldquo;up river&rdquo; without actually going there and seeing whether this is where the water came from. If the next hex has no river then you followed a small creek that got smaller and smaller and finally it disappeared. If the next hex has a river that flows elsewhere, then you crossed a ridge and now you&rsquo;re in another valley.</p>

<p>When determining a random neighbour, roll a d6: 1 is north, 2 is north-east, 3 is south-east, 4 is south, 5 is south-west, 6 is north-west.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how you start the map:</p>

<ol>
<li>Roll a d6 for the <em>preferred direction</em> of water for this map.</li>
<li>Pick a hex in the middle of the map. Assign it the altitude 5.</li>
<li>Roll a d6 for the <em>direction of the local river</em>. The starting hex always has a river.</li>
<li>Roll 2d6 and <em>adjust the altitude</em> (see below).</li>
<li>Use the same 2d6 result for the check whether the new hex has <em>water flow</em> (see below).</li>
<li>Now that altitude and water flow are known, determine the terrain (see below).</li>
<li>Use the same 2d6 result for the check whether the new hex has a <em>settlement or ruin</em> (see below).
The starting hex always starts with a village.</li>
<li>When entering a new hex, go back to step 4.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="adjust-the-altitude">Adjust the altitude</h2>

<p>The provisional altitude of the new hex starts out as the altitude of where you&rsquo;re coming from (no sudden changes).</p>

<p>The altitude of the new hex is adjusted based on the 2d6 roll made above.</p>

<ol>
<li>If all the known hexes around the current hex are at altitudes 0–1, then the max altitude is 0 (deep ocean). No other factors come into play, so you can skip the rest of the altitude adjustment.</li>
<li>If there are neighbouring hexes with water flowing from there to the current hex, then their lowest altitude is the current&rsquo;s hex max altitude (because rivers don&rsquo;t flow up).</li>
</ol>

<p>Take the 2d6 roll made above and look up the altitude change on the following table:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">2d6</th>
<th align="center">Change</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">-2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">-1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">4–9</td>
<td align="center">see below</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">10</td>
<td align="center">+1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">11</td>
<td align="center">+1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">12</td>
<td align="center">+2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On a result of 4–9 it depends on the slope:</p>

<p>If coming from altitude 7 or higher, then check the direction you&rsquo;re moving in.
If you&rsquo;re moving in the direction of the preferred slope or in the opposite direction, there is no change.
If you&rsquo;re moving in a different direction, the change is -1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example: Assume the slope is &ldquo;north&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;re moving &ldquo;south&rdquo; (the opposite of &ldquo;north&rdquo;) from a hex with an altitude of 8, then there is no change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If coming from altitude 6 or lower, the check the direction you&rsquo;re moving in.
If you&rsquo;re moving in the direction of the preferred slope, the change is -1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example: Assume the slope is &ldquo;north&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;re moving &ldquo;south&rdquo; from a hex with an altitude of 6, then there is no change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea is that mountain chains form along rivers and rivers have a tendency to run towards the ocean.
Whether this actually works as intended, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Apply the change to the provisional altitude and adjust for the maximum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example: You&rsquo;re entering a new hex from a hex with altitude 5. You know is that is has a neighbouring hex with altitude 4 that has a river going towards the same hex. The max altitude is therefore a 4. Roll 2d6. If you get a 2, the change is -2 and the new hex has an altitude of 5 - 2 = 3; otherwise it has an altitude of 4 because of the max and you don&rsquo;t need to bother with anything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-17-solo-map-2.jpg" alt="A height map without the effects of water flow" /></p>

<h2 id="water-flow">Water flow</h2>

<p>If the altitude of the new hex is 0, there is no water flow (deep ocean).</p>

<p>The new hex has water flow if any of the following is true:</p>

<ol>
<li>if there is a river flowing from a neighbouring hex into the new hex;</li>
<li>if the altitude of the new hex is 1 (so that lakes can drain);</li>
<li>if the altitude is 2–8 and the 2d6 roll for altitude adjustment was a 5–8.</li>
</ol>

<p>If so, determine the direction of the water, trying one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>pick at random from the unknown neighbouring hexes and the known neighbouring hexes at a <em>lower</em> altitude with a river that doesn&rsquo;t end up in the new hex you&rsquo;re looking at (avoid circular rivers); if there is more than one candidate, prefer a hex in the direction of the <em>preferred slope</em> ±1 (to the left or right of the preferred slope);</li>
<li>pick a random, known, neighbouring hex at the <em>same</em> altitude with a river that doesn&rsquo;t end up in the new hex you&rsquo;re looking at (avoid circular rivers); if there is more than one candidate, prefer a hex in the direction of the <em>preferred slope</em> ±1 (to the left or right of the preferred slope);</li>
<li>or – &ldquo;it&rsquo;s magic!&rdquo; – just pick one from the neighbouring hexes (all of them at a higher altitude, of course) with a river that doesn&rsquo;t end up in the new hex you&rsquo;re looking at (avoid circular rivers); if there is more than one candidate, prefer a hex in the direction of the <em>preferred slope</em> ±1 (to the left or right of the preferred slope)</li>
<li>finally, if all else fails, then it&rsquo;s an <em>entrance into the underworld</em> and the river ends right here!</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Example: Entering a new hex from the south, with the preferred slope being &ldquo;north&rdquo;. The altitudes and directions of the known neighbours are as follows: current hex, 5; south (where you came from), 4; north-west, 4; north, 5. Randomly pick between north-west and north-east (an unknown hex!) since north-west is to the left of the preferred slope and north-east is to the right of the preferred slope. North is at the same altitude and south is in the wrong direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, this algorithm doesn&rsquo;t tell you whether a newly discovered hex at altitude 1 is a sweet water lake or salty coastal waters.
As mentioned above, this algorithm also doesn&rsquo;t tell you from which neighbouring hex a river comes from.</p>

## Broadcom says “many” VMware perpetual licenses got support extensions

date: 2024-04-18, from: OS News

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan this week publicized some concessions aimed at helping customers and partners ease into VMware’s recent business model changes. Tan reiterated that the controversial changes, like the end of perpetual licensing, aren&#8217;t going away. But amid questioning from antitrust officials in the European Union (EU), Tan announced that the company has already given support extensions for some VMware perpetual license holders. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I&#8217;m linking to the Ars Technica writeup here, because the original blog post from Broadcom&#8217;s CEO is effectively unreadable to me, as steeped in corpospeak as it is. The basic gist is that the storm of criticism that&#8217;s been hovering around Broadcom ever since the changes it announced to VMware&#8217;s licensing strategy isn&#8217;t going away, and even attracted the attention of the European Union. As such, Broadcom is giving existing perpetual VMware license holders some breathing room, but not much, and their plans will be executed as-is regardless. I doubt Broadcom and VMware are big and crucial enough for the full might of the EU to come down on them, so I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see any sudden turnarounds like we did with Apple and Facebook, for instance, but at least some cracks are clearly starting to show. If the aforementioned storm keeps up, pressure from customers might actually force more concessions out of Broadcom.

## Linus Torvalds really prefers tabs

date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News

Linus Torvalds really doesn&#8217;t like spaces &#8211; as in, tabs vs. spaces &#8211; and got a little annoyed that a commit removed a hidden tab because it &#8220;apparently showed breakage in some third-party kernel config parsing tool&#8221;. So, Torvalds decided to add some hidden tabs to trigger breakages like this, and is threatening to add more hidden tabs if necessary. It wasn&#8217;t clear what tool it was, but let&#8217;s make sure it gets fixed. Because if you can&#8217;t parse tabs as whitespace, you should not be parsing the kernel Kconfig files. In fact, let&#8217;s make such breakage more obvious than some esoteric ftrace record size option. If you can&#8217;t parse tabs, you can&#8217;t have page sizes. ↫ Linus Torvalds I&#8217;m not a programmer so I&#8217;m not going to wade into this debate &#8211; I have a personal Mastodon account to state it&#8217;s obviously tabs &#8211; but I did note that it seems like, at least in this commit message, Torvalds uses a double space after a period. Which is objectively the worst thing, right before Fahrenheit.

## LXQt 2.0.0 released, completes move to Qt 6

date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News

LXQt, the lightweight Qt desktop environment, has released a major new version, which brings with it a whole slew of very important changes and upgrades, with two main focal point. First and foremost, the desktop environment is now using Qt 6 across the board, meaning the transition from Qt 5 to Qt 6 is now complete. To support themes and the LXQt File Dialog for Qt5-based apps you can install libqtxdg-3.12.0, lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1, and libfm-qt-1.4.0 alongside the new Qt 6 variants for backwards compatibility. One exception here is QTerminal, whose Qt 6 port ran into some issues, so a separate Qt 6 release will come later. The second major upgrade that&#8217;s still in progress is support for Wayland. LXQt 2.0.0 brings Wayland support for PCManFM-Qt, LXQt Runner, and LXQt Desktop Notifications, and for LXQt 2.1.0 they plan to make everything else available under Wayland as well. This means that more popular desktop environment like Cinnamon and Xfce are starting to feel a little out of step when it comes to Wayland. One of the major user-facing new features is a new default menu for the panel which supports favourites, a new and improved search feature, and more.

## Microsoft installs Copilot “AI” app on Windows Servers by accident, it claims

date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News

Do you administer Windows Server machines, and were you surprised to find a Windows Copilot application on your servers, that neither you nor your users installed? Well, it turns out that Microsoft installed this application alongside an update to the Edge browser &#8211; but the company claims this is in error, and the application will be removed in a future update. Updates to Edge browser version 123.0.2420.65, released on March 28, 2024 and later, might incorrectly install a new package (MSIX) called ‘Microsoft chat provider for Copilot in Windows’ on Windows devices. Resulting from this, the Microsoft Copilot app might appear in the Installed apps in Settings menu. It is important to note that the Microsoft chat provider for Copilot in Windows does not execute any code or process, and does not acquire, analyze, or transmit device or environment data in any capacity. ↫ Windows 11 known issues and notifications The company claims this was an enablement package to prepare some Windows devices for the arrival of Copilot, and that it was unintentionally installed on devices. While it doesn&#8217;t mean Copilot was actually installed on your PC or server, it&#8217;s still a chilling reminder of who really controls your PC or server.

## Framework lays out plan to improve its firmware and software development cycle

date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News

Only two days ago we were talking about the software and firmware issues at Framework, and today the company&#8217;s CEO has announced they&#8217;re taking some pretty big steps to address these problems. When building products to last, it’s not enough to design the hardware to be repairable, upgradeable, and customizable.&#160;The overall longevity of devices as complex as modern notebooks also depends on how long the software and firmware continues to be useful. That includes compatibility updates to support newer generations hardware modules, fixes for bugs or compatibility issues found by end users, and especially patches for security vulnerabilities.&#160;We recognize that we have fallen short of where we need to be on software updates, and we are making the needed investments to resolve this. We now have a dedicated team of engineers at our manufacturing partner and a set of internal stakeholders focused on ongoing software updates for all of our products, going back to our original Framework Laptop with 11th Gen Intel Core. In the past, we were reliant on ad-hoc availability of engineering time from our suppliers (basically borrowing staffing from whichever new product development we had ongoing). This was inconsistent and resulted in slow progress. With a dedicated team, there is no longer resource contention, and we are able deliver shorter turnaround times from discovering issues to resolving them. ↫ Nirav Patel They&#8217;ve also shared exactly how the development, testing, and release process new firmware releases will work, from identifying any issues to the final release to consumers, and they&#8217;re hiring new employees focused entirely on expediting this process. They also promise to support each device for as long as their upstream silicon vendors will, but they can&#8217;t give any guarantees on how long that will be since those upstream vendors aren&#8217;t sharing details like that. All in all, I think this is about as good a response as you can get from an OEM, but as they themselves note, they&#8217;ll have to show their customers these aren&#8217;t just mere words. Assuming it pans out the way Framework is promising here, I think it&#8217;s a fair and customer-friendly process.

Engineers at L3Harris Technologies in Rochester, New York, have combined all 10 mirrors for NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Preliminary tests show the newly aligned optics, collectively called the IOA (Imaging Optics Assembly), will direct light into Roman’s science instruments extremely precisely. This will yield crisp images of space once the observatory launches. “This [&#8230;]

## Peer-to-peer Git: Radicle Seed Node on OpenBSD

date: 2024-04-17, from: mrusme blog

While Git is decentralized by design, in many cases it still depends on a
classical server-client architecture. Many projects rely on GitHub, GitLab, or
another centralized platform to host their repositories and thereby make them
available to everyone. What if we could have Git, but without depending on
*any* centralized servers at all, and instead use it peer-to-peer?

## A better, more compact UI for Firefox

date: 2024-04-17, from: OS News

Proton is Firefox’s new design, starting from Firefox 89. Photon is the old design of Firefox which was used until version 88. Proton’s overall feel is good, but there were a few things I didn’t like and wanted to improve.That’s why this project was born, and Lepton to denote light theme layer. Lepton’s photon styled is preserve Photon’s feeling while keep Original Lepton’s strengths. ↫ Firefox UI Fix GitHub page I do not like the current Firefox user interface, because even with the &#8216;compact&#8217; layout re-enabled in about:config, I find it just too bulky and wasteful of my screen real estate. I&#8217;ve been using the above Firefox user interface mod for ages now, and I can&#8217;t imagine using Firefox without it. The GitHub pages and guides are a bit of a mess and difficult to follow due to the project consisting of several overlapping different styles, but I just use the script listed here, selecting the style &#8220;2&#8221; when running the script. It won&#8217;t be for everyone, but for me, it makes Firefox nice and compact, turning it into a mouse-first interface without trying to accommodate touch. This is also by far not the only project with this goal, so if you&#8217;re using something else &#8211; feel free to list them.

## LAMENT FOR THE PLEAT

date: 2024-04-17, from: Howard Jacobson blog

The above is not a photograph of me, even as I was in my hey-day. But those are my trousers. Pleated. Pleated, reader! Pleated as trousers used to be, prior to plebeian flat-fronts which are to trousers what pug noses are to dogs. They are in a museum now, as soon will I be. We both belong to a more elegant, grander, more spacious epoch, before the advent of casual wear. Imagine Sebastian Flyte pacing the terraces of Brideshead pleatless. Or Gatsby - The Not So Great Gatsby - in crowded-crotch chinos.

## Query Parsing and Understanding

date: 2024-04-17, from: Marginallia log

Been working on improving Marginalia Search query parsing and understanding. This is going to be a pretty long update, as it&rsquo;s a few months&rsquo; work.
Apart from cleaning up the somewhat messy query parsing code, a problem I&rsquo;m trying to address is that the search engine is currently only good at dealing with fairly focused queries, they don&rsquo;t need to be short, but if you try to qualify a search that is too broad by adding more terms, it often doesn&rsquo;t produce anything useful.

Background: Even intense exercise by astronauts cannot compensate for muscle atrophy caused by microgravity. Atrophy occurs, in part, by way of an underlying mechanism that regulates calcium uptake. Recent research has shown exposure to spaceflight alters the uptake of calcium in muscles. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive these changes are not well studied. Researchers [&#8230;]

## Ubuntu 24.04 supports easy installation of OpenZFS root file-system with encryption

date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News

So with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is the ability to continue with a standard EXT4 file-system install, an encrypted file-system using LVM, or using OpenZFS with/without encryption. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS also has the ability to enjoy hardware-backed full-disk encryption with TPM as another new experimental option. Or, of course, the Ubuntu desktop installer continues supporting manual (custom) partitioning as well. ↫ Michael Larabel I just use whatever Btrfs setup Fedora automatically recommends when I let it take over a disk &#8211; file systems for desktops seems a bit like a solved problem to me personally &#8211; but I&#8217;m still curious what benefits, for instance, an OpenZFS setup could bring to a desktop user compared to Btrfs or a basic Ext4 setup. Why should a desktop user use OpenZFS?

## They’re looting the internet

date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News

This is the state of the modern internet — ultra-profitable platforms outright abdicating any responsibility toward the customer, offering not a &#8220;service&#8221; or a &#8220;portal,&#8221; but cramming as many ways to interrupt the user and push them into doing things that make the company money. The greatest lie in tech is that Facebook and Instagram are for &#8220;catching up with your friends,&#8221; because that&#8217;s no longer what they do. These platforms are now pathways for the nebulous concept of &#8220;content discovery,&#8221; a barely-personalized entertainment network that occasionally drizzles people or things you choose to see on top of sponsored content and groups that a relational database has decided are &#8220;good for you.&#8221; ↫ Edward Zitron Corporate social media has gotten so bad, they&#8217;re basically unusable. The rare times I open Facebook to like a picture my mother posted or whatever, I&#8217;m just gobsmacked by how utterly unusable it has become. I&#8217;ve never used Instagram, but whenever I accidentally end up there, I have no idea how to navigate that place. YouTube is more ads than video if you don&#8217;t pay for Premium (which I do, because I use YouTube a lot so I get enough value out of it). Twitter is barely worth a mention &#8211; it&#8217;s no surprise that a social network bought and run by a nazi is now even fuller of nazis than it already was. It&#8217;s not just social networks, either. The web as a whole feels like it&#8217;s been looted and plundered, and turned into a flyover state strip mall. Browsing the web is, for me at least, virtually impossible without autoplay blockers, my Pi-Hole, Consent-O-Matic, and settings to permanently block requests for location and notification access. The rise of &#8220;AI&#8221; has only made everything even worse, especially now that the big, wealthy content networks that, yes, own all your favourite technology news websites are also looking into it. Luckily, there&#8217;s also a countermovement brewing. I&#8217;ve focused OSNews&#8217; entire &#8220;social&#8221; strategy on Mastodon (and the various other ActivityPub tools), as it&#8217;s the only social medium that&#8217;s usable and enjoyable. With the nazis remaining on Twitter, and all the brands and influencers on Facebook (or Threads or whatever), everyone else interested in technology coalesced around the Fediverse, and it&#8217;s been a massive boon for a small website like OSNews trying to steer clear from all the SEO enshittification. There&#8217;s no spam, only relatively small, approachable brands, no influencers, no algorithms &#8211; just real, ordinary people, who also care about a usable, fair, and equitable web. I hope that OSNews can eventually be run without any ads at all, but that&#8217;s going to take a lot more consistent work from me to convince more and more people to support us through Patreon or Ko-Fi, or for companies to become sponsors. However, I am convinced it&#8217;s a better route to take than trying to chase the SEO dragon, because we all know where that leads to.

## Working together

date: 2024-04-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Each form of online discussion has a <i>grain</i> to it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls">Doc</a> and I used to <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/followsthegrain.png">talk</a> about how something "follows the grain of the web." Twitter has its own grain, formed by its character limit, what information is shared (ie number of followers in both directions). </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/26/baseballScene.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I made a list of some of the social networks I've been on starting in the mid-70s. The list is very long. And each of them had their own limits, rules and features, and each led to a certain kinds of relationships between the participants. Mail lists that gain traction always flame out. It's hard to get people to read your blog. If you make it easier it changes into something else. Instagram, Youtube, TikTok form hierarchies of influencers. I think of those as the networks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Lorenz">Taylor Lorenz</a> covers. </p>
<p>But there isn't a structure that I'm aware of that leads to people working together. It's a puzzle I keep trying to figure out. </p>
<p>We need <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether">working together</a> to survive climate change and fascism. It would be good to crack this nut. </p>
<p>One of the nicest things about ChatGPT is that it's always up for working with you. The critics of AI don't begin to understand this. As an example, I'm going to ask ChatGPT to draw a picture of people working together. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/peopleWorkingTogether.png">Here it is</a>. I didn't have to wait. It didn't look at my follower count, or my bank statement to decide if it was willing to work with me. I pay the $20 a month, and I've got a persistent always-on collaborator. </p>
<p>What got me thinking this way this morning is a bit of collaboration I did <a href="https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun">with palafo</a> (a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-laforge">human</a>) on Threads. It's remarkable. We actually did some work together. No sarcasm. It may be hard to read the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun">thread</a> but if you're curious about collaborative systems, here's a real example. Serendipitous, unplanned, but we figured something out by combining our experiences. Fantastic.</p>
<p>Later, <a href="https://werd.io/">Ben Werdmuller</a>, a person who I've gotten to know recently, is intelligent and asks good questions. He asked one <a href="https://www.threads.net/@ben.werdmuller/post/C50vyIruTCB">today</a>, how do they get the live audience on SNL to laugh when they want them to laugh. I had an idea and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C50wy5NsYD0">shared</a> it. (This was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1v5hy6/how_does_the_snl_audience_know_when_to_laugh/">discussed</a> on Reddit. I also <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/463e08c0-0380-4e65-9e6c-2742ce91f0db">checked</a> with ChatGPT.) </p>
<p>If you take away one thing from this post it's that we can collaborate with the machines, and maybe that will unlock collaboration between humans. In fact, in a way they are facilitating the collaboration. If you want to be part of the collective human intelligence, you may be thinking about the machines the wrong way. Maybe they're the most human thing we have, because AI is made up of humans, somewhat like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UPDUpjkHg0">Soylent Green</a>. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>PS: I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/cleaningAMess.png">humans working together</a> to clean up a mess. </p>
<p>PPS: Yesterday I gave <a href="https://john.onolan.org/">John O'Nolan</a> what I think is a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C5y7iVoJP4r">good idea</a> for getting his Ghost blogs federating with Threads, Mastodon et al. I didn't expect thanks or even a response, but I wonder if he even heard it. Most of the time, trying to help other people results in not even an acknowledgment that they saw it. If I were him I'd look for a painless, quick way to get maximum interop. Something like <a href="http://ghost.social/">ghost.social</a>. I'd give the same advice to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> at Automattic (in fact I think I did). </p>
<p>PPPS: I think acknowledgment is a key part of <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether">working together</a> on the web. Nothing more than "I wanted you to know I saw it" is often all that's needed to grease the skids of discourse. I've had a friendly disagreement with Manton at micro.blog about this. </p>

                <p>Someone asked me about my stance on not having comments on my blog. I’m not a fan of comments in general and I think commenting on something should be done in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Privately via email or via direct messaging</li>
<li>Publicly by posting a reply on your own website</li>
</ol>
<p>Setting up your server to send a webmention is an extra bonus point but I don’t consider that to be necessary. That’s the ideal commenting setup in my opinion but I’m sure some of you out there disagree.</p>                <hr>

## Reproducing the printer hack of Windows 95

date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News

During my daily web crawl I encountered a very interesting gif that I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. It was a hack of an unspecified version of Windows 95, which showed how to bypass the login screen with the help of the menu and printing dialog. However, after a brief check, I found a fair amount of people stating that &#8220;just hitting the cancel&#8221; button would do the same. Sharp-eyed viewers would notice that it was the very first action taken in the picture. In order to find out if the hack is real at all, I decided to reproduce it and document it for the good of the internet. ↫ David Polakovic So this hack is actually a lot more involved than I thought it was going to be, and yet, it still feels utterly insane that operating systems were this easy to get into, passwords were this easy to decrypt, and security settings were this trivial to disable. Anyway, the gif is sort-of real, in that yes, you can &#8216;hack&#8217; Windows 95&#8217;s login security through the printing and help subsystems. Things were different back then, man. I vaguely remember that my high school used to lock us out of the desktop, File Explorer, the Control Panel, and so on, making it impossible for us to access DOS or the games built into Windows 9x. I don&#8217;t remember the exact things we used to do, but most of us were aware and used several different methods of bypassing the school lockdowns just to mess around. We never did anything malicious &#8211; this is pre-internet, and we just wanted to play some Solitaire or Pinball &#8211; but anybody with malicious intent surely could&#8217;ve.

## Google’s Generic Kernel Image now required on all Android form factors

date: 2024-04-16, from: OS News

New TVs that launch with Android TV 14 or later on Linux kernel 5.15 or higher will be required to meet Google&#8217;s Generic Kernel Image (GKI) requirements in order to pass certification! This means that GKI is now enforced on all major Android form factors with AArch64 chipsets: handhelds, watches, automotive, &#38; televisions. ↫ Mishaal Rahman What this means is that all the major Android form factors will be running kernels that adhere to the GKI requirements, which means SoC and board support is not part of the core kernel, but instead achieved through loadable modules. This should, in theory, make it easier to provide long-term support.

## GHC 9.6.5 is now available

date: 2024-04-16, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.6.5 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-04-16</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.5. Binary
distributions, source distributions, and documentation are available on the
<a href="/download_ghc_9_6_5.html">release page</a>.</p>
<p>This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing some issues
found in the 9.6 series. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bumping the bundled <code>process</code> library to 1.6.19.0 to avoid a potential
<a href="https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/advisories/hackage/process/HSEC-2024-0003.md">command injection vulnerability</a> on Windows for clients of this library. This isn’t
known to affect GHC itself, but allows users who depend on the installed
version of the <code>process</code> to avoid the issue.</li>
<li>Fixing a bug resulting in the distributed <code>hsc2hs</code> wrapper using flags from the
compiler build environment (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24050">#24050</a>).</li>

## Fedora intends to fully embrace “AI”, but doesn’t address sourcing or its environmental impact

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

All weekend, I&#8217;ve been mulling over a recent blog post by Fedora Project Leader Matthew Miller, which he wrote and published on behalf of the Fedora Council. Fedora (the KDE version) is my distribution of choice, I love using it, and I consider it the best distribution for desktop use, and not by a close margin either. As such, reading a blog post in which Fedora is announcing plans to make extensive use of &#8220;AI&#8221; was bound to make me a feel a little uneasy. Miller states &#8211; correctly &#8211; that the &#8220;AI&#8221; space as it stands right now is dominated so much by hyperbole and over-the-top nonsense that it&#8217;s hard to judge the various technologies underpinning &#8220;AI&#8221; on merit alone. He continues that he believes that stripped of all the hyperbole and techbro bullshit, there&#8217;s &#8220;something significant, powerful&#8221;, and he wants to make &#8220;Fedora Linux the best community platform for AI&#8221;. So, what exactly does that look like? In addition to the big showy LLM-based tools for chat and code generation, these advances have brought big jumps for more tailored tasks: for translation, file search, home automation, and especially for accessibility (already a key part of our strategy). For example, open source speech synthesis has long lagged behind proprietary options. Now, what we have in Fedora is not even close to the realism, nuance, and flexibility of AI-generated speech. ↫ Matthew Miller Some of these are things we can all agree are important and worthwhile, but lacking on the Linux desktop. If we can make use of technologies labelled as &#8220;AI&#8221; to improve, say, text-to-speech on Linux for those who require it for accessibility reasons, that&#8217;s universally a great thing. Translation, too, is, at its core, a form of accessibility, and if we can improve machine translations so that people who, for instance, don&#8217;t speak English gain more access to English content, or if we can make the vast libraries of knowledge locked into foreign languages accessible to more people, that&#8217;s all good news. However, Fedora aims to take its use of &#8220;AI&#8221; even further, and wants to start using it in the process of developing, making, and distributing Fedora. This is where more and more red flags are starting to pop up for me, because I don&#8217;t feel like the processes and tasks they want to inject &#8220;AI&#8221; into are the kinds of processes and tasks where you want humans taken out of the equation. We can use AI/ML as part of making the Fedora Linux OS. New tools could help with package automation and bug triage. They could note anomalies in test results and logs, maybe even help identify potential security issues. We can also create infrastructure-level features for our users. For example, package update descriptions aren’t usually very meaningful. We could automatically generate concise summaries of what’s new in each system update — not just for each package, but highlighting what’s important in the whole set, including upstream change information as well. ↫ Matthew Miller Even the tools built atop billions and billions of euros of investments by Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Facebook, and similar juggernauts are not exactly good at what they&#8217;re supposed to do, and suck at even the most basic of tasks of providing answers to simple questions. They lie, they make stuff up, they bug out and produce nonsense, they&#8217;re racist, and so on. I don&#8217;t want any of that garbage near the process of making and updating the operating system I rely on every day. Miller laments how &#8220;AI&#8221; is currently a closed-source, black box affair, which obviously doesn&#8217;t align with Fedora&#8217;s values and goals. He doesn&#8217;t actually explain how Fedora&#8217;s use of &#8220;AI&#8221; is going to address this. They&#8217;re going to have to find ethical, open source models that are also of high quality, and that&#8217;s a lot easier said than done. Sourcing doesn&#8217;t even get a single mention in this blog post, even though I&#8217;m fairly sure that&#8217;s one of the two major issues many of us have with the current crop of &#8220;AI&#8221; tools. The blog post also completely neglects to mention the environmental cost of training these &#8220;AI&#8221; tools. It costs an insane amount of electricity to train these new tools, and with climate change ever accelerating and the destruction of our environment visible all around us, not mentioning this problem when you&#8217;re leading a project like Fedora seems disingenuous at best, and malicious at worst. While using &#8220;AI&#8221; to improve accessibility tools in Fedora and the wider Linux world is laudable, some of the other intended targets seem more worrisome, especially when you take into account that the blog post makes no mention of the two single biggest problems with &#8220;AI&#8221;: sourcing, and its environmental impact. If Fedora truly intends to fully embrace &#8220;AI&#8221;, it&#8217;s going to have to address these two problems first, because otherwise they&#8217;re just trying to latch onto the hype without really understanding the cost. And that&#8217;s not something I want to hear from the leaders of my Linux distribution.

## Framework’s software and firmware have been a mess, but it’s working on them

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

Framework puts a lot of effort into making its hardware easy to fix and upgrade and into making sure that hardware can stay useful down the line when it&#8217;s been replaced by something newer. But supporting that kind of reuse and recycling works best when paired with long-term software and firmware support, and on that front, Framework has been falling short. Framework will need to step up its game, especially if it wants to sell more laptops to businesses—a lucrative slice of the PC industry that Framework is actively courting. By this summer or fall, we&#8217;ll have some idea of whether its efforts are succeeding. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica A very painful read, and I&#8217;m disappointed to learn that the software support from Framework has been so lacklustre &#8211; or non-existent, to be more accurate. Leaving severel security vulnerabilities in firmware unpatched is a disgrace, and puts users at risk, while promising but not delivering updates that will unlock faster Thunderbolt speeds is just shitty. They have to do better, especially since their pitch is all about repairability and longevity. This article has made me more weary of spending any money on Framework &#8211; not that I have the money for a new laptop, because reasons &#8211; and I feel more people will feel this way after reading this.

## Radxa ROCK 5 ITX: a first look

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the ROCK 5 ITX coming soon and since then, samples of the Rockchip RK3588-based Radxa ROCK 5 ITX have been landing on doorsteps (or service points, screw you, UPS) of a lucky group of people and somehow I was one of those, so here’s a first look at Radxa’s latest Single Board Computer in a Mini ITX form-factor! It’s going to be a photo-heavy post and I make no apologies for that, it’s a very nice-looking PCB, with the black and gold colour scheme looking very stylish. I imagine that was a very conscious decision seeing as, as expected, they’re marketing this as a low-power desktop option and you probably don’t want a plain Jane motherboard taking pride of place in your new system, right? ↫ Bret Weber Now this &#8211; this, my friends, is exactly what the doctor ordered. I can&#8217;t wait for standard, ATX motherboard sporting ARM processors to become more common and readily available, hopefully standardised better than what we&#8217;re used to from the ARM world. I want my next (non-gaming) machines to be ARM-powered, and that means we&#8217;re going to need more of these ATX ARM boards, spanning wider performance levels.

## Apple’s mysterious fisheye projection

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

If you’ve read my first post about&#160;Spatial Video, the second about&#160;Encoding Spatial Video, or if you’ve used my&#160;command-line tool, you may recall a mention of Apple’s mysterious “fisheye” projection format. Mysterious because they’ve documented a&#160;CMProjectionType.fisheye&#160;enumeration with no elaboration, they stream their immersive Apple TV+ videos in this format, yet they’ve provided no method to produce or playback third-party content using this projection type. Additionally, the format is undocumented, they haven’t responded to an open question on the Apple Discussion Forums asking for more detail, and they didn’t cover it in their WWDC23 sessions. As someone who has experience in this area – and a relentless curiosity – I’ve spent time digging-in to Apple’s fisheye projection format, and this post shares what I’ve learned. ↫ Mike Swanson There is just so much cool technology crammed into the Vision Pro, from the crazy displays down to, apparently, the encoding format for spatial video. Too bad Apple seems to have forgotten that a technology is not a product, as even the most ardent Apple supporterts &#8211; like John Gruber, or the hosts of ATP &#8211; have stated their Vision Pro devices are lying unused, collecting dust, just months after launch.

## Why good external SSDs are faster with Apple silicon

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

After several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC, I have changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously I had chosen the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even though few drives ever seemed capable of achieving that up to. If you’re still needing good performance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense. But if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, you’re far better off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC’s Express 1M2, which should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a compatible hub. I much prefer the word over to up to. ↫ Howard Oakley If you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you&#8217;re looking for an external drive &#8211; this is some good advice to follow.

## Tech Time Capsule: Early 1990s Clip Art Captured an Era

date: 2024-04-15, from: Vintage Computing

Clip art collections from the early 1990s are today&#8217;s forgotten cultural time capsules, freezing life three decades ago as digital illustrations full of obsolete tech, vintage fashions, and more. Just for fun, let&#8217;s explore computer art from a time just before the Internet hit it big. [Benj&#8217;s note—I wrote this piece years ago, and it [&#8230;]

It occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a> about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn't happen, we don't even look at each others software. After waiting a whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short periods, but it's most of the time it's been people trying to deconstruct and reinvent other people's work, not build on it. I'm still open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more time.

I don't like that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and everything they (don't) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks (and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won't be any of us left, everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall, because you can't win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather they're feeding an addiction.

## GHC 9.10.1-alpha3 is now available

date: 2024-04-15, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.10.1-alpha3 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">bgamari - 2024-04-15</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability

<p>We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.</p>
<p>GHC 9.10 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The introduction of the <code>GHC2024</code> language edition, building upon
<code>GHC2021</code> with the addition of a number of widely-used extensions.</p></li>
<li><p>Partial implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/281">GHC Proposal <span>#281</span></a>, allowing visible
quantification to be used in the types of terms.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/624">Extension</a> of LinearTypes to allow linear <code>let</code> and <code>where</code>
bindings</p></li>
<li><p>The implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/330">exception backtrace proposal</a>, allowing the annotation of exceptions with backtraces, as well
as other user-defined context</p></li>
<li><p>Further improvements in the info table provenance mechanism, reducing
code size to allow IPE information to be enabled more widely</p></li>
<li><p>Javascript FFI support in the WebAssembly backend</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements in the fragmentation characteristics of the low-latency
non-moving garbage collector.</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.10.1-alpha3/docs/users_guide/9.10.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>This alpha is the penultimate prerelease leading to 9.10.1. In two weeks
we plan to publish a release candidate, followed, if all things go well,
by the final release a week later.</p>
<p>We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>

## Linux 6.10 to merge NTSYNC driver for emulating Windows NT synchronization primitives

date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News

Going through my usual scanning of all the &#8220;-next&#8221; Git subsystem branches of new code set to be introduced for the next Linux kernel merge window, a very notable addition was just queued up&#8230; Linux 6.10 is set to merge the NTSYNC driver for emulating the Microsoft Windows NT synchronization primitives within the kernel for allowing better performance with Valve&#8217;s Steam Play (Proton) and Wine of Windows games and other apps on Linux. ↫ Michael Larabel The improvements to performance of games running under Proton this new driver will bring are legitimately insane. We&#8217;re looking at a game-changing addition to the Linux kernel here, and it&#8217;s no surprise, then, to see this effort being spearheaded by companies like Valve and CodeWeavers.

## KDE’s Kate on all platforms

date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News

Kate, KDE&#8217;s programming-focused text editor, is, of course, a Qt application, and is also available on a variety of other platforms. Christoph Cullmann, one of the developers of Kate, published a short blog post with screenshots of Kate running on the three biggest platforms &#8211; Linux/BSD, Windows, and macOS. Sadly, while Haiku gets a mention, there&#8217;s no screenshot of the Haiku version of Kate. Still, it&#8217;s interesting to see the family resemblance.
