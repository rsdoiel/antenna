## Fedora intends to fully embrace “AI”, but doesn’t address sourcing or its environmental impact

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

All weekend, I&#8217;ve been mulling over a recent blog post by Fedora Project Leader Matthew Miller, which he wrote and published on behalf of the Fedora Council. Fedora (the KDE version) is my distribution of choice, I love using it, and I consider it the best distribution for desktop use, and not by a close margin either. As such, reading a blog post in which Fedora is announcing plans to make extensive use of &#8220;AI&#8221; was bound to make me a feel a little uneasy. Miller states &#8211; correctly &#8211; that the &#8220;AI&#8221; space as it stands right now is dominated so much by hyperbole and over-the-top nonsense that it&#8217;s hard to judge the various technologies underpinning &#8220;AI&#8221; on merit alone. He continues that he believes that stripped of all the hyperbole and techbro bullshit, there&#8217;s &#8220;something significant, powerful&#8221;, and he wants to make &#8220;Fedora Linux the best community platform for AI&#8221;. So, what exactly does that look like? In addition to the big showy LLM-based tools for chat and code generation, these advances have brought big jumps for more tailored tasks: for translation, file search, home automation, and especially for accessibility (already a key part of our strategy). For example, open source speech synthesis has long lagged behind proprietary options. Now, what we have in Fedora is not even close to the realism, nuance, and flexibility of AI-generated speech. ↫ Matthew Miller Some of these are things we can all agree are important and worthwhile, but lacking on the Linux desktop. If we can make use of technologies labelled as &#8220;AI&#8221; to improve, say, text-to-speech on Linux for those who require it for accessibility reasons, that&#8217;s universally a great thing. Translation, too, is, at its core, a form of accessibility, and if we can improve machine translations so that people who, for instance, don&#8217;t speak English gain more access to English content, or if we can make the vast libraries of knowledge locked into foreign languages accessible to more people, that&#8217;s all good news. However, Fedora aims to take its use of &#8220;AI&#8221; even further, and wants to start using it in the process of developing, making, and distributing Fedora. This is where more and more red flags are starting to pop up for me, because I don&#8217;t feel like the processes and tasks they want to inject &#8220;AI&#8221; into are the kinds of processes and tasks where you want humans taken out of the equation. We can use AI/ML as part of making the Fedora Linux OS. New tools could help with package automation and bug triage. They could note anomalies in test results and logs, maybe even help identify potential security issues. We can also create infrastructure-level features for our users. For example, package update descriptions aren’t usually very meaningful. We could automatically generate concise summaries of what’s new in each system update — not just for each package, but highlighting what’s important in the whole set, including upstream change information as well. ↫ Matthew Miller Even the tools built atop billions and billions of euros of investments by Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Facebook, and similar juggernauts are not exactly good at what they&#8217;re supposed to do, and suck at even the most basic of tasks of providing answers to simple questions. They lie, they make stuff up, they bug out and produce nonsense, they&#8217;re racist, and so on. I don&#8217;t want any of that garbage near the process of making and updating the operating system I rely on every day. Miller laments how &#8220;AI&#8221; is currently a closed-source, black box affair, which obviously doesn&#8217;t align with Fedora&#8217;s values and goals. He doesn&#8217;t actually explain how Fedora&#8217;s use of &#8220;AI&#8221; is going to address this. They&#8217;re going to have to find ethical, open source models that are also of high quality, and that&#8217;s a lot easier said than done. Sourcing doesn&#8217;t even get a single mention in this blog post, even though I&#8217;m fairly sure that&#8217;s one of the two major issues many of us have with the current crop of &#8220;AI&#8221; tools. The blog post also completely neglects to mention the environmental cost of training these &#8220;AI&#8221; tools. It costs an insane amount of electricity to train these new tools, and with climate change ever accelerating and the destruction of our environment visible all around us, not mentioning this problem when you&#8217;re leading a project like Fedora seems disingenuous at best, and malicious at worst. While using &#8220;AI&#8221; to improve accessibility tools in Fedora and the wider Linux world is laudable, some of the other intended targets seem more worrisome, especially when you take into account that the blog post makes no mention of the two single biggest problems with &#8220;AI&#8221;: sourcing, and its environmental impact. If Fedora truly intends to fully embrace &#8220;AI&#8221;, it&#8217;s going to have to address these two problems first, because otherwise they&#8217;re just trying to latch onto the hype without really understanding the cost. And that&#8217;s not something I want to hear from the leaders of my Linux distribution.

## Framework’s software and firmware have been a mess, but it’s working on them

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

Framework puts a lot of effort into making its hardware easy to fix and upgrade and into making sure that hardware can stay useful down the line when it&#8217;s been replaced by something newer. But supporting that kind of reuse and recycling works best when paired with long-term software and firmware support, and on that front, Framework has been falling short. Framework will need to step up its game, especially if it wants to sell more laptops to businesses—a lucrative slice of the PC industry that Framework is actively courting. By this summer or fall, we&#8217;ll have some idea of whether its efforts are succeeding. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica A very painful read, and I&#8217;m disappointed to learn that the software support from Framework has been so lacklustre &#8211; or non-existent, to be more accurate. Leaving severel security vulnerabilities in firmware unpatched is a disgrace, and puts users at risk, while promising but not delivering updates that will unlock faster Thunderbolt speeds is just shitty. They have to do better, especially since their pitch is all about repairability and longevity. This article has made me more weary of spending any money on Framework &#8211; not that I have the money for a new laptop, because reasons &#8211; and I feel more people will feel this way after reading this.

## Radxa ROCK 5 ITX: a first look

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the ROCK 5 ITX coming soon and since then, samples of the Rockchip RK3588-based Radxa ROCK 5 ITX have been landing on doorsteps (or service points, screw you, UPS) of a lucky group of people and somehow I was one of those, so here’s a first look at Radxa’s latest Single Board Computer in a Mini ITX form-factor! It’s going to be a photo-heavy post and I make no apologies for that, it’s a very nice-looking PCB, with the black and gold colour scheme looking very stylish. I imagine that was a very conscious decision seeing as, as expected, they’re marketing this as a low-power desktop option and you probably don’t want a plain Jane motherboard taking pride of place in your new system, right? ↫ Bret Weber Now this &#8211; this, my friends, is exactly what the doctor ordered. I can&#8217;t wait for standard, ATX motherboard sporting ARM processors to become more common and readily available, hopefully standardised better than what we&#8217;re used to from the ARM world. I want my next (non-gaming) machines to be ARM-powered, and that means we&#8217;re going to need more of these ATX ARM boards, spanning wider performance levels.

## GestureX: control your Linux machine with hand gestures

## Apple’s mysterious fisheye projection

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

If you’ve read my first post about&#160;Spatial Video, the second about&#160;Encoding Spatial Video, or if you’ve used my&#160;command-line tool, you may recall a mention of Apple’s mysterious “fisheye” projection format. Mysterious because they’ve documented a&#160;CMProjectionType.fisheye&#160;enumeration with no elaboration, they stream their immersive Apple TV+ videos in this format, yet they’ve provided no method to produce or playback third-party content using this projection type. Additionally, the format is undocumented, they haven’t responded to an open question on the Apple Discussion Forums asking for more detail, and they didn’t cover it in their WWDC23 sessions. As someone who has experience in this area – and a relentless curiosity – I’ve spent time digging-in to Apple’s fisheye projection format, and this post shares what I’ve learned. ↫ Mike Swanson There is just so much cool technology crammed into the Vision Pro, from the crazy displays down to, apparently, the encoding format for spatial video. Too bad Apple seems to have forgotten that a technology is not a product, as even the most ardent Apple supporterts &#8211; like John Gruber, or the hosts of ATP &#8211; have stated their Vision Pro devices are lying unused, collecting dust, just months after launch.

## Why good external SSDs are faster with Apple silicon

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

After several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC, I have changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously I had chosen the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even though few drives ever seemed capable of achieving that up to. If you’re still needing good performance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense. But if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, you’re far better off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC’s Express 1M2, which should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a compatible hub. I much prefer the word over to up to. ↫ Howard Oakley If you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you&#8217;re looking for an external drive &#8211; this is some good advice to follow.

## Tech Time Capsule: Early 1990s Clip Art Captured an Era

date: 2024-04-15, from: Vintage Computing

Clip art collections from the early 1990s are today&#8217;s forgotten cultural time capsules, freezing life three decades ago as digital illustrations full of obsolete tech, vintage fashions, and more. Just for fun, let&#8217;s explore computer art from a time just before the Internet hit it big. [Benj&#8217;s note—I wrote this piece years ago, and it [&#8230;]

It occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a> about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn't happen, we don't even look at each others software. After waiting a whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short periods, but it's most of the time it's been people trying to deconstruct and reinvent other people's work, not build on it. I'm still open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more time.

I don't like that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and everything they (don't) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks (and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won't be any of us left, everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall, because you can't win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather they're feeding an addiction.

## GHC 9.10.1-alpha3 is now available

date: 2024-04-15, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.10.1-alpha3 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">bgamari - 2024-04-15</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability

<p>We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.</p>
<p>GHC 9.10 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The introduction of the <code>GHC2024</code> language edition, building upon
<code>GHC2021</code> with the addition of a number of widely-used extensions.</p></li>
<li><p>Partial implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/281">GHC Proposal <span>#281</span></a>, allowing visible
quantification to be used in the types of terms.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/624">Extension</a> of LinearTypes to allow linear <code>let</code> and <code>where</code>
bindings</p></li>
<li><p>The implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/330">exception backtrace proposal</a>, allowing the annotation of exceptions with backtraces, as well
as other user-defined context</p></li>
<li><p>Further improvements in the info table provenance mechanism, reducing
code size to allow IPE information to be enabled more widely</p></li>
<li><p>Javascript FFI support in the WebAssembly backend</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements in the fragmentation characteristics of the low-latency
non-moving garbage collector.</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.10.1-alpha3/docs/users_guide/9.10.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>This alpha is the penultimate prerelease leading to 9.10.1. In two weeks
we plan to publish a release candidate, followed, if all things go well,
by the final release a week later.</p>
<p>We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>

## Linux 6.10 to merge NTSYNC driver for emulating Windows NT synchronization primitives

date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News

Going through my usual scanning of all the &#8220;-next&#8221; Git subsystem branches of new code set to be introduced for the next Linux kernel merge window, a very notable addition was just queued up&#8230; Linux 6.10 is set to merge the NTSYNC driver for emulating the Microsoft Windows NT synchronization primitives within the kernel for allowing better performance with Valve&#8217;s Steam Play (Proton) and Wine of Windows games and other apps on Linux. ↫ Michael Larabel The improvements to performance of games running under Proton this new driver will bring are legitimately insane. We&#8217;re looking at a game-changing addition to the Linux kernel here, and it&#8217;s no surprise, then, to see this effort being spearheaded by companies like Valve and CodeWeavers.

## KDE’s Kate on all platforms

date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News

Kate, KDE&#8217;s programming-focused text editor, is, of course, a Qt application, and is also available on a variety of other platforms. Christoph Cullmann, one of the developers of Kate, published a short blog post with screenshots of Kate running on the three biggest platforms &#8211; Linux/BSD, Windows, and macOS. Sadly, while Haiku gets a mention, there&#8217;s no screenshot of the Haiku version of Kate. Still, it&#8217;s interesting to see the family resemblance.
