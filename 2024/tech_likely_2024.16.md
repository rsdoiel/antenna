## NASAâ€™s LRO Observes 2024 Solar Eclipse Shadow

date: 2024-04-15, from: NASA breaking news

As the Moon blotted out the Sun to viewers across the United States during the April 8 solar eclipse, NASAâ€™s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) captured an image from some 223,000 miles away of the highly anticipated celestial event. There are three cameras that comprise the LRO camera (LROC) suite: two Narrow Angle Cameras (NAC) and [&#8230;]

## A blogroll on a Drummer blog

date: 2024-04-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>How to add a <a href="https://blogroll.social/">FeedLand blogroll</a> to a <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml">Drummer blog</a>. </p>

<li>The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new post, it goes to the top of the list.</li>
<li>You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items. Click on the pubdate to go to the full item on the web. </li>
<li>It supports keyboard navigation. Up and down arrows move through the list, Return to expand/collapse. </li>
<li>We're working on WordPress plugin. </li>
</ul>
<p>Four head-level attributes in your blog.opml file. Only one required. </p>

## Why good external SSDs are faster with AppleÂ silicon

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

After several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC, I have changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously I had chosen the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even though few drives ever seemed capable of achieving that up to. If youâ€™re still needing good performance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense. But if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, youâ€™re far better off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWCâ€™s Express 1M2, which should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a compatible hub. I much prefer the word over to up to. â†« Howard Oakley If you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you&#8217;re looking for an external drive &#8211; this is some good advice to follow.

## Tech Time Capsule: Early 1990s Clip Art Captured an Era

date: 2024-04-15, from: Vintage Computing

Clip art collections from the early 1990s are today&#8217;s forgotten cultural time capsules, freezing life three decades ago as digital illustrations full of obsolete tech, vintage fashions, and more. Just for fun, let&#8217;s explore computer art from a time just before the Internet hit it big. [Benj&#8217;s noteâ€”I wrote this piece years ago, and it [&#8230;]

It occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a> about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn't happen, we don't even look at each others software. After waiting a whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short periods, but it's most of the time it's been people trying to deconstruct and reinvent other people's work, not build on it. I'm still open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more time.

I don't like that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and everything they (don't) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks (and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won't be any of us left, everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall, because you can't win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather they're feeding an addiction.

## Linux 6.10 to merge NTSYNC driver for emulating Windows NT synchronization primitives

date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News

Going through my usual scanning of all the &#8220;-next&#8221; Git subsystem branches of new code set to be introduced for the next Linux kernel merge window, a very notable addition was just queued up&#8230; Linux 6.10 is set to merge the NTSYNC driver for emulating the Microsoft Windows NT synchronization primitives within the kernel for allowing better performance with Valve&#8217;s Steam Play (Proton) and Wine of Windows games and other apps on Linux. â†« Michael Larabel The improvements to performance of games running under Proton this new driver will bring are legitimately insane. We&#8217;re looking at a game-changing addition to the Linux kernel here, and it&#8217;s no surprise, then, to see this effort being spearheaded by companies like Valve and CodeWeavers.

## KDEâ€™s Kate on all platforms

Kate, KDE&#8217;s programming-focused text editor, is, of course, a Qt application, and is also available on a variety of other platforms. Christoph Cullmann, one of the developers of Kate, published a short blog post with screenshots of Kate running on the three biggest platforms &#8211; Linux/BSD, Windows, and macOS. Sadly, while Haiku gets a mention, there&#8217;s no screenshot of the Haiku version of Kate. Still, it&#8217;s interesting to see the family resemblance.
