## The Year in Review 2023 by Alex Brown

date: 2024-02-12, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>2023 </strong><strong>by Alex Brown</strong></p>
<p>In an unintentional yet perfect synchronicity of events, I’m writing this 2023 speculative fiction wrap-up on the last day of the year with a glass of Martinelli’s while waiting for the ball to drop. It was a strange, contradictory year, one with several professional wins and sev­eral more personal hardships. Going through my reading log, I got through more books this year than I thought I  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/the-year-in-review-2023-by-alex-brown/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

Also, the opposite of Funny isn't Serious. The opposite of Funny is Not Funny. You can always be funny and serious.

In an astonishingly satisfactory ending to this thread, I googled "I'll be your mirror: the collected lyrics" discovered I had bought it in Feb 2020 and it was put away safely for me until I got home to the US, 27 months later, so safely that I hadn't realised I owned it until now.

## Alexandra Pierce Reviews Chaos Terminal by Mur Lafferty

date: 2024-02-11, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Chaos Terminal, </strong>Mur Lafferty (Ace 978-0-59309-813-4, 369pp, $17.00, tp) Cover by Will Staehle. November 2023.</p>
<p>I have watched a lot of episodes of the British TV show <strong>Midsomer Murders</strong>. They follow a predict­able format: There’s the murder (or three) and the investigation, and the final triumphant reveal of whodunit. In the course of the investigation far more problems than just the murder will turn up, some of which are  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/02/alexandra-pierce-reviews-chaos-terminal-by-mur-lafferty/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
