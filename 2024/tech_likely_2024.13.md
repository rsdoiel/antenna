Created by the showrunners for Game of Thrones based on a much-loved series of science fiction <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Remembrance-Earths-Past/dp/0765377063/ref=asc_df_0765377063/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312060985096&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15582809728247648297&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1023481&hvtargid=pla-436205129938&psc=1&mcid=fd291eb8801c3454ba521d208aecfa55&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwYSwBhDcARIsAOyL0fhXFVjlsGDRZIUki5AtcJFtzJRfInFmvebKA5HUA6OZ-7F4yC6xUnAaAqxYEALw_wcB">novels</a>, which btw I have not read. This was emphatically not Game of Thrones, though some of the actors played roles in both series, and in each case that was awkward. Not the best actors, they didn't get much screentime in GoT, but here, they get the big lines and omg it was embarrassing, they don't pull it off. Creepy. I loved the first four episodes, incredible story, and the special effects, awesome. Then it really started to stink in episodes in 6 and 7, endless stupid dialog with music that made every stupid thing like a climax of a sort. But I was still watching, and then it came back roaring in the final episode. On the other hand it's like so much of today's TV, superheros, epic conflicts, resolution, good guys win. A cross between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(2004_TV_series)">Lost</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game">Ender's Game</a>. A space adventure and the supernatural. Net-net -- it <i>was</i> worth it. A good distraction, I will probably watch Season 2.

## EU opens non-compliance investigations against Alphabet, Apple and Meta under the Digital Markets Act

date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News

It turns out Apple, Facebook, and Google were not as clever with their malicious compliance with the European Union&#8217;s DMA as they thought they were, as the European Commission has opened investigations into their compliance plans. Especially Apple, who has been most public about its malicious compliance, seems to be the target. Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet&#8217;s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple&#8217;s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta&#8217;s “pay or consent model”. The Commission suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA. In addition, the Commission has launched investigatory steps relating to Apple&#8217;s new fee structure for alternative app stores and Amazon&#8217;s ranking practices on its marketplace. Finally, the Commission has ordered gatekeepers to retain certain documents to monitor the effective implementation and compliance with their obligations. ↫ European Commission press release This is entirely unsurprising. Google&#8217;s and Facebook&#8217;s compliance plans were less scrutinised in the press, but all still raised questions about whether they would pass mustard. Apple&#8217;s plans, meanwhile, were universally seen as deeply malicious and not compliant, and it seems the European Commission agrees. Apple&#8217;s continuous wild, flailing attacks on the EU and the DMA certainly aren&#8217;t helping, either. There&#8217;s no denying Apple&#8217;s behaviour has been deeply unprofessional and anti-European Union, which contrasts strongly with how Apple and Tim Cook operate in China, where they face much stricter rules than they do in the EU. Tim Cook is currently in China praising and buttering up to the Chinese totalitarian regime, while the company has been attacking the European Union and DMA almost non-stop for months now. It really shows where Apple&#8217;s priorities lie. Meanwhile, Facebook&#8217;s pay-for-privacy model was always going to be a hard sell at €10 a month, and as such, the company already announced it was going to cut that cost in half. Google&#8217;s plans are a bit more nebulous, since it&#8217;s a bit more difficult to see tangible results from things like search rankings, but it seems here, too, the European Commission has its worries about compliance. The European Commission intends to complete its investigations within a year, and if found in violation of the law, companies can be fined for up to 10% of their worldwide turnover, which can grow up to 20% for repeated infringements.

## Floorp Firefox fork makes its modifications closed source due to forks

date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News

Recently, a few people suggested I give the browser Floorp a try, a Firefox fork with some additional UI changes and additions. Since it was based on Firefox ESR, however, I saw no point in even trying it, because I prefer to be on the latest Firefox release. It seems I accidentally made the right choice, since yesterday the developers behind Floorp decided to take their modifications closed source. The appearance of Floorp forks &#8211; which, may I remind you, is a fork itself &#8211; seems to be the cause. I know it’s not nice of me to say, but Floorp has been in too much demand. It am surprise to me that companies and organizations would fork a fork that I had created when I was still a teenager, and at first I was happy about it, but it was not beneficial to me, and on the contrary, it was mentally draining. There were forks that wanted to hide the fact that they were Floorp forks, forks that did not want to contribute to Floorp at all, forks that used the code for life and just changed the name of Floorp, and many other forks were born. ↫ Floorp blog It seems the developer of Floorp is rather young, and started the project as a teenager, and as such, I don&#8217;t think we should be too harsh on them &#8211; I did some dumb things as a teenager &#8211; but complaining about forks of your own fork seems a bit disingenuous, regardless of how young and inexperienced you are. I understand seeing your work forked into competing browsers can be frustrating, but it&#8217;s a core part of the open source world, especially if you yourself owe your product to forking, too.

## Sources: iOS 18 lets users customize layout of home screen app icons

date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News

While app icons will likely remain locked to an invisible grid system on the Home Screen, to ensure there is some uniformity, our sources say that users will be able to arrange icons more freely on iOS 18. For example, we expect that the update will introduce the ability to create blank spaces, rows, and columns between app icons. ↫ Joe Rossignol at MacRumors It&#8217;s 2024 and iOS&#8217; Springboard is slowly catching up to the Palm OS launcher. I&#8217;m drowning in the innovation here.

One of them has an old villa previously owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Emden">some rich dude</a> but now owned by the canton and turned into a restaurant, a hotel and the island itself turned into a botanical garden.</p>

<p>This pond had fantastic frogs.</p>

Linkblogs and blogrolls go together really well. Blogrolls work best for smaller groups of people and projects, not the huge number of followers people have on the twitter-like social web. But I think even a few hundred items in a blogroll work, as long as it's dynamic, and it's reverse chronologic.

Never thought I'd be so glad to see the <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">xml-rpc site</a> back up and running. I found out about it being off by someone sending an email asking if they could buy the domain from me. Otherwise I'm not sure I would have noticed. The whole idea is to put these static sites in a safe place and forget about it. But clearly there are no safe places and someday you might get dragged back to try to debug some work you did a bunch of years ago.

## Hyprland crash course

date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News

For the past week I have been configuring hyprland and using it as my daily driver. Coming from major Desktop Environments like KDE or Gnome, this was definitely quite challanging, specially when implementing features that we take it for granted on these DEs, like screen sharing or screenshot annotating. In this post I will be going through all the tools and scripts I have been creating to configure this amazing Window Manager to my liking. ↫ xd1.dev Like I mentioned in my MNT Reform review, I&#8217;m not a fan of these &#8220;build your own desktop environment&#8221; window managers and related tools, but there&#8217;s no denying they&#8217;re quite popular.

## The Mind Khadas: a modular PC

date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News

I saw this on a Linus Tech Tips video today, and it&#8217;s pretty neat: the Khadas Mind is a tiny computer powered by an Intel Core i5-1340P or Core i7-1360P, but it has a souped-up PCIe connector at the bottom that allows you to hook it up to all kinds of other devices, like a graphics card, a dock, and so on. It looks slick and quite user-friendly, and according to the LTT video, the company intends to release the specs for the connector so that third parties can hook into it as well, but a promise is just that &#8211; a promise. It&#8217;s way too early to tell if this will go anywhere &#8211; past attempts would suggest that sadly, it won&#8217;t &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not an incredibly awesome and seemingly workable implementation of the modular PC idea.

date: 2024-03-24, updated: 2024-03-24, from: Newsboat News


            <p>
                Another quarter, another Newsboat release!
            </p>

            <p>
		The highlight for this one is Feedbin support. Feedbin is an
		online newsreading service in the vein of Google Reader, and we
		already support a bunch of similar ones. The feature request
                for Feedbin specifically was filed 4 years ago, and upvoted
		19 times — twice more often than the runner-up, a request for
		separators between groups of feeds. We‘ve been waiting for an
		interested person to tackle this, and finally James Vaughan
                showed up with a complete implementation. Please give it a spin
		if you‘ve been waiting for this functionality all these years,
                and thanks for your patience!
            </p>

            <p>
		Another notable feature is support for item starring with
		Miniflux. This was on the to-do list for a while too, and was
		implemented by gilcu3. Interestingly, both of these are first
		ever contributions; it‘s very nice to see new faces in
                Newsboat‘s pull requests!
            </p>

            <p>
		There‘s also a few new scripts in the contrib directory, and
		loads of internal reworking by Dennis van der Schagt and others.
		Probably some new bugs too, but Juho Eerola fixed one in 2.35,
                so let‘s call it even, ok?
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, enough chatter; go grab the source:

## Digital wallets and the “only Apple Pay does this” mythology

date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News

I hope what you take away from this post is that while Apple Pay is a great way to pay for things and that Apple did a great job mainstreaming digital wallets like this, what they do is not unique in the industry. DPANs are great for making it harder to track one person’s purchases across multiple merchants and they make customers less at risk in the event of a data breach of payment card info. ↫ Matt Birchler The gist of the article is that all the things Apple claims are unique about Apple Pay are really not unique at all, and quite a few things Apple touts are just flat-out lies, such as merchants being unable to know what you buy or people being unable to track you when you use Apple Pay. Other digital wallets, from Google, Samsung, and others, work in the exact same way Apple Pay does, and even banks and similar companies implement their payment systems the way Apple Pay does. It&#8217;s a case study in how Apple&#8217;s marketing and PR bloggers manage to perpetuate a myth solely because so many people just assume it must be true. Apple wouldn&#8217;t lie, right?

<p>I have followed the Palestinian struggle since about 2000 and read every book I could on the subject.</p><p>But TikTok has really made this knowledge accessible to the public.  The TikTokers know how to explain in small bursts like nothing I have seen before. </p><p>Accurate and concise.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/299">Braintrust query</a>: I have not been able to reliably get to a bunch of my sites that use HTTP this morning. For example, <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://techfightclub.wordpress.com/feed/">feeder.scripting.com</a>, a site that I use to test feeds. Also <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">xmlrpc.com</a>. It's possible that something broke overnight in my server. Or Digital Ocean is having a problem? Doesn't seem like it's something Google is doing to punish me for using HTTP, though that is always the first thing that comes to mind. I tried moving the XML-RPC site to a different server, but the problem follows it. No changes have been made to the site in years. Not exactly what I had planned to be digging into on a nice (but cold) Sunday morning in the mountains. I started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/299">thread</a>, if you have any insights. At least scripting.com is still working, but it's not served through my software or Digital Ocean.

## Another day, another paean of praise for the Amiga's 1980s pre-emptive multitasking GUI

date: 2024-03-24, from: Liam on Linux

<div>Yes, the Amiga offered a GUI with pre-emptive multitasking, as early as 1985 or so. And it was affordable: you didn't even need a hard disk.<br /><span class="commtext c00"><p>The thing is, that's only part of the story.</p><p>There's  a generation of techies who are about 40 now who don't remember this  stuff well, and some of the older ones have forgotten with time but  don't realise. I had some greybeard angrily telling me that floppy  drives were IDE recently. Senile idiot.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>Preemptive multitasking is only part of the story. Lots of systems had it. Windows <i>2.0</i> could do preemptive multitasking -- but only of DOS apps, and only in the base 640kB of RAM, so it was pretty useless.</p><p>It  sounds good but it's not. Because the other key ingredient is memory  protection. You need both, together, to have a compelling deal. Amiga  and Windows 2.x/3.x only had the preemption part, they had no hardware  memory management or protection to go with it. (Windows 3.x <i>when running on a 386</i> and also <i>when given &gt;2MB RAM</i> could do some, for DOS apps, but not much.)</p><p>Having  multiple pre-emptive tasks is relatively easy if they are all in the  same memory space, but it's horribly horribly unstable.</p><p>Also see:  microkernels. In size terms, AmigaOS was a microkernel, but a  microkernel without memory protection is not such a big deal, because  the hard part of a microkernel is the interprocess communication, and if  they can just do that by reading and writing each other's RAM it's  trivially easy but also trivially insecure and trivially unstable.</p><p>RISC  OS had pre-emptive multitasking too... but only of text-only  command-line windows, and there were few CLI RISC OS apps so it was  mostly useless. At least on 16-bit Windows there were lots of DOS apps  so it was vaguely useful, if they'd fit into memory. Which only trivial  ones would. Windows 3 came along very late in the DOS era, and by then,  most DOS apps didn't fit into memory <i>on their own</i> one at a time. I  made good money optimising DOS memory around 1990-1992 because I was  very good at it and without it most DOS apps didn't fit into 500-550kB  any more. So two of them in 640kB? Forget it.</p><p>Preemption is clever. It lets apps that weren't designed to multitask do it.</p><p>But it's also <i>slow</i>. Which is <i>why</i>  RISC OS didn't do it. Co-op is much quicker  which is also why OSes like RISC OS and 16-bit Windows chose it for  their GUI apps: because GUI apps strained the resources of  late-1980s/very-early-1990s computers. So you had 2 choices:</p><p>&bull; The Mac and GEM way: don't multitask at all.</p><p>&bull; The 16-bit Windows and RISC OS way: multitask cooperatively, and hope nothing goes wrong.</p><p>Later,  notably, MacOS 7-8-9 and Falcon MultiTOS/MiNT/MagiC etc added coop  multitasking to single-tasking GUI OSes. I used MacOS 8.x and 9.x <i>a lot</i> and I really liked them. They were extraordinarily usable to an extent Mac OS X has never and will never catch up with.</p><p>But  the good thing about owning a Mac in the 1990s was that at least one  thing in your life was guaranteed to go down on you every single day.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></span></div><div>(Repurposed from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39806580">a HN comment</a>.)<br />&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=90834" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments
