## 2024-03-27 Sick? Or Hayfever?

<h1 id="2024-03-27-sick-or-hayfever">2024-03-27 Sick? Or Hayfever?</h1>

<p>Back from the trip to Locarno and I‚Äôm feeling sick. The nose, the frontal sinus cavity, ouch.</p>

<p>But strangely enough, the birch pollen season has also started. So what is it?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-03-26-sick-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>(Z√ºrich is super dark red.)</p>

<p>The report says:</p>

<p>‚ÄúEschen und Birken bl√ºhen fr√ºhzeitig in der gesamten Schweiz, und f√ºr deren Pollen werden in den kommenden Tagen im Flachland und in mittleren Lagen m√§ssige bis starke Belastungswerte erwartet.‚Äù</p>

<p>Ash and birch are in bloom earlier than usual.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll take one of these Cetirizine-based hayfever pills, drink another cup of herbal infusion and go back to bed.
Hopefully at least one of these things will help.</p>

## Infinite Mac: turning to the dark side

date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News

About a year ago I came across the Previous emulator ‚Äì it appeared to be a faithful simulation of the NeXT hardware and thus capable of running NeXTStep. While including it in Infinite Mac would be scope-creep, NeXT‚Äôs legacy is in many ways more relevant to today‚Äôs macOS than classic Mac OS. It also helped that it‚Äôs under active development by its original creator (see the epic thread¬†in the NeXT Computers forums), and thus a modern, living codebase. Previous is the fifth emulator that I‚Äôve ported to WebAssembly/Emscripten and the Infinite Mac runtime, and it‚Äôs gotten easier. As I&#8217;m doing this work, I‚Äôm developing more and more empathy for those doing Mac game ports ‚Äì some things are really easy and others become yak shaves due to the unintended consequences of choices made by the original developers. Previous is available on multiple platforms and has good abstractions, so overall it was a pretty pleasant experience. ‚Ü´ Mihai Parparita By porting previous to WebAssembly/Emscripten, Infinite Mac now offers access to a whole slew of NeXTSTEP releases, from the earliest known release to the last one from 1997. There&#8217;s also a ton of applications added to make the experience feel more realistic. This makes Infinite Mac even more useful than it already was, ensuring it&#8217;s one of the best and easiest ways to experience old macOS and now NeXTSTEP releases through virtual machines (real ones, this time), available in your browser. I&#8217;ll be spending some time with these new additions for sure, since I&#8217;ve very little experience with NeXTSTEP other than whatever I vicariously gleamed through Steven Troughton-Smith&#8216;s toots on the subject over the years. Mihai Parparita is doing incredibly important work through Infinite Mac, and he deserves credit and praise for all he&#8217;s doing here.

## Happy birthday APFS, 7 years old¬†today

date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News

Seven years ago, on 27 March 2017, Apple introduced one of the most fundamental changes in its operating systems since Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah was released 16 years earlier. On that day, those who updated iOS to version 10.3 had their iPhone‚Äôs storage silently converted to the first release of Apple File System, APFS. Six months later, with the release of macOS 10.13 High Sierra on 25 September, Mac users followed suit. ‚Ü´ Howard Oakley The migration from HFS+ to APFS is still an amazing feat for Apple to have pulled off. Hundreds of millions devices converted from one filesystem to another, and barely anyone noticed &#8211; no matter how you look at it, that&#8217;s an impressive achievement, and the engineers who made it possible deserve all the praise they&#8217;re getting.

<p>We&rsquo;re looking after Patches, my brother-in-law&rsquo;s dog, &ldquo;for the long weekend&rdquo; (until next Tuesday). He hasn&rsquo;t met Gidget before, and got himself bapbapbapped when he tried to give her a customary canine friendly greeting (sniffing her bum). Gidget was FURIOUS! After some time apart they settled down, though. Patches took a nap, and Gidget decided beating him up could be deferred in favour of just watching him like a hawk, and now they&rsquo;re <em>both</em> snoozing peacefully on the couch. What a relief üòÖ</p>

## Plasma 5: the early years

date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News

With KDE‚Äôs 6th Mega Release finally out the door, let‚Äôs reflect on the outgoing Plasma 5 that has served us well over the years. Can you believe it has been almost ten years since Plasma 5.0 was released? Join me on a trip down memory lane and let me tell you how it all began. This coincidentally continues pretty much where my previous retrospective blog post concluded. ‚Ü´ Kai Uwe It took them a few years after the release of Plasma 5.0, but eventually they won me over, and I&#8217;m now solid in the KDE camp, after well over a decade of either GNOME or Cinnamon. GNOME has strayed far too much away from just being a traditional desktop user interface, and Cinnamon is dragging its heels with Wayland support, but luckily KDE has spent a long time now clearing up so many of the paper cuts that used to plague them every time I tried KDE. That&#8217;s all in the past now. They&#8217;ve done a solid job cleaning up a lot of the oddities and inconsistencies during Plasma 5&#8217;s lifecycle, and I can&#8217;t wait until Fedora 40 hits the streets with Plasma 6 in tow. In the desktop Linux world, I feel KDE and Qt will always play a little bit of second fiddle to the (seemingly) much more popular GNOME and GTK+, but that&#8217;s okay &#8211; this kind of diversity and friendly competition is what makes each of these desktops better for their respective users. And this is the Linux world, after all &#8211; you&#8217;re not tied down to anything your current desktop environment does, and you&#8217;re free to switch to whatever else at a moment&#8217;s notice if some new update doesn&#8217;t sit well with you. I can&#8217;t imagine using something like macOS or Windows where you have to just accept whatever garbage they throw at you with nowhere to go.

## Canonical expands Long Term Support to 12 years starting with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News

Today, Canonical announced the general availability of Legacy Support, an Ubuntu Pro add-on that expands security and support coverage for Ubuntu LTS releases to 12 years. The add-on will be available for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onwards.&#160; Long term supported Ubuntu releases get five years of standard security maintenance on the main Ubuntu repository. Ubuntu Pro expands that commitment to 10 years on both the main and universe repositories, providing enterprises and end users alike access to a vast secure open source software library. The subscription also comes with a phone and ticket support tier. Ubuntu Pro paying customers can purchase an extra two years of security maintenance and support with the new Legacy Support add-on. ‚Ü´ Canonical blog Assuming all of this respects the open source licenses of the countless software packages that make up Ubuntu, this seems like a reasonable way to offer quite a long support lifecycle for those that really need it. Such support doesn&#8217;t come free, and it I think it&#8217;s entirely reasonable to try and get compensated for the work required in maintaining that level of support for 10 or 12 years. If you want this kind of longevity from your Linux installation without paying for it, you&#8217;ll have to maintain it yourself. Seems reasonable to me.

On the whole, it was a really enjoyable time and I&#8217;d like to have the chance to do so again at some point. One of the least enjoyable experiences from that time was to deal with big CSV exports. Unfortunately, this file format is still very common in the data science space. It is easy to understand why &#8212; it seems to be ubiquitous, present everywhere, it&#8217;s human-readable, it&#8217;s less verbose than options like JSON and XML, it&#8217;s super easy to produce from almost any tool. What&#8217;s not to like? ‚Ü´ Robin K√•veland I&#8217;m not going to pretend to be some sort of expert on this matter, but even as a casual it seems CSV isn&#8217;t exactly scalable to large data sets. It seems to work great for smaller exports and imports for personal use, but any more complicated matters it seems wholly unsuited for.

## Maddow didn't go far enough

date: 2024-03-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/26/maddow.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I don't usually watch Maddow on Monday nights. I lost my faith in her when she went after Facebook a few years ago, not that Facebook didn't deserve her attention, but her arguments while condemning them were exaggerated. I knew the facts, she left out important details. </p>
<p>She steered viewers into believing things that weren't true. Didn't exactly lie, but pretty close. I figured if she does that for stories I know, then she's probably doing it other times when I wasn't so well informed. </p>
<p>But the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/03/25/knicks-donte-divincenzo-franchise-record-pistons-nba/">Knicks</a> were blowing out the Pistons on the next channel over, and I had tuned in Jen Psaki, who as luck would have it, at the exact moment I switched, was explaining how the fact that she served in the Biden Administration before joining MSNBC was very different from the controversy over Ronna McDaniel, who Maddow went on to explain was basically a terrorist and traitor and Trump co-conspirator (not just an enabler), and not in a war that was over, but one that was still being fought, and not insignificant because this fascist movement has control of one of the two major parties in the US and McDaniel was instrumental in that. There are good arguments that she should be in a prisoner of war camp, not employed by one of America's major news networks.</p>
<p>That NBC hired McDaniel as a contributor says something awful about Maddow's employer. And Maddow, if she has any details on that, isn't saying what they are. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/26/cartoonChicken.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've had this problem with other reporters in the past whose owners were caught up in some controversy that made them newsworthy. The reporters refused to cover it, or even be a source for others who were. This is where journalism goes wrong imho. Maddow <i>should</i> know the details, and if she does, she is obligated to share them, because they are significant, and go to how much trust any of us should give to any news coming to us from NBC. Maybe she has to quit to do that, and if so, go ahead and quit. Because the shadow it casts over everything touched by NBC, which includes MSNBC and Maddow is just too freaking long. It's similar to the "news" she reported on Facebook, except now instead of steering us to believe lies, she's holding it back, and instead of it being about one very powerful social media company, it's about the future of the government of the US. And maybe she doesn't know, as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">Upton Sinclair</a> once said: ‚ÄúIt is difficult to get a [person] to understand something, when [their] salary depends on [them] not understanding it.‚Äù </p>
<p>I don't blame Maddow for liking her job. But as a reporter, there are more and more reasons not to trust her and esp to not trust the company that employs her. When it was obvious she wasn't going to tell us the story behind McDaniel's hiring, or even name the people responsible for it, I switched back to the Knicks, where at least I think I understand who they are and what they're trying to do.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/240326/p49#a240326p49">Update</a>: MSNBC <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/26/nbc-news-ronna-mcdaniel-commentator">backed down</a> on hiring McDaniel. </p>

## Run Windows 95 to XP, Mac OS 8.6 to 10.4 in your browser, sort of

date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News

Complete desktops contain all operating system components as well as Internet Explorer and Outlook Express. Where possible, I have tried to include built in file transfer programs (Web Publishing Wizard, Web Folders), useful system tools (System File Checker, System Restore) and certain wizards (Network Setup Wizard, Internet Connection Wizard). As a result, some of the desktops are quite large and can take some time to load. ‚Ü´ VirtualDesktop.org These are easily loaded virtual machines  inside your browser, for various versions of Windows and macOS. There&#8217;s more and more of these websites now, and while I don&#8217;t use them for anything, they&#8217;re still quite handy in a pinch. And let&#8217;s face it &#8211; it&#8217;s still kind of magical to see entire operating systems running inside a browser. The website also has several virtual machines without applications, and application-specific virtual machines, too, focused on browsers and mail clients.

In Google‚Äôs First Tensor Processing Unit &#8211; Origins, we saw why and how Google developed the first Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU v1) in just 15 months, starting in late 2013.

## SysV init 3.09 released

date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News

Most of the Linux world has moved to systemd by now, but there are still quite a few popular other init systems, too. One of those is the venerable SysV init, which saw a brand new release yesterday. The biggest improvement also seems like it&#8217;ll enable a match made in heaven: SysVinit, but with musl. On Linux distributions which use the musl C library (instead of glibc) we can now build properly. Specifically, the hddown helper program now builds on musl C systems. ‚Ü´ SysVinit 3.09 release notes It&#8217;s important init systems like SysV init and runit don&#8217;t just die off or lose steam because of the systemd juggernaut, as competition, alternatives, and different ideas are what makes open source what it is.

## C64 OS gets hidden files, here‚Äôs how it works

date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News

Version 1.06 is a more modest release than 1.05 or 1.04. But I think that&#8217;s okay. v1.06 includes one new Application, three new Utilities and new features and improvements to several existing Apps and Utilities, and even some new low-level features in the KERNAL and libraries. This latest release makes use of a combination of all of the above to provide a handy new feature for users and a potentially powerful and useful feature for developers, when put to creative uses at a low-level. Discussions of just this nature have already been spurred on in the developer forums on the C64 OS Discord server. That feature is: Hidden Files. ‚Ü´ Greg Na√ßu C64 OS is a marvel of engineering, and what the developers are managing to squeeze out of the C64 is stunning. This article delves deep into how hidden files were implemented in the latest release.

## ‚ÄúTemporary‚Äù disk formatting UI from 1994 still lives on in Windows 11

date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News

Windows 11 has done a lot to update and modernize long-neglected parts of Windows&#8217; user interface, including many Settings menus and venerable apps like Notepad and Paint. But if you dig deep enough, you&#8217;ll still find parts of the user interface that look and work like they did in the mid-&#8217;90s, either for compatibility reasons or because no one ever thought to go back and update them. Former Microsoft programmer Dave Plummer shared some history about one of those finely aged bits: the Format dialogue box, which is still used in fully updated Windows 11 installs to this day when you format a disk using Windows Explorer. ‚Ü´ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica There&#8217;s a lot of old stuff left inside Windows, which is basically a layer cake of various user interface themes Microsoft fancied over the years. I delved into the history of another old Windows program 9 years ago: the Character Map.

## Writing about writing

date: 2024-03-25, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Meta posting is fun. I love to blog about blogging. My brain enjoys a good recursion. One thing I don‚Äôt do is write about writing. That‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a good writer. As I wrote before, <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/i-am-not-a-writer">I don‚Äôt even think I am a writer</a>. Sure, I write, but that doesn‚Äôt make me a writer.</p>
<p>I do love when people write about writing. I‚Äôm enjoying reading Ratika‚Äôs <a href="https://kadambari.bearblog.dev/blog/">series/book/in-progress-digital-project</a>‚Äî<a href="https://ko-fi.com/ratikadeshpande">support if you can</a>‚Äîand I appreciate when people write and share more about their creative processes. It‚Äôs fun to see how other people‚Äôs brains work.</p>
<p>That said though, <a href="https://www.conscienceround.com">someone</a> emailed me earlier today asking if I knew other people‚Äîor other online places‚Äîwhere writers write about writing. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt but I‚Äôm sure some of you out there do so I‚Äôm gonna use this space to bounce the questions to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>do you know any personal blogs about writing and by writers?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>This is what I got back so far. These are not sites that are exclusively about the topic of writing but they do contain posts on the subject.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/25/starof3bodyproblemcantrecallhisname.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I was glad to have <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/3-body-problem/">3 Body Problem</a> to binge over the weekend. Created by the showrunners for Game of Thrones based on a much-loved series of science fiction <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Remembrance-Earths-Past/dp/0765377063/ref=asc_df_0765377063/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312060985096&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15582809728247648297&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1023481&hvtargid=pla-436205129938&psc=1&mcid=fd291eb8801c3454ba521d208aecfa55&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwYSwBhDcARIsAOyL0fhXFVjlsGDRZIUki5AtcJFtzJRfInFmvebKA5HUA6OZ-7F4yC6xUnAaAqxYEALw_wcB">novels</a>, which btw I have not read. This was emphatically not Game of Thrones, though some of the actors played roles in both series, and in each case that was awkward. Not the best actors, they didn't get much screentime in GoT, but here, they get the big lines and omg it was embarrassing, they don't pull it off. Creepy. I loved the first four episodes, incredible story, and the special effects, awesome. Then it really started to stink in episodes in 6 and 7, endless stupid dialog with music that made every stupid thing like a climax of a sort. But I was still watching, and then it came back roaring in the final episode. On the other hand it's like so much of today's TV, superheros, epic conflicts, resolution, good guys win. A cross between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(2004_TV_series)">Lost</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game">Ender's Game</a>. A space adventure and the supernatural. Net-net -- it <i>was</i> worth it. A good distraction, I will probably watch Season 2.

## EU opens non-compliance investigations against Alphabet, Apple and Meta under the Digital Markets Act

date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News

It turns out Apple, Facebook, and Google were not as clever with their malicious compliance with the European Union&#8217;s DMA as they thought they were, as the European Commission has opened investigations into their compliance plans. Especially Apple, who has been most public about its malicious compliance, seems to be the target. Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet&#8217;s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple&#8217;s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta&#8217;s ‚Äúpay or consent model‚Äù. The Commission suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA. In addition, the Commission has launched investigatory steps relating to Apple&#8217;s new fee structure for alternative app stores and Amazon&#8217;s ranking practices on its marketplace. Finally, the Commission has ordered gatekeepers to retain certain documents to monitor the effective implementation and compliance with their obligations. ‚Ü´ European Commission press release This is entirely unsurprising. Google&#8217;s and Facebook&#8217;s compliance plans were less scrutinised in the press, but all still raised questions about whether they would pass mustard. Apple&#8217;s plans, meanwhile, were universally seen as deeply malicious and not compliant, and it seems the European Commission agrees. Apple&#8217;s continuous wild, flailing attacks on the EU and the DMA certainly aren&#8217;t helping, either. There&#8217;s no denying Apple&#8217;s behaviour has been deeply unprofessional and anti-European Union, which contrasts strongly with how Apple and Tim Cook operate in China, where they face much stricter rules than they do in the EU. Tim Cook is currently in China praising and buttering up to the Chinese totalitarian regime, while the company has been attacking the European Union and DMA almost non-stop for months now. It really shows where Apple&#8217;s priorities lie. Meanwhile, Facebook&#8217;s pay-for-privacy model was always going to be a hard sell at ‚Ç¨10 a month, and as such, the company already announced it was going to cut that cost in half. Google&#8217;s plans are a bit more nebulous, since it&#8217;s a bit more difficult to see tangible results from things like search rankings, but it seems here, too, the European Commission has its worries about compliance. The European Commission intends to complete its investigations within a year, and if found in violation of the law, companies can be fined for up to 10% of their worldwide turnover, which can grow up to 20% for repeated infringements.

## Floorp Firefox fork makes its modifications closed source due to forks

date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News

Update: a short notice on the blog post now reads that &#8220;Floorp‚Äôs code is now fully public again.&#8221; It seems the developer has reversed course, which is good news. The original article continues below. Recently, a few people suggested I give the browser Floorp a try, a Firefox fork with some additional UI changes and additions. Since it was based on Firefox ESR, however, I saw no point in even trying it, because I prefer to be on the latest Firefox release. It seems I accidentally made the right choice, since yesterday the developers behind Floorp decided to take their modifications closed source. The appearance of Floorp forks &#8211; which, may I remind you, is a fork itself &#8211; seems to be the cause. I know it‚Äôs not nice of me to say, but Floorp has been in too much demand. It am surprise to me that companies and organizations would fork a fork that I had created when I was still a teenager, and at first I was happy about it, but it was not beneficial to me, and on the contrary, it was mentally draining. There were forks that wanted to hide the fact that they were Floorp forks, forks that did not want to contribute to Floorp at all, forks that used the code for life and just changed the name of Floorp, and many other forks were born. ‚Ü´ Floorp blog It seems the developer of Floorp is rather young, and started the project as a teenager, and as such, I don&#8217;t think we should be too harsh on them &#8211; I did some dumb things as a teenager &#8211; but complaining about forks of your own fork seems a bit disingenuous, regardless of how young and inexperienced you are. I understand seeing your work forked into competing browsers can be frustrating, but it&#8217;s a core part of the open source world, especially if you yourself owe your product to forking, too.

## Sources: iOS 18 lets users customize layout of home screen app icons

date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News

While app icons will likely remain locked to an invisible grid system on the Home Screen, to ensure there is some uniformity, our sources say that users will be able to arrange icons more freely on iOS 18. For example, we expect that the update will introduce the ability to create blank spaces, rows, and columns between app icons. ‚Ü´ Joe Rossignol at MacRumors It&#8217;s 2024 and iOS&#8217; Springboard is slowly catching up to the Palm OS launcher. I&#8217;m drowning in the innovation here.

## Episode 128 - Cryotrons LIVE!

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Originally presented at VCF SoCal in February of 2024.</p> <p>The cryotron, a superconductive switch, almost revolutionized computing. It's one of those fascinating near misses. In this episode we are talking about the history of the cryotron, how the NSA and supercomputing factors into the mix, and the current state of research into the topic. Did the NSA actually construct a supercomputer that ran in a vat of liquid helium?

Learning how to make stuff look good in a tiny little format like that. I don't mind having a small space to deploy in, but I like to have lots of room where I write. Linkblogs and blogrolls go together really well. Blogrolls work best for smaller groups of people and projects, not the huge number of followers people have on the twitter-like social web. But I think even a few hundred items in a blogroll work, as long as it's dynamic, and it's reverse chronologic.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Never thought I'd be so glad to see the <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">xml-rpc site</a> back up and running. I found out about it being off by someone sending an email asking if they could buy the domain from me. Otherwise I'm not sure I would have noticed. The whole idea is to put these static sites in a safe place and forget about it. But clearly there are no safe places and someday you might get dragged back to try to debug some work you did a bunch of years ago.

So I went ahead and moved <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">xmlrpc.com</a> to a HTTPS server. The <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/22/031933.html">other day</a> I forgot to mention that style sheets might not be readable when you move from HTTP to HTTPS, leading to <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/24/httpsBreaksSitesThanksGoogle.png">this striking breakage</a> I saw when I first got to look at the site in its new location. And now thanks to Google and the EFF, I get to spend time debugging something that worked just fine in 1998 and every year since then. Should I send them the bill for my time? Fuckers.

## Hyprland crash course

date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News

For the past week I have been configuring hyprland and using it as my daily driver. Coming from major Desktop Environments like KDE or Gnome, this was definitely quite challanging, specially when implementing features that we take it for granted on these DEs, like screen sharing or screenshot annotating. In this post I will be going through all the tools and scripts I have been creating to configure this amazing Window Manager to my liking. ‚Ü´ xd1.dev Like I mentioned in my MNT Reform review, I&#8217;m not a fan of these &#8220;build your own desktop environment&#8221; window managers and related tools, but there&#8217;s no denying they&#8217;re quite popular. This article is a good introduction to hyprland, one of the more popular window managers of this genre.

## The Mind Khadas: a modular PC

date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News

I saw this on a Linus Tech Tips video today, and it&#8217;s pretty neat: the Khadas Mind is a tiny computer powered by an Intel Core i5-1340P or Core i7-1360P, but it has a souped-up PCIe connector at the bottom that allows you to hook it up to all kinds of other devices, like a graphics card, a dock, and so on. It looks slick and quite user-friendly, and according to the LTT video, the company intends to release the specs for the connector so that third parties can hook into it as well, but a promise is just that &#8211; a promise. It&#8217;s way too early to tell if this will go anywhere &#8211; past attempts would suggest that sadly, it won&#8217;t &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not an incredibly awesome and seemingly workable implementation of the modular PC idea.

## Newsboat 2.35 is out

date: 2024-03-24, updated: 2024-03-24, from: Newsboat News


            <p>
                Another quarter, another Newsboat release!
            </p>

            <p>
		The highlight for this one is Feedbin support. Feedbin is an
		online newsreading service in the vein of Google Reader, and we
		already support a bunch of similar ones. The feature request
                for Feedbin specifically was filed 4 years ago, and upvoted
		19¬†times¬†‚Äî twice more often than the runner-up, a request for
		separators between groups of feeds. We‚Äòve been waiting for an
		interested person to tackle this, and finally James Vaughan
                showed up with a complete implementation. Please give it a spin
		if you‚Äòve been waiting for this functionality all these years,
                and thanks for your patience!
            </p>

            <p>
		Another notable feature is support for item starring with
		Miniflux. This was on the to-do list for a while too, and was
		implemented by gilcu3. Interestingly, both of these are first
		ever contributions; it‚Äòs very nice to see new faces in
                Newsboat‚Äòs pull requests!
            </p>

            <p>
		There‚Äòs also a few new scripts in the contrib directory, and
		loads of internal reworking by Dennis van der Schagt and others.
		Probably some new bugs too, but Juho Eerola fixed one in 2.35,
                so let‚Äòs call it even, ok?
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, enough chatter; go grab the source:

## Digital wallets and the ‚Äúonly Apple Pay does this‚Äù mythology

date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News

I hope what you take away from this post is that while Apple Pay is a great way to pay for things and that Apple did a great job mainstreaming digital wallets like this, what they do is not unique in the industry. DPANs are great for making it harder to track one person‚Äôs purchases across multiple merchants and they make customers less at risk in the event of a data breach of payment card info. ‚Ü´ Matt Birchler The gist of the article is that all the things Apple claims are unique about Apple Pay are really not unique at all, and quite a few things Apple touts are just flat-out lies, such as merchants being unable to know what you buy or people being unable to track you when you use Apple Pay. Other digital wallets, from Google, Samsung, and others, work in the exact same way Apple Pay does, and even banks and similar companies implement their payment systems the way Apple Pay does. It&#8217;s a case study in how Apple&#8217;s marketing and PR bloggers manage to perpetuate a myth solely because so many people just assume it must be true. Apple wouldn&#8217;t lie, right?

<p>I have followed the Palestinian struggle since about 2000 and read every book I could on the subject.</p><p>But TikTok has really made this knowledge accessible to the public.  The TikTokers know how to explain in small bursts like nothing I have seen before. </p><p>Accurate and concise.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/299">Braintrust query</a>: I have not been able to reliably get to a bunch of my sites that use HTTP this morning. For example, <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://techfightclub.wordpress.com/feed/">feeder.scripting.com</a>, a site that I use to test feeds. Also <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">xmlrpc.com</a>. It's possible that something broke overnight in my server. Or Digital Ocean is having a problem? Doesn't seem like it's something Google is doing to punish me for using HTTP, though that is always the first thing that comes to mind. I tried moving the XML-RPC site to a different server, but the problem follows it. No changes have been made to the site in years. Not exactly what I had planned to be digging into on a nice (but cold) Sunday morning in the mountains. I started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/299">thread</a>, if you have any insights. At least scripting.com is still working, but it's not served through my software or Digital Ocean.

## Another day, another paean of praise for the Amiga's 1980s pre-emptive multitasking GUI

date: 2024-03-24, from: Liam on Linux

<div>Yes, the Amiga offered a GUI with pre-emptive multitasking, as early as 1985 or so. And it was affordable: you didn't even need a hard disk.<br /><span class="commtext c00"><p>The thing is, that's only part of the story.</p><p>There's  a generation of techies who are about 40 now who don't remember this  stuff well, and some of the older ones have forgotten with time but  don't realise. I had some greybeard angrily telling me that floppy  drives were IDE recently. Senile idiot.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>Preemptive multitasking is only part of the story. Lots of systems had it. Windows <i>2.0</i> could do preemptive multitasking -- but only of DOS apps, and only in the base 640kB of RAM, so it was pretty useless.</p><p>It  sounds good but it's not. Because the other key ingredient is memory  protection. You need both, together, to have a compelling deal. Amiga  and Windows 2.x/3.x only had the preemption part, they had no hardware  memory management or protection to go with it. (Windows 3.x <i>when running on a 386</i> and also <i>when given &gt;2MB RAM</i> could do some, for DOS apps, but not much.)</p><p>Having  multiple pre-emptive tasks is relatively easy if they are all in the  same memory space, but it's horribly horribly unstable.</p><p>Also see:  microkernels. In size terms, AmigaOS was a microkernel, but a  microkernel without memory protection is not such a big deal, because  the hard part of a microkernel is the interprocess communication, and if  they can just do that by reading and writing each other's RAM it's  trivially easy but also trivially insecure and trivially unstable.</p><p>RISC  OS had pre-emptive multitasking too... but only of text-only  command-line windows, and there were few CLI RISC OS apps so it was  mostly useless. At least on 16-bit Windows there were lots of DOS apps  so it was vaguely useful, if they'd fit into memory. Which only trivial  ones would. Windows 3 came along very late in the DOS era, and by then,  most DOS apps didn't fit into memory <i>on their own</i> one at a time. I  made good money optimising DOS memory around 1990-1992 because I was  very good at it and without it most DOS apps didn't fit into 500-550kB  any more. So two of them in 640kB? Forget it.</p><p>Preemption is clever. It lets apps that weren't designed to multitask do it.</p><p>But it's also <i>slow</i>. Which is <i>why</i>  RISC OS didn't do it. Co-op is much quicker  which is also why OSes like RISC OS and 16-bit Windows chose it for  their GUI apps: because GUI apps strained the resources of  late-1980s/very-early-1990s computers. So you had 2 choices:</p><p>&bull; The Mac and GEM way: don't multitask at all.</p><p>&bull; The 16-bit Windows and RISC OS way: multitask cooperatively, and hope nothing goes wrong.</p><p>Later,  notably, MacOS 7-8-9 and Falcon MultiTOS/MiNT/MagiC etc added coop  multitasking to single-tasking GUI OSes. I used MacOS 8.x and 9.x <i>a lot</i> and I really liked them. They were extraordinarily usable to an extent Mac OS X has never and will never catch up with.</p><p>But  the good thing about owning a Mac in the 1990s was that at least one  thing in your life was guaranteed to go down on you every single day.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></span></div><div>(Repurposed from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39806580">a HN comment</a>.)<br />&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=90834" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments
