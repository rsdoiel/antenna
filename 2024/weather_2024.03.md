Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 PM CST Mon Jan 15 2024

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are not forecast through tonight.

...20Z Update...
No appreciable changes have been made to the prior forecast.

..Gleason.. 01/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1016 AM CST Mon Jan 15 2024/

...Central FL this afternoon...
Cyclonic flow aloft will persist over the CONUS from the Rockies
eastward, with ridging over the Pacific coast.  One embedded speed
maxima will progress east-northeastward from the Mid-South to the
Mid-Atlantic, in advance of an upstream wave moving from the central
High Plains/Rockies to the mid MS/lower OH Valleys.  The majority of
the CONUS will be relatively cold/dry, with the only buoyant warm
sector confined to the FL peninsula (and just off the southeast
Atlantic coast tonight).  The ongoing convection between Fort Meyers
and Sarasota could persist through the afternoon while spreading
east-northeastward along the warm front.  There will be sufficient
vertical shear/hodograph length for a weakly rotating storm within
the cluster, but poor midlevel lapse rates and modest low-level
flow/shear suggest that severe storms are unlikely.

Mesoscale Discussion 0069
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 AM CST Mon Jan 15 2024

Areas affected...parts of middle and eastern Tennessee

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 151750Z - 152045Z

SUMMARY...An area of heavier snow rates, occasionally approaching 1
inch per hour, may be maintained east-northeastward across portions
of middle and eastern Tennessee through 2-4 PM CST, before gradually
diminishing through early evening.

DISCUSSION...A mid-level speed maximum propagating across northern
Mississippi is forecast to reach the Cumberland Plateau by early
evening.  This  still appears associated with an area of enhanced
mid/upper forcing for ascent, which might be maintained through the
20-22Z time frame while overspreading portions of middle through
eastern Tennessee.  Thereafter, frontogenetic forcing is forecast to
generally weaken across the Tennessee Valley through southern
Appalachians vicinity, yielding diminishing precipitation rates. 
Until then, it appears that the area of enhanced lift will include
upward vertical motion maximized within the favorably cold mid-level
layer (centered around or above 600 mb) for large dendritic ice
crystal growth.  It appears this may remain strong enough to support
continuing potential for occasional heavy snow rates up to around 1
inch per hour, where lower/mid tropospheric profiles are maintained
at or below freezing (roughly north of the 0 C isotherm at 859 mb).

Mesoscale Discussion 0068
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1117 AM CST Mon Jan 15 2024

Areas affected...Louisiana into Mississippi and northern Alabama

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 151717Z - 152115Z

SUMMARY...A wintry mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain is expected
to spread east from southeast Arkansas and northern Louisiana into
Mississippi and northern Alabama through early afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Surface observations, LSRs, and MPING reports over the
past 1-2 hours continue to show a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing
rain from the ArkLaTex region into northern MS/AL within a broad
precipitation swath. Isentropic ascent over a 925-850 mb frontal
zone is forecast to persist through early afternoon as a
low-amplitude wave, currently over the southern Plains, migrates
east. Recent sleet LSRs and forecast soundings suggest that a mix of
snow and sleet will be more likely where surface temperatures are in
the low 20s or lower. Areas where temperatures are in the mid-20s or
higher should have too shallow/warm of a sub-freezing layer to
support much re-freezing of hydrometeors, making a sleet/freezing
rain mix more probable. Forecast guidance suggests that
precipitation intensity may gradually wane heading into the
mid-afternoon hours, but a zone of impactful wintry precipitation
appears probable prior to this occurring.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1129 AM CST Mon Jan 15 2024

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear unlikely on Tuesday.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A large upper cyclone will encompass much of the central/eastern
CONUS and Canada on Tuesday. Thunderstorm potential will remain
limited to locations along/south of a front forecast to be in place
over the FL Peninsula, where greater low-level moisture will reside.
As the upper trough progresses eastward through the day, a weak
surface reflection should develop from the northeastern Gulf of
Mexico to the coastal western Atlantic. The cold front should also
move southeastward across the FL Peninsula through the period.

Strong (50-60 kt) mid-level west-southwesterly flow associated with
the upper cyclone will be present over much of FL. Similar values of
deep-layer shear would typically support organized severe
thunderstorm potential. However, in this case forecast thermodynamic
profiles across central/south FL will likely hinder updraft
intensity, as poor mid-level lapse rates and warm temperatures aloft
limit the degree of instability that can develop. In addition,
enhanced low/mid-level flow will be largely parallel to the surface
front, limiting low-level convergence/ascent. While there may be
some potential for strong/gusty winds with any convection that
develops and can remain south of the front, the undercutting nature
of the boundary suggests that overall severe potential will probably
remain too low/sparse for highlights.

Mesoscale Discussion 0063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CST Sun Jan 14 2024

Areas affected...Southeast New York into the New England region

Concerning...Snow Squall 

Valid 141649Z - 142045Z

SUMMARY...Thermodynamic conditions will remain favorable for snow
squalls as a cold front pushes east into the New England region.

DISCUSSION...Recent regional radar depicts broken bands of shallow
convection along an eastward moving cold front from upstate NY into
eastern PA. Visibility reductions between 1/4 to 1 mile have been
observed with the passage of these bands and are primarily being
driven by bursts of moderate to heavy snow with 25-35 mph wind
gusts. The 12 UTC PIT sounding likely sampled the convective
environment most accurately with nearly dry adiabatic lapse rates
from the surface to ~750 mb, which appears to be represented well by
recent 0-3 km lapse rate analyses. The plume of 8+ C/km low-level
lapse rates is forecast to spread to the northeast into the New
England region through the day in tandem with the cooler mid-level
temperatures associated with the primary trough axis. Low-level
instability should be bolstered by modest diurnal heating between
cloud breaks through the afternoon, and a weak influx of moisture
may support occasional lightning flashes, though sustained,
lightning-producing convection is not necessarily anticipated.
Nonetheless, the combination of improving low-level thermodynamics,
focused ascent along the front, and 30-40 mph winds within the
boundary layer should maintain the snow squall potential well into
the afternoon.
