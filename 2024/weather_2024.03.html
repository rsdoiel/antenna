Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0619 PM CST Wed Jan 17 2024

Valid 180100Z - 181200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms remain unlikely tonight.

...01z Update...

Stable conditions exist across the CONUS this evening with offshore
flow now dominant across the FL Peninsula. Any meaningful buoyancy
has been shunted south of the FL Straits, thus the prospect for
lightning is very low tonight.

Mesoscale Discussion 0078
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CST Wed Jan 17 2024

Areas affected...Washington...northeast Oregon...northern
Idaho...and western Montana

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 171949Z - 172345Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snowfall rates between 1-2 inches per hour are
probable - especially at higher elevations - through the afternoon
and early evening.

DISCUSSION...Surface observations over the past hour have reported
an uptick in snowfall intensity across portions of OR and northern
ID. This comes as a swath of precipitation becomes more widespread
ahead of a compact, progressive upper disturbance moving into the
Pacific Northwest. Lift will likely be focused/maximized along a
mid-level baroclinic zone between 850-700 mb, which should overlap
to some degree with a DGZ between 700-600 mb (based on recent
forecast soundings). The combination of more focused ascent within a
portion of the DGZ should support moderate to heavy snowfall rates
up to 1 inch/hour. More localized orographic ascent will likely
enhance snowfall rates within the higher elevations, and could
support snowfall rates up to (and possibly exceeding) 2 inches/hour.
A minimum in snowfall rates is anticipated across central WA where
orographic ascent contribution will be considerably smaller.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CST Wed Jan 17 2024

Valid 191200Z - 251200Z

Upper ridging will build into the central CONUS through the weekend,
with a stationary upper trough moving in and settling over the
southern Plains through the middle of next week. Initially, surface
high pressure and colder air beneath the upper ridge will remain in
place across the central and eastern United Stated into early next
week. Thereafter, the anticipated persistent mid-level troughing in
the southern Plains will encourage low-level moisture return for
multiple days across the south-central into the southeastern U.S.
Through the extended forecast period, the combination of cool or
moist surface conditions and poorly receptive fuels will limit
wildfire-spread potential.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 PM CST Wed Jan 17 2024

Valid 172000Z - 181200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected in the conterminous U.S. through
tonight.

Thunderstorms remain unlikely across the CONUS today, with cool
and/or stable air over land. Sporadic weak convection may produce a
few lightning flashes from the FL Straits into the Bahamas, aided by
warm water temperature beneath a midlevel moist plume.

..Jewell.. 01/17/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0951 AM CST Wed Jan 17 2024/

...Synopsis...
The majority of the CONUS is dominated by a continental polar air
mass, with the associated front now into the Bahamas/Cuba/northern
Yucatan.  Substantial low-level moisture and buoyancy are likely to
remain to the south of FL, and little to no buoyancy is expected
with the shortwave trough over the Great Basin/central Rockies. 
Thus, thunderstorms are not expected through Thursday morning.

forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 01/17/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1150 PM CST Tue Jan 16 2024/

...Synopsis...
A belt of strong deep-layer west-northwesterly flow will persist
across the central/southern Rockies on D2/Thursday, favoring lee
troughing over the adjacent High Plains. Along/south of the lee
trough, a modest pressure gradient and boundary-layer mixing into
the strong flow aloft will yield two corridors of strong/gusty
surface winds. The northern corridor will extend from east-central
NM into the western portion of the TX South Plains, though RH
reductions will be marginal here (i.e., 20-25 percent). Farther
south, a second belt of sustained westerly surface winds near 20 mph
(with higher gusts) is expected across the TX Trans-Pecos region.
Here, warmer surface temperatures will support 15-20 percent RH, and
with slightly more receptive fuels, locally elevated fire-weather
conditions are possible. With that said, the overall threat appears
too localized for Elevated highlights given modestly receptive fuels
at best.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1149 PM CST Tue Jan 16 2024/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough accompanied by strong westerly flow
aloft will impinge on the central Rockies during the day, promoting
a deepening lee cyclone over the central High Plains. Along and
south of this feature, 15-25 mph sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds (with higher gusts) will develop across much of the
southern High Plains during the afternoon. Here, strengthening
downslope flow will contribute to 15-25 percent minimum RH, though
RH reductions should be marginal where the strongest surface winds
are expected (i.e., east-central NM into the western TX Panhandle
and in the immediate lee of the high terrain in eastern NM). While
locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible across the
region, the limited wind/RH overlap and marginal fuels preclude
Elevated highlights.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected in the conterminous U.S. through
tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, broadly cyclonic mean flow will be maintained
over most of the CONUS, downstream from a synoptic ridge that will
move over the Pacific Coast around the end of the period.  A cyclone
that moved ashore during the prior overnight period has devolved to
an open shortwave trough over OR.  This feature should deamplify
gradually as it rapidly crosses the northern Great Basin to central
Rockies today, reaching MO and OK by 12Z tomorrow.  Though a flash
or two cannot be ruled out as the associated midlevel cooling/
moisture cross the Intermountain West today, lightning potential
appears too isolated, brief and unfocused to warrant an outlook
area.

Otherwise, troughing over the East will deamplify somewhat today as
a strong shortwave exits the East Coast.  A related/preceding
surface cold front -- initially analyzed from the northern Bahamas
across the eastern/southern Straits of FL -- will decelerate,
weaken, and remain south of FL through the period.  Lightning
potential over land appears minimal at best, and too low for a 10%
areal outline.  Elsewhere, the air mass will be too dry and/or
stable for thunder over the CONUS.

On Wednesday, a stable pattern will exist across the CONUS,
primarily due to high pressure centered over the Southeast. A large

with offshore surface winds across the Gulf of Mexico and western
Atlantic. Meanwhile, a broad region of cyclonic flow aloft will
extend westward across the Plains and Rockies, with an upper ridge
along the West Coast. As such, thunderstorms are not forecast due to
a lack of instability across the entire CONUS.

Mesoscale Discussion 0073
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CST Tue Jan 16 2024

Areas affected...Parts of the Mid Atlantic into southern New England

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 161349Z - 161745Z

SUMMARY...Locally moderate winter precipitation rates will spread
northeastward this morning, with some modest ice accretion possible
where freezing rain persists.

DISCUSSION...A surface low currently off of the Mid Atlantic coast
is forecast to gradually deepen as it moves northeast toward coastal
southern New England this morning. Multiple waves of light to
locally moderate precipitation are ongoing and will continue to
spread northeastward in conjunction with the surface low. While
interior portions of the Northeast will likely continue to see snow
(with generally light to moderate rates) this morning, low-level
warm advection will support a transition from snow to sleet across
parts of southern New England, with freezing rain persisting over
portions of the Mid Atlantic region.

As the low deepens offshore, a modest uptick in precipitation
intensity will be possible through the morning. While rates will
likely remain light to locally moderate, antecedent cold conditions
(with temperatures initially in the 20s F) may result in relatively
efficient ice accretion in areas that transition to freezing rain.
Pockets of moderate sleet/snow will also be possible into parts of
southern New England. Low-level warm advection will support a
gradual transition to rain along the Mid Atlantic and southern New
England coasts, but subfreezing temperatures may persist inland
through the morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0074
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1017 AM CST Tue Jan 16 2024

Areas affected...Central Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 161617Z - 161815Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A line of storms moving onto the Florida west coast within
the next hour may pose a risk of damaging winds. Watch issuance is
not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...A band of convection focused along a cold front is
slowly approaching the FL west coast per recent radar/satellite
imagery. GOES IR and lightning trends show a few intensifying
updrafts within the line, denoted by concentrated lightning clusters
and cooling cloud top temperatures. This trend should continue as
the line moves onshore where temperatures are warming into the
low/mid 70s and MLCAPE values are slowly increasing to 1000-1500
J/kg. VWP observations from KTBW show 0-6 km BWD values around 50-60
knots, but deep-layer shear vectors are largely oriented along the
boundary with weak line-normal deep-layer shear. This may limit the
overall organization/intensity of the line, but may support stronger
embedded segments capable of damaging winds. This kinematic regime
is not overly favorable for line-embedded tornadoes, but a brief
tornado appears possible if a portion of the line can become more
oriented from southeast to northwest. Confidence in this scenario is
low at this time given recent storm trends, and a damaging wind risk
appears more probable. Regardless, the overall severe threat appears
too limited to warrant watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 0069
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 AM CST Mon Jan 15 2024

Areas affected...parts of middle and eastern Tennessee

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 151750Z - 152045Z

SUMMARY...An area of heavier snow rates, occasionally approaching 1
inch per hour, may be maintained east-northeastward across portions
of middle and eastern Tennessee through 2-4 PM CST, before gradually
diminishing through early evening.

DISCUSSION...A mid-level speed maximum propagating across northern
Mississippi is forecast to reach the Cumberland Plateau by early
evening.  This  still appears associated with an area of enhanced
mid/upper forcing for ascent, which might be maintained through the
20-22Z time frame while overspreading portions of middle through
eastern Tennessee.  Thereafter, frontogenetic forcing is forecast to
generally weaken across the Tennessee Valley through southern
Appalachians vicinity, yielding diminishing precipitation rates. 
Until then, it appears that the area of enhanced lift will include
upward vertical motion maximized within the favorably cold mid-level
layer (centered around or above 600 mb) for large dendritic ice
crystal growth.  It appears this may remain strong enough to support
continuing potential for occasional heavy snow rates up to around 1
inch per hour, where lower/mid tropospheric profiles are maintained
at or below freezing (roughly north of the 0 C isotherm at 859 mb).

Mesoscale Discussion 0068
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1117 AM CST Mon Jan 15 2024

Areas affected...Louisiana into Mississippi and northern Alabama

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 151717Z - 152115Z

SUMMARY...A wintry mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain is expected
to spread east from southeast Arkansas and northern Louisiana into
Mississippi and northern Alabama through early afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Surface observations, LSRs, and MPING reports over the
past 1-2 hours continue to show a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing
rain from the ArkLaTex region into northern MS/AL within a broad
precipitation swath. Isentropic ascent over a 925-850 mb frontal
zone is forecast to persist through early afternoon as a
low-amplitude wave, currently over the southern Plains, migrates
east. Recent sleet LSRs and forecast soundings suggest that a mix of
snow and sleet will be more likely where surface temperatures are in
the low 20s or lower. Areas where temperatures are in the mid-20s or
higher should have too shallow/warm of a sub-freezing layer to
support much re-freezing of hydrometeors, making a sleet/freezing
rain mix more probable. Forecast guidance suggests that
precipitation intensity may gradually wane heading into the
mid-afternoon hours, but a zone of impactful wintry precipitation
appears probable prior to this occurring.

Mesoscale Discussion 0063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CST Sun Jan 14 2024

Areas affected...Southeast New York into the New England region

Concerning...Snow Squall 

Valid 141649Z - 142045Z

SUMMARY...Thermodynamic conditions will remain favorable for snow
squalls as a cold front pushes east into the New England region.

DISCUSSION...Recent regional radar depicts broken bands of shallow
convection along an eastward moving cold front from upstate NY into
eastern PA. Visibility reductions between 1/4 to 1 mile have been
observed with the passage of these bands and are primarily being
driven by bursts of moderate to heavy snow with 25-35 mph wind
gusts. The 12 UTC PIT sounding likely sampled the convective
environment most accurately with nearly dry adiabatic lapse rates
from the surface to ~750 mb, which appears to be represented well by
recent 0-3 km lapse rate analyses. The plume of 8+ C/km low-level
lapse rates is forecast to spread to the northeast into the New
England region through the day in tandem with the cooler mid-level
temperatures associated with the primary trough axis. Low-level
instability should be bolstered by modest diurnal heating between
cloud breaks through the afternoon, and a weak influx of moisture
may support occasional lightning flashes, though sustained,
lightning-producing convection is not necessarily anticipated.
Nonetheless, the combination of improving low-level thermodynamics,
focused ascent along the front, and 30-40 mph winds within the
boundary layer should maintain the snow squall potential well into
the afternoon.
