## Transmission risk evaluation of transfusion blood containing low-density Babesia microti

date: 2024-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Babesia</italic> is a unique apicomplexan parasite that specifically invades and proliferates in red blood cells and can be transmitted via blood transfusion, resulting in transfusion-transmitted babesiosis. However, detecting <italic>Babesia</italic> in blood before transfusion has not received enough attention, and the risk of transfusing blood containing a low density of <italic>Babesia microti</italic> (<italic>B. microti</italic>) is unclear, possibly threatening public health and wellness.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>This study aimed to determine the lower detection limit of <italic>B. microti</italic> in blood and to evaluate the transmission risk of blood transfusion containing low-density <italic>B. microti</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Infected BALB/c mouse models were established by transfusing infected whole blood with different infection rates and densities of <italic>B. microti</italic>. Microscopic examination, nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (nested PCR), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to evaluate the infection status of the mouse models. Meanwhile, the nested PCR detection limit of <italic>B. microti</italic> was obtained using pure <italic>B. microti</italic> DNA samples with serial concentrations and whole blood samples with different densities of <italic>B. microti</italic>-infected red blood cells. Thereafter, whole mouse blood with a <italic>B. microti</italic> density lower than that of the nested PCR detection limit and human blood samples infected with <italic>B. microti</italic> were transfused into healthy mice to assess the transmission risk in mouse models. The infection status of these mice was evaluated through microscopic examination, nested PCR tests, and ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mice inoculated with different densities of <italic>B. microti</italic> reached the peak infection rate on different days. Overall, the higher the blood <italic>B. microti</italic> density was, the earlier the peak infection rate was reached. The levels of specific antibodies against <italic>B. microti</italic> in the blood of the infected mice increased sharply during the first 30 days of infection, reaching a peak level at 60 days post-infection, and maintaining a high level thereafter. The nested PCR detection limits of <italic>B. microti</italic> DNA and parasite density were 3 fg and 5.48 parasites/μL, respectively. The whole blood containing an extremely low density of <italic>B. microti</italic> and human blood samples infected with <italic>B. microti</italic> could infect mice, confirming the transmission risk of transfusing blood with low-density <italic>B. microti</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Whole blood containing extremely low density of <italic>B. microti</italic> poses a high transmission risk when transfused between mice and mice or human and mice, suggesting that <italic>Babesia</italic> detection should be considered by governments, hospitals, and disease prevention and control centers as a mandatory test before blood donation or transfusion.</p></sec>

## Avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) review by continent

date: 2024-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus responsible for substantial economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide by causing a highly contagious respiratory disease. The virus can spread quickly through contact, contaminated equipment, aerosols, and personal-to-person contact. We highlight the prevalence and geographic distribution of all nine genotypes, as well as the relevant symptoms and economic impact, by extensively analyzing the current literature. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis was performed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA-6), which provided insights into the global molecular diversity and evolution of IBV strains. This review highlights that IBV genotype I (GI) is prevalent worldwide because sporadic cases have been found on many continents. Conversely, GII was identified as a European strain that subsequently dispersed throughout Europe and South America. GIII and GV are predominant in Australia, with very few reports from Asia. GIV, GVIII, and GIX originate from North America. GIV was found to circulate in Asia, and GVII was identified in Europe and China. Geographically, the GVI-1 lineage is thought to be restricted to Asia. This review highlights that IBV still often arises in commercial chicken flocks despite immunization and biosecurity measures because of the ongoing introduction of novel IBV variants and inadequate cross-protection provided by the presently available vaccines. Consequently, IB consistently jeopardizes the ability of the poultry industry to grow and prosper. Identifying these domains will aid in discerning the pathogenicity and prevalence of IBV genotypes, potentially enhancing disease prevention and management tactics.</p>

## Antiviral responses versus virus-induced cellular shutoff: a game of thrones between influenza A virus NS1 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1

date: 2024-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Following virus recognition of host cell receptors and viral particle/genome internalization, viruses replicate in the host via hijacking essential host cell machinery components to evade the provoked antiviral innate immunity against the invading pathogen. Respiratory viral infections are usually acute with the ability to activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in/on host cells, resulting in the production and release of interferons (IFNs), proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to reduce virus fitness and mitigate infection. Nevertheless, the game between viruses and the host is a complicated and dynamic process, in which they restrict each other via specific factors to maintain their own advantages and win this game. The primary role of the non-structural protein 1 (NS1 and Nsp1) of influenza A viruses (IAV) and the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respectively, is to control antiviral host-induced innate immune responses. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the genesis, spatial structure, viral and cellular interactors, and the mechanisms underlying the unique biological functions of IAV NS1 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 in infected host cells. We also highlight the role of both non-structural proteins in modulating viral replication and pathogenicity. Eventually, and because of their important role during viral infection, we also describe their promising potential as targets for antiviral therapy and the development of live attenuated vaccines (LAV). Conclusively, both IAV NS1 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 play an important role in virus–host interactions, viral replication, and pathogenesis, and pave the way to develop novel prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions for the treatment of these important human respiratory viral pathogens.</p>

## Unraveling the mystery: a Mendelian randomized exploration of gut microbiota and different types of obesity

date: 2024-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the influence of gut microbiota on the development of obesity. In this study, we utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the gut microbiota characteristics among different types of obese patients, aiming to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and provide novel insights for obesity treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to assess causal relationships between gut microbiota and various obesity subtypes. Gut microbiota data were obtained from the international consortium MiBioGen, and data on obese individuals were sourced from the Finnish National Biobank FinnGen. Eligible single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables. Various analytical methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, MR-RAPS, and Lasso regression, were applied. Sensitivity analyses for quality control included MR-Egger intercept tests, Cochran’s Q tests, and leave-one-out analyses and others.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mendelian randomization studies revealed distinct gut microbiota profiles among European populations with different obesity subtypes. Following multivariable MR analysis, we found that <italic>Ruminococcaceae UCG010</italic> [<italic>Odds Ratio (OR)</italic>: 0.842, <italic>95% confidence interval (CI)</italic>: 0.766-0.926, Adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: 0.028] independently reduced the risk of obesity induced by excessive calorie intake, while <italic>Butyricimonas</italic> [<italic>OR</italic>: 4.252, <italic>95% CI</italic>: 2.177-8.307, Adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: 0.002] independently increased the risk of medication-induced obesity. For localized adiposity, <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic> [<italic>OR</italic>: 0.213, <italic>95% CI</italic>: 0.115-0.395, Adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: &lt;0.001] acted as a protective factor. In the case of extreme obesity with alveolar hypoventilation, <italic>lactobacillus</italic> [<italic>OR</italic>: 0.724, <italic>95% CI</italic>: 0.609-0.860, Adjusted <italic>P</italic> value: 0.035] reduced the risk of its occurrence. Additionally, six gut microbiota may have potential roles in the onset of different types of obesity. Specifically, the <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> torques group may increase the risk of its occurrence. <italic>Desulfovibrio</italic> and <italic>Catenabacterium</italic> may serve as protective factors in the onset of Drug-induced obesity. <italic>Oxalobacteraceae</italic>, <italic>Actinomycetaceae</italic>, and <italic>Ruminiclostridium 9</italic>, on the other hand, could potentially increase the risk of Drug-induced obesity. No evidence of heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy among SNPs was found in the above studies (all <italic>P</italic> values for Q test and MR-Egger intercept &gt; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Gut microbiota abundance is causally related to obesity, with distinct gut microbiota profiles observed among different obesity subtypes. Four bacterial species, including <italic>Ruminococcaceae UCG010</italic>, <italic>Butyricimonas</italic>, <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic> and <italic>lactobacillus</italic> independently influence the development of various types of obesity. Probiotic and prebiotic supplementation may represent a novel approach in future obesity management.</p></sec>
