## LLM Prompt Injection Worm

date: 2024-03-04, updated: 2024-03-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Researchers have <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/compromptmized">demonstrated</a> a worm that spreads through prompt injection. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/here-come-the-ai-worms/">Details</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email including the adversarial text prompt, which &#8220;poisons&#8221; the database of an email assistant using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a>, a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it &#8220;jailbreaks the GenAI service&#8221; and ultimately steals data from the emails, Nassi says. &#8220;The generated response containing the sensitive user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,&#8221; Nassi says...</p></blockquote>
