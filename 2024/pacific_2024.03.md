## OPINION ǀ Truth 3: A MLK Day Reality Check Special — A Day On, not a Day Off & Kudos Joeten

date: 2024-01-14, updated: 2024-01-14, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH is Dr. King was REAL and what he did was historical as he not only changed America but he even changed most of the world and today is “a day on, not a day off” to promote his dream of “racial equality for all people of color.”  The reality is the CNMI would look &amp; be very different had it not been for Dr. King — for TRUE, believe it or not! The Civil Rights Movement was not just about Blacks but about ALL the People of color, which included the local population of Chamorros &amp; Carolinians who would have gone to Black schools with me back-in-the-day and called the “N-word” just like I was called.  MLK Day is not just for Black folks and it is my sincere hopes and prayers that ONE Day that THIS-DAY will truly be celebrated island-wide on the beaches or wherever people can gather in celebration because the Civil Rights Movement was for all people of color, especially the local people who benefited from the end-results of the movement which was the 1964, Civil Rights Act.
