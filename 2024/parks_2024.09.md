<p>The cutthroat trout is Montana’s state fish. One of two subspecies, the westslope cutthroat trout is the primary sub species found in the upper Missouri River Basin of southwest Montana. Once the dominate species in the streams and rivers of southwest Montana, this species now occupies approximately five percent of its historic range due to competition and hybridization from non-native species.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s the westslope cutthroat trout was petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) found that listing under the ESA was not warranted in 2003. Despite this finding, it highlighted the significant threats to the species.</p>

<p>Shortly after the USFWS determined listing was not warranted, a statewide working group was formed centered around the conservation of the westslope cutthroat trout. Ultimately a Memorandum (MOU) of Understanding for westslope conservation was developed that included federal and state government agencies, non-government conservation groups, private industry, and livestock organizations from around the state. In total, 28 agencies/groups including the BLM were signatories on the MOU. This MOU laid the foundation for cross boundary coordination and restorative work on westslope cutthroat trout habitat, and some of the biggest gains for the species have occurred in southwest Montana.</p>

<p>Since 2010, more than 30 large cutthroat projects have occurred and over 300 miles of cutthroat trout habitat has been protected on federal, state, and private lands throughout southwest Montana. Projects include habitat restoration, construction of fish barriers to protect at risk fish populations, piscicide treatments (chemical substance poisonous to fish), and capture and relocation projects.</p>

<p>Paul Hutchinson, who started with the Dillon Field Office in the early 2000’s has been an integral part of this conservation since the petition for listing, formation of the statewide working group, and ultimately the successes of the MOU and its conservation strategy throughout southwest Montana.</p>

<p>In December 2023, Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks recognized the success of westslope cutthroat trout conservation in Southwest Montana, by awarding Paul Hutchinson the Fish Wildlife and Parks Outstanding Public Service Award, an award typically reserved for Fish Wildlife and Parks employees. Fish Wildlife and Parks has recognized that Paul has been working on southwest Montana westslope cutthroat trout projects longer than most involved and his knowledge and experience is an asset. His work has benefitted not only westslope cutthroat trout, but also permittees that would be largely affected by a westslope cutthroat trout listing. Currently Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks is working on a statewide conservation strategy for westslope cutthroat trout, and other regions are looking to southwest Montana as the model for this plan. They key to success has been the commitment from partnering agencies and Paul Hutchinson has been a big part of this from the beginning.</p>

<p>RIDGECREST, Calif. — The Bureau of Land Management today approved the Alta Wind Battery Energy Storage System right-of-way in Kern County. The project is designed to deliver 150 megawatts of electricity to the California power grid, store up to 1,200 megawatt hours, and increase the reliability and availability of clean power produced by the existing Alta Wind Energy Center.</p>

<p>“Battery energy storage projects like Alta Wind support the delivery of reliable and increasingly clean energy to consumers,” said <em><strong>BLM California Acting State Director Gordon Toevs</strong></em>. “The BLM continues to advance clean energy development and enhance America’s energy security.”</p>

<p>The 25-acre project will be located entirely within the existing right-of-way issued for the Alta 1 Wind Facility. The battery systems will be enclosed in climate-controlled containers with individual clean gas fire suppression systems. Additional information and project documents are available at the <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feplanning.blm.gov%2Feplanning-ui%2Fproject%2F2030259%2F510&data=05%7C02%7Csdenos%40blm.gov%7Cd5e0194e9a0c4a7ca56208dc36f16da1%7C0693b5ba4b184d7b9341f32f400a5494%7C0%7C0%7C638445657749825915%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=aVnpsOm%2FBTSvi%2FBL4YrvRzJ83EDdLQ4fITqH7oMa9K4%3D&reserved=0" target="_blank" title="Original URL: https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2030259/510.

<p>The BLM manages vast stretches of public lands that have the potential to make significant contributions to the nation’s renewable energy portfolio. To promote the development of these energy sources, the BLM provides sites for environmentally sound development of renewable energy on public lands. The efficient deployment of renewable energy from our nation’s public lands is crucial in achieving the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, as well as Congress’ direction in the Energy Act of 2020 to permit 25 gigawatts of solar, wind, and geothermal production on public lands no later than 2025.</p>

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>For our record of the week brought to you by BLM's General Land Office, we go back to 1898 and this survey plat of Tullahassee, Oklahoma.</p>

</div>


<p>What makes Tullahassee special? Primarily that it is believed to be the oldest surviving all-black town in Oklahoma. In 1898 there were about 50 residents of the town just outside of Muskogee. In the early 20th century the population grew to a max of around 200.<br>
<br>
These days the population has dipped below 100, but there are current efforts underway to revitalize the area.</p>

Originating with the Land Ordinance of 1785, cadastral surveys create, define, mark, and re-establish the boundaries and subdivisions of the public lands of the United States. BLM's Cadastral Survey maintains the essential land grid known as the Rectangular Survey System or Public Land Survey System (PLSS) that is the basis for identification of legal descriptions for land parcels. Growing demands placed on public lands and complex land ownership patterns make the importance of accurate boundaries more critical today than ever before. Clearly defined boundaries provide public land managers and the American people with essential information needed to identify rights and privileges and make the best land decisions. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="font-family:Roboto">To say James Beckwourth was a man of many talents is an understatement. A fur trapper. A mountaineer. A Crow Chief. Beckwourth's pioneering spirit helped shape the American West. Born to a mother who endured slavery and a Caucasian father in 1798, Beckwourth's story from slavery to becoming a legendary figure is integral to understanding the development of Utah and the West. The BLM is dedicated to preserving these historical narratives and ensuring that the contributions of African Americans like James Beckwourth are recognized and honored. His story, and those of many others, are pivotal in the rich tapestry of our nation's history and emphasize the BLM's commitment to acknowledging and celebrating these essential contributions to the American narrative.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="font-family:Roboto">James Beckwourth became one of the most iconic adventurers and explorers of his time. He was a remarkable man whose travels led him to the vast landscapes of the West. His most notable achievement, the discovery of Beckwourth Pass—the lowest pass through the Sierra Nevadas in California—paved the way for westward expansion and later became key for the Western Pacific Railroad's Sierra crossing via the Feather River route. </span><span style="font-family:Roboto">His exploits, shrouded in the mystique of his own narratives and the lore of the West, contribute to vibrant history of its lands and peoples.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="font-family:Roboto">James Beckwourth's time in Utah epitomizes the quintessential American West's spirit of adventure, independence, and resilience. Beckwourth is believed to have participated in at least one fur trappers' rendezvous within Utah, an event that highlights the state's importance in the fur trade era. These gatherings took place in various significant locations across the West and were crucial for trade and social interaction among trappers, traders, and Native Americans. Such gatherings served as the lifeblood of the frontier economy and played a crucial role in the dissemination of knowledge, goods, and cultural practices among diverse groups. His ventures in Utah, ranging from trapping in the Cache and Salt Lake valleys to navigating the treacherous waters of the Green River, highlight his indomitable spirit but also his significant role in the early history of Utah. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="font-family:Roboto">The story of James Beckwourth is just one example of the critical role African Americans played in the exploration, settlement, and development of the American West. African American pioneers contributed to every aspect of frontier life, from the fur trade and exploration to serving in the military, ranching, mining, and community building. Their resilience, skills, and contributions were pivotal in shaping the landscapes and communities across Utah and the broader Western territories.</span></span></span></span></p>

## Unhealthy competition

date: 2024-02-28, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>Unhealthy competition</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>Invasive species are a leading risk to native wildlife everywhere, including the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/fish-and-wildlife/sage-grouse">greater sage-grouse</a> and hundreds of other species that depend on healthy sagebrush habitat. Invasive plants compete with sagebrush and native grasses and flowering plants for water and nutrients in the soil, and for living space above and below ground. </p>

<figure role="group">
<div data-embed-button="embed_image" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.wysiwyg_embed" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6e00142d-b207-4e28-9d15-ce784ac23aec" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]" class="embedded-entity"><div>

<figcaption>At first glance, Big sagebrush seems sturdy enough to stand against invasive species like cheatgrass.<br>
However, research shows that it is particularly vulnerable to non-natives. <em>USFWS/Jennifer Strickland</em></figcaption>
</figure>


<p><br>
Aggressive invasives like cheatgrass start growing in the fall and early spring, and so become well-established before native grasses, flowering plants and sagebrush begin their growing seasons. Fewer native plants that are shorter and farther apart mean less of the food and cover that sage-grouse need to survive in all phases of their life cycle. </p>

<p> <br>
Medusahead and ventenata are other competitors. Ventenata is a more recent arrival and appears to be spreading fast. It has minimal value as forage for wildlife or livestock, and may also make the soil more prone to erosion. </p>

<figure role="group">
<div data-embed-button="embed_image" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.wysiwyg_embed" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5e6d3d3b-d893-41df-a66a-711223ff1a2c" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]" class="embedded-entity"><div>

<p> <br>
The most serious consequence of these invasive species is their effect on the cycle of wildfire in sagebrush areas. Wherever plants like ventenata and cheatgrass have replaced native species, fires tend to occur earlier in the year and more frequently. These fires can also burn more intensely and over more acres. </p>

<p><br>
More frequent and more severe fires start a feedback loop that further favors invasive plants. They are able to re-grow in burned areas more quickly than native species and permanently hinder re-establishment of sagebrush and other native plants. </p>

More than half of the sagebrush habitat lost on BLM-managed public lands between 2012 and 2018 resulted from wildfires. Burned areas can be restored, but treatment is costly and uncertain to be effective before sage-grouse and other wildlife are forced to leave the areas permanently. </p>

The BLM manages sagebrush habitat and wildfire in tandem to conserve remaining habitat on public lands to sustain sage-grouse populations until restoration efforts are successful. <br>

The BLM is <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-01-14/2022-next-steps-greater-sage-grouse-conservation">evaluating the plans adopted in 2015</a> to manage sagebrush habitat on public lands. <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-02-04/more-numbers-evaluating-progress-sage-grouse-conservation">Monitoring</a> data and new scientific information published since 2015 will help us determine whether there are steps we should take to benefit sage-grouse and people across the West who also rely on healthy sagebrush lands. <br>

<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. –  The Bureau of Land Management, in partnership with the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office, will offer five saddle-trained wild horses for adoption, in a virtual event via Zoom on Thursday, March 7, at 7 p.m.</p>

<p>Those with approved BLM adoption applications can view the horses in person at the Rio Cosumnes Correctional Facility, 12500 Bruceville Road, Elk Grove, on Sunday, March 3, from noon to 2 p.m. Winning bidders will pick up their horses on Saturday, March 9, at times to be arranged at the above Elk Grove location.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in participating in the online event must first complete a BLM adoption application available <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/4710-010.pdf">online</a> and then email it to Amy Dumas, manager of the BLM-California Wild Horse and Burro Program at <a href="mailto:adumas@blm.gov">adumas@blm.gov</a>. After approval, applicants will receive registration information and a bidder number for the Zoom event. For personal security purposes, the BLM advises against listing Social Security numbers or driver’s license numbers on the application. A BLM representative will contact applicants via phone for that required information.</p>

<p>To qualify, adopters must be at least 18 years old and have facilities that meet the BLM’s requirements. Title to the animals remains with the federal government for a year, after which adopters can apply for title. Detailed information about adopter qualifications and facility requirements can be found <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/wild-horse-and-burro/adoptions-and-sales">online</a>.   </p>

<p>The BLM and Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office have been partners in this program since 2013. Inmates at the Rio Cosumnes Correctional Facility train mustangs to saddle, providing adopters with a solid foundation on which to build additional training. Details and photos of available horses are available at <a href="https://www.blm.gov/californiaR3Cwildhorseadoption">https://www.blm.gov/californiaR3Cwildhorseadoption</a>.</p>

<p>The BLM is responsible under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act for protecting and managing wild horses and burros on public lands. The agency periodically removes animals from the range when populations exceed levels established to allow wild horse and burro herds to thrive in balance with other range users, including wildlife and permitted livestock. These animals are then available for adoption at events throughout the country.</p>

## Grasshopper Falls, Kansas

date: 2024-02-28, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>Grasshopper Falls, Kansas</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>You won't find the town of Grasshopper Falls, Kansas on a modern map. But as our GLO record of the week shows, it was certainly there after being founded in 1859.</p>

<p>Kinda makes you wonder what happened, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Was it bypassed by railroads with residents forced to relocate?</p>

<p>Not the issue. In fact, the town serviced three railroads.</p>

<p>Did it turn into a ghost town when resources or jobs dried up? <br>
<br>
Nope. Not that either.</p>

<p>It was on the banks of the Grasshopper river, so maybe the river overflowed and destroyed the town or was diverted? </p>

<p>No. And you will also have trouble finding the Grasshopper River.<br>
<br>
Might sound crazy, but if you head to Jefferson County, Kansas today, to the exact location shown on this plat, you'll find the town of Valley Falls, with a population of just over 1,000 not on the Grasshopper River, but the Delaware River.</p>

Pretty good, and pretty ironic, reason for a change if you ask us!</p>

<p>FERNDALE, Calif. –  The Bureau of Land Management will offer two yearling fillies and four wild burros for adoption Saturday, March 9, at the Humboldt County Fairgrounds in Ferndale. </p>

<p>Anyone interested can see the available animals between noon and 5 p.m., Friday, March 8.  The adoption begins with a silent auction at 9 a.m. Saturday.  Animals not taken during the auction will be available on a first come, first served basis for a $125 adoption fee.  The BLM’s Adoption Incentive Program applies to this event; adopters receive a check for $1,000, when they receive title to their animals a year after adoption.</p>

<p>To qualify, adopters must be at least 18 years old and have facilities that meet the BLM’s requirements. Title to the animals remains with the federal government for a year, after which adopters can apply for title. Detailed information about adopter qualifications and facility requirements can be found <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/wild-horse-and-burro/adoptions-and-sales">online</a>.</p>

<p>The adoption event is being held in conjunction with the Back Country Horsemen of California Trail Obstacle Challenge, a free event for spectators. The event includes demonstrations on back country horse and burro packing topics, including Dutch oven cooking, predator encounters, trail etiquette and correctly packing gear.</p>

<p>The BLM is responsible under the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/programs_wildhorse_history_doc1.pdf">Wild Free Roaming Horses and Burro Act</a> for protecting and managing wild horses and burros on public lands. The agency periodically removes animals from the range when populations exceed levels established to allow wild horse and burro herds to thrive in balance with other range users, including wildlife and permitted livestock. These animals are then available for adoption at events throughout the country.</p>

<p>NEEDLES, Calif. – The Bureau of Land Management California Desert District welcomes Ron Nuckles as the new field manager for the Needles Field Office. In his role, Nuckles will oversee the management of more than 3.2 million acres of public lands in San Bernardino County. Nuckles started his position today and succeeds Michael Ahrens, who retired in December 2023.</p>

<p>“Ron brings a deep understanding of the BLM’s mission and programs and has experience working with others through challenging issues,” said Shelly Lynch, California Desert District Manager. “We are fortunate to have a field manager who is originally from the area and is familiar with the local communities and landscapes.”</p>

<p>Nuckles started his career with the BLM in 2017, where he managed engineering, maintenance, and support services for the Vale District Office in Oregon. He most recently spent two years as the Assistant Field Manager for the Lake Havasu Field Office in Arizona, managing operations for one of the only lake systems in the BLM, commercial leasing, recreation events, and Tribal relations. Nuckles served in the U.S. Marine Corps and has more than 20 years of federal experience, including eight years at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, and five years with the National Park Service at Joshua Tree National Park and Shenandoah National Park.</p>

<p>“I’m eager to be back in California working with staff, partners, and communities to accomplish the goals of the agency using innovative solutions,” said Nuckles. “I have extensive experience working with various agencies across multiple jurisdictions and understand how to balance stakeholder and community wants and needs, while achieving the BLM’s multiple-use mission.”</p>

<p>Nuckles was born and raised in southern California where he has spent most of his life. In his personal time, Ron enjoys recreating on public lands and waterways with his wife and three kids.</p>

<p>The Needles Field Office manages the eastern most portion of the California Desert Conservation Area which includes a large portion of the 1.6-million-acre Mojave Trails National Monument. The Monument is home to Amboy Crater National Natural Landmark, Afton Canyon Natural Area, Sheephole Valley Wilderness, and encampments of General George S. Patton Jr. The California Historic Route 66 National Scenic Byway also runs through the field office.

## For visitors with low vision, public lands offer more than meets the eye

date: 2024-02-27, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>For visitors with low vision, public lands offer more than meets the eye</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>BLM’s commitment to increasing access to public lands isn’t just about expanding roads, trails, and other infrastructure. It also includes improving access for people with other challenges, such as by augmenting a trail with interpretive audio or Braille signs. Or adding physical aids, like a guide rope, for visitors with low vision to explore areas without assistance.  </p>

<figure role="group" class="align-center">
<div data-embed-button="embed_image" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.wysiwyg_embed" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a775bed4-0339-47e4-bd09-a354d1d5c1f6" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]" class="embedded-entity"><div>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">An estimated 6 million Americans experience vision loss and 1 million experience blindness. More than 1.6 million Americans with vision loss or blindness are younger than age 40. February is <strong>L<a>ow Vision Awareness Month</a></strong>, the perfect time to get out on public lands and experience them with all your senses.</p>

<p>When asked about improving accessibility in ways that benefit those with visual impairments, Kirstin Heins, National Conservation Land Program Lead for BLM California offered, “That sounds like a great partnership opportunity, and we are super into creating or supporting something like this!”</p>

<p>BLM is working to identify additional opportunities to provide visitors with low vision a memorable experience on public lands. In 2022, the <a href="https://www.asdk12.org/">Anchorage School District</a> reached out to Brian Janson, Education Technician at the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/learn/interpretive-centers/campbell-creek-science-center">Campbell Creek Science Center</a>, to see if BLM wanted to work together to develop a field trip for a group of high school students with vision impairments. They met a few times, planning several activities that would be fun, educational, and boost everyone’s confidence. </p>

<p>“I wanted these kids, who rarely went out in nature, to see themselves as the kind of people who could use and enjoy these lands,” Janson said. “That’s the real reward.” </p>

<p>Here are a few other engaging opportunities and activities on public lands for our friends with low vision – and many others looking to expand their horizons – to enjoy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two remote historic sites in Wyoming’s <a href="https://www.blm.gov/office/rock-springs-field-office">Rock Springs Field Office</a>—<a href="https://www.blm.gov/visit/superior-mail-arrow">Superior Mail Arrow</a> and the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/visit/overland-school-interp-site">Overland School Interpretive Site</a>—have Braille interpretive signs. One tells the story of concrete arrows serving as early navigation for pilots transporting mail. The other describes a stagecoach and wagon trail providing an alternate route off the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/national-scenic-and-historic-trails/oregon">Oregon Trail</a> in the late 1800s.</li>
	<li>A 20-minute <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/uploads/1%20Yuha_Audio_Tour_113009_FINAL.mp3">audio tour</a> describes three sites on the Yuha Desert portion of <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/national-scenic-and-historic-trails/Juan-Bautista-de-Anza">Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail</a> in California’s <a href="https://www.blm.gov/office/el-centro-field-office">El Centro Field Office</a>. The audio tour paints a picture of the area and its people, while describing Anza’s expeditions in 1775-1776. </li>
	<li>The <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/california/piedras-blancas-light-station">Piedras Blancas Light Station Outstanding Natural Area</a> in California uses touch activities to enhance sensory experiences for their visitors. While the activity targets 4th grade students, all visitors can put their senses to work and experience something unique. They can pet animal pelts to feel the difference between otter and elephant seal fur; reach into a box to guess if it’s a starfish, urchin, or seashell by touch; or listen to audio demonstrations of sounds of different fog signals.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Another activity from the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/learn/interpretive-centers/campbell-creek-science-center">Campbell Creek Science Center</a> in Anchorage, Alaska, is a listening activity, called <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/Learn_CCSC_Nature-Learning-Downloads_Tuning-into-Birds.pdf">Tuning into Birds</a>. By teaming up with an experienced birder or downloading a birding app, visitors can learn to recognize birds by sound.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to participating in activities involving touch and sound, visitors with low vision – and everyone else – can engage other senses while exploring public lands, including these ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Taste – Research a local area’s First People and bring a picnic lunch with foods that Indigenous peoples traditionally ate such as corn, squash, and beans in the Southwest, or salmon and huckleberries in the Northwest.</li>
	<li>Smell – Differentiate between different types of trees or between bark and needles. Describe the smells in an area – can you smell the plants, the soil, the weather, is there any water nearby?</li>
</ul>

<p> As the photo of <a>Stevie Wonder in the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness in New Mexico</a> demonstrates, the world is more than what we see. Listen to the wind, feel the sand beneath your feet, touch the rock formations, and smell the crisp desert air. </p>

## BLM donates water tender to Cedarville Volunteer Fire Department

date: 2024-02-27, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>BLM donates water tender to Cedarville Volunteer Fire Department</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>The Bureau of Land Management has donated a firefighting water tender to the Cedarville Volunteer Fire Department, increasing the capability of the department that often assists the BLM with wildfires near northeast California communities.</p>

<p>The 1997 diesel powered tender has a 3,000-gallon water tank and is designed to draft water from a source such as a pond, stream or hydrant and haul it to fire engines working on the fireline. This vehicle is ruggedly built and can handle travel to and from wildland fire incidents.</p>

<div data-embed-button="embed_image" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.wysiwyg_embed" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4fe2e67f-1fa7-4ec1-88ef-e2c75ab20b12" data-langcode="en" class="align-center embedded-entity" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]"><div>
  
  




  

            <div class="field contact-block -media-image">  <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/styles/bio_photo/public/images/2024-02/53532628772_d991e1acf0_c.jpg?itok=SAUGNYTD" width="640" height="458" alt="Two men review a document while standing in front of a water truck." typeof="foaf:Image">


</div>
      
</div>
</div>


<p> </p>

<p>“We are happy to donate this engine to the Cedarville Fire Department,” said John Toomey, fire management officer for the BLM Applegate Field Office. “This unit has served the BLM well, and still has plenty of service life left.”</p>

<p>Cedarville Fire Chief Jim Hill said the unit will replace an older water tender. It will support the department’s wildland fire engine and two engines designed for fighting structure fires.</p>

<p>The water tender was provided to the volunteer department under the BLM’s <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/public-safety-and-fire/rural-fire-readiness-program">Rural Fire Readiness Program</a>, which provides equipment to qualifying fire departments that cooperate with the BLM and assist fighting fires on public lands. In the program, local departments apply to receive BLM fire fighting equipment declared surplus when the BLM purchases new equipment.</p>

<p>The water tender went into service in 1997 with the Bakersfield Field Office, where it was steadily utilized until it was replaced about two years ago. Before transferring the truck to the local department, the BLM arranged for inspections and repairs so that it arrived in Cedarville ready for service.</p>

<p>The donation was the fourth in recent years in northeast California. In addition to the water tender donation to Cedarville, the BLM has donated wildland fire engines to the Standish-Litchfield, Milford and Fort Bidwell volunteer fire departments.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 11px;"><em>During Black History Month, we are highlighting outstanding employees who make a difference at the Bureau of Land Management Arizona and beyond. These employees, such as Alexia Williams, strengthen our mission to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.</em></p>

<p><em>“For me, Black History Month means celebrating the accomplishments of the Black Americans that came before us, and those who continue to break barriers, persist, and excel despite the obstacles,” Williams said.</em></p>

<div>
<p><em>From Wyoming to California to Arizona, Williams makes a difference in her stewardship of America's public lands and resources.</em></p>

<p>The sun rises against the Imperial Sand Dunes in El Centro, California.</p>

<p>The early mornings – with 5 and 6 a.m. start times – bring a small crew closer together. The group is scouring survey plots for purple flowers, Peirson's milkvetch, which are popping up across the sand. Peirson's milkvetch, a California endangered plant species, is a flower that is endemic to southern Arizona and northern Mexico.</p>

<p>Among them, Alexia Williams.</p>

<p>At BLM California, Williams, who was an outdoor recreation planner, was driven by a love of public lands to help wherever she could, even in areas beyond her title.</p>

<p>Williams was an outdoor recreation planner for seven years at BLM California’s El Centro Field Office, from 2016 to 2023. “When I was thinking about my career and where it was going, I wanted to seek out more project management opportunities,” she said.</p>

<p>That led her back to Tucson, where she also earned her Bachelor of Science in ecology and evolutionary biology, along with a minor in conservation biology, from the University of Arizona in 2014.</p>

<p>“Back when I graduated college, I actually did not know what the BLM was. But an internship opportunity came up, and I didn't know what I was going to do,” she said. “It was an awesome opportunity for all of us who applied.” That summer after graduating she was an outdoor recreation planner at the BLM Kemmerer Field Office through the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/careers/students-and-grads/direct-hire-program">DHA-RAI program</a>.</p>

<p>“After two years, I decided Wyoming was a little too cold, and my parents lived in Yuma, Arizona, after military service,” she said. El Centro is only about an hour away from Yuma.</p>

<p>“When I was in El Centro, I did a lot of visitor contacts out in the Imperial Sand Dunes and a couple of other open OHV areas, and I got the question a lot about how to get into the federal government. It came up more times than I can count,” she said. “I explained to everyone that I had gotten in through an internship, but there are a variety of ways to get into public service.”</p>

<p>“My advice for those interested in working in the federal government is to keep an open mind,” Williams said. At the BLM, there are a variety of ways to get into federal service, including through an internship like Williams did. “Many of us started as seasonal employees, interns, contractors, etc., and typically even volunteer experience counts towards the qualifications.”</p>

<p>After her own stints at BLM Wyoming and BLM California, Williams is now a project manager focused on Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act-funded projects in the Bureau of Land Management Arizona’s Gila District.</p>

<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act funds about 50 projects in the Gila District on BLM-managed public lands. These projects would not be successful without the passion and hard work of project managers like Williams.</p>

<p>These projects that Williams works on include a lot of collaboration, she said. Often, there are multiple agencies, cities, and even states collaborating on different projects, she explained. For example, the Gila District cooperates with several local cities, counties, and friends’ groups in water management such as groundwater and surface water monitoring and modeling.</p>

<p>“In seeing that kind of collaboration, you would have no idea it is taking place if you're not involved in it,” she said. “That is an interesting aspect of this position.”</p>

<p>The Bureau of Land Management’s Gila District alone encompasses the management of over two million acres of desert, mountains, and grasslands in eastern and southeastern Arizona – and this management is supported by countless partnerships and other agencies. The BLM partners with many diverse organizations to carry out our multiple-use mission.</p>

<p>“Managing for multiple uses definitely poses a challenge, but hopefully the decisions now will lead to a more sustainable future,” she said.<br>
<br>
“I love that public lands support a variety of activities such as free camping and hiking, fee sites with amenities such as boat launches, filming and photography, birdwatching, picnicking, orienteering, rocket-launching, etc., and the fact that there are landscapes that are protected such as Wilderness Areas,” she said. “Visitors come from all over the world to take advantage of these opportunities, and it would be awesome if more Americans were aware of these resources right here at home.”</p>
