on traditional methods for combating malaria and emerging
Wolbachia-based interventions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The escalating challenge of malaria control necessitates innovative
approaches that extend beyond traditional control strategies. This
review explores the incorporation of traditional vector control
techniques with emerging Wolbachia-based interventions. Wolbachia, a
naturally occurring bacteria, offers a novel approach for combatting
vector-borne diseases, including malaria, by reducing the mosquitoes’
ability to transmit these diseases. The study explores the rationale for
this integration, presenting various case studies and pilot projects
that have exhibited significant success. Employing a multi-dimensional
approach that includes community mobilization, environmental
modifications, and new biological methods, the paper posits that
integrated efforts could mark a turning point in the struggle against
malaria. Our findings indicate that incorporating Wolbachia-based
strategies into existing vector management programs not only is feasible
but also heightens the efficacy of malaria control initiatives in
different countries especially in Pakistan. The paper concludes that
continued research and international collaboration are imperative for
translating these promising methods from the laboratory to the field,
thereby offering a more sustainable and effective malaria control
strategy.</p>

rhamnosus GG powder supplementation alleviates intestinal injury in
piglets challenged by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has become a challenging
problem in pig industry worldwide, causing significant profit losses.
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) has been regarded as a safe probiotic
strain and has been shown to exert protective effects on the intestinal
dysfunction caused by PEDV. This study evaluated the effect of LGG on
the gut health of lactating piglets challenged with PEDV. Fifteen
piglets at 7 days of age were equally assigned into 3 groups (5 piglets
per group): 1) control group (basal diet); 2) PEDV group: (basal diet +
PEDV challenged); 3) LGG + PEDV group (basal diet + 3×109 CFU/pig/day
LGG + PEDV). The trial lasted 11 days including 3 days of adaptation.
The treatment with LGG was from D4 to D10. PEDV challenge was carried
out on D8. PEDV infection disrupted the cell structure, undermined the
integrity of the intestinal tract, and induced oxidative stress, and
intestinal damage of piglets. Supplementation of LGG improved intestinal
morphology, enhanced intestinal antioxidant capacity, and alleviated
jejunal mucosal inflammation and lipid metabolism disorders in
PEDV-infected piglets, which may be regulated by LGG by altering the
expression of TNF signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, and fat
digestion and absorption pathway.</p>

virus infection in human microglial C20 cells induces
mitochondria-mediated apoptosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionChikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is associated with
acute clinical manifestations and chronic joint inflammation. CHIKV has
emerged as a significant causative agent of central nervous system (CNS)
complications, including encephalitis and related sequelae. Microglial
cells, crucial for immune responses and tissue repair in the CNS, play a
vital role in the host response to viral infections, with their
activation potentially leading to either protection or pathology. In
this study, the infection biology of CHIKV in the C20 human microglial
cell line was investigated.MethodsThe permissiveness of C20 cells to
CHIKV infection was assessed, and viral replication kinetics were
compared to Vero E6 cells. Cytopathic effects of CHIKV infection on C20
cells were examined, along with ultrastructural changes using
transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, apoptosis induction,
mitochondrial membrane potential, and alterations in cell surface marker
expression were evaluated by flow cytometry.ResultsCHIKV infection
demonstrated permissiveness in C20 cells, similar to Vero cells,
resulting in robust viral replication and cytopathic effects.
Ultrastructural analysis revealed viral replication, mature virion
formation, and distinctive cytoplasmic and nuclear changes in infected
C20 cells. CHIKV infection induced significant apoptosis in C20 cells,
accompanied by mitochondrial membrane depolarization and altered
expression of cell surface markers such as CD11c, CD14, and HLA-DR.
Notably, decreased CD14 expression was observed in CHIKV-infected C20
cells.DiscussionThe study findings suggest that CHIKV infection induces
apoptosis in C20 microglial cells via the mitochondrial pathway, with
significant alterations in cell surface marker expression, particularly
CD14 that is linked with apoptosis induction. These observations provide
valuable insights into the role of human microglial cells in the host
response to CHIKV infection and contribute to the knowledge on the
neuropathogenesis of this virus.</p>

machine learning algorithms and single-cell analysis to identify gut
microbiota-related macrophage biomarkers in atherosclerotic plaques</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThe relationship between macrophages and the gut microbiota
in patients with atherosclerosis remains poorly defined, and effective
biological markers are lacking. This study aims to elucidate the
interplay between gut microbial communities and macrophages, and to
identify biomarkers associated with the destabilization of
atherosclerotic plaques. The goal is to enhance our understanding of the
underlying molecular pathways and to pave new avenues for diagnostic
approaches and therapeutic strategies in the disease.MethodsThis study
employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and
differential expression analysis on atherosclerosis datasets to identify
macrophage-associated genes and quantify the correlation between these
genes and gut microbiota gene sets. The Random Forest algorithm was
utilized to pinpoint PLEK, IRF8, BTK, CCR1, and CD68 as gut
microbiota-related macrophage genes, and a nomogram was constructed.
Based on the top five genes, a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
algorithm was applied to construct gut microbiota-related macrophage
clusters and analyze their potential biological alterations. Subsequent
single-cell analyses were conducted to observe the expression patterns
of the top five genes and the interactions between immune cells.
Finally, the expression profiles of key molecules were validated using
clinical samples from atherosclerosis patients.ResultsUtilizing the
Random Forest algorithm, we ultimately identified PLEK, IRF8, CD68,
CCR1, and BTK as gut microbiota-associated macrophage genes that are
upregulated in atherosclerotic plaques. A nomogram based on the
expression of these five genes was constructed for use as an auxiliary
tool in clinical diagnosis. Single-cell analysis confirmed the specific
expression of gut microbiota-associated macrophage genes in macrophages.
Clinical samples substantiated the high expression of PLEK in unstable
atherosclerotic plaques.ConclusionGut microbiota-associated macrophage
genes (PLEK, IRF8, CD68, CCR1, and BTK) may be implicated in the
pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques and could serve as diagnostic
markers to aid patients with atherosclerosis.</p>

of novel Plasmodium falciparum coronin gene mutations in a recrudescent
ACT-treated patient in South-Western Nigeria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRoutine surveillance for antimalarial drug resistance is
critical to sustaining the efficacy of artemisinin-based Combination
Therapies (ACTs). Plasmodium falciparum kelch-13 (Pfkelch-13) and
non-Pfkelch-13 artemisinin (ART) resistance-associated mutations are
uncommon in Africa. We investigated polymorphisms in Plasmodium
falciparum actin-binding protein (Pfcoronin) associated with in vivo
reduced sensitivity to ART in Nigeria.MethodsFifty-two P. falciparum
malaria subjects who met the inclusion criteria were followed up in a
28-day therapeutic efficacy study of artemether-lumefantrine in Lagos,
Nigeria. Parasite detection was done by microscopy and molecular
diagnostic approaches involving PCR amplification of genes for Pf18S
rRNA, varATS, telomere-associated repetitive elements-2 (TARE-2).
Pfcoronin and Pfkelch-13 genes were sequenced bi-directionally while
clonality of infections was determined using 12 neutral P. falciparum
microsatellite loci and msp2 analyses. Antimalarial drugs
(sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, amodiaquine, chloroquine and some
quinolones) resistance variants (DHFR_51, DHFR_59, DHFR_108, DHFR_164,
MDR1_86, MDR1_184, DHPS_581 and DHPS_613) were genotyped by
high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis.ResultsA total of 7 (26.92%)
cases were identified either as early treatment failure, late
parasitological failure or late clinical failure. Of the four
post-treatment infections identified as recrudescence by msp2 genotypes,
only one was classified as recrudescence by multilocus microsatellites
genotyping. Microsatellite analysis revealed no significant difference
in the mean allelic diversity, He, (P = 0.19, Mann-Whitney test). Allele
sizes and frequency per locus implicated one isolate. Genetic analysis
of this isolate identified two new Pfcoronin SNVs (I68G and L173F) in
addition to the P76S earlier reported. Linkage-Disequilibrium as a
standardized association index, IAS, between multiple P. falciparum loci
revealed significant LD (IAS = 0.2865, P=0.02, Monte-Carlo simulation)
around the neutral microsatellite loci. The pfdhfr/pfdhps/pfmdr1 drug
resistance-associated haplotypes combinations,
(108T/N/51I/164L/59R/581G/86Y/184F), were observed in two
samples.ConclusionPfcoronin mutations identified in this study, with
potential to impact parasite clearance, may guide investigations on
emerging ART tolerance in Nigeria, and West African endemic
countries.</p>

diets induce inflammatory IMD/NFκB signaling via gut microbiota
remodeling in Drosophila</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>High-fat diets (HFDs), a prevailing daily dietary style worldwide,
induce chronic low-grade inflammation in the central nervous system and
peripheral tissues, promoting a variety of diseases including
pathologies associated with neuroinflammation. However, the mechanisms
linking HFDs to inflammation are not entirely clear. Here, using a
Drosophila HFD model, we explored the mechanism of HFD-induced
inflammation in remote tissues. We found that HFDs activated the
IMD/NFκB immune pathway in the head through remodeling of the commensal
gut bacteria. Removal of gut microbiota abolished such HFD-induced
remote inflammatory response. Further experiments revealed that HFDs
significantly increased the abundance of Acetobacter malorum in the gut,
and the re-association of this bacterium was sufficient to elicit
inflammatory response in remote tissues. Mechanistically, Acetobacter
malorum produced a greater amount of peptidoglycan (PGN), a well-defined
microbial molecular pattern that enters the circulation and remotely
activates an inflammatory response. Our results thus show that HFDs
trigger inflammation mediated by a bacterial molecular pattern that
elicits host immune response.</p>

insights into the diversity, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance of
group B Streptococcus clinical isolates from Saudi Arabia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionDetailed assessment of the population structure of group
B Streptococcus (GBS) among adults is still lacking in Saudi Arabia.
Here we characterized a representative collection of isolates from
colonized and infected adults.MethodsGBS isolates (n=89) were sequenced
by Illumina and screened for virulence and antimicrobial resistance
determinants. Genetic diversity was assessed by single nucleotide
polymorphisms and core-genome MLST analyses.ResultsGenome sequences
revealed 28 sequence types (STs) and nine distinct serotypes, including
uncommon serotypes VII and VIII. Majority of these STs (n=76) belonged
to the human-associated clonal complexes (CCs) CC1 (33.71%), CC19
(25.84%), CC17 (11.24%), CC10/CC12 (7.87%), and CC452 (6.74%). Major CCs
exhibited intra-lineage serotype diversity, except for the hypervirulent
CC17, which exclusively expressed serotype III. Virulence profiling
revealed that nearly all isolates (94.38%) carried at least one of the
four alpha family protein genes (i.e., alphaC, alp1, alp2/3, and rib),
and 92.13% expressed one of the two serine-rich repeat surface proteins
Srr1 or Srr2. In addition, most isolates harbored the pilus island
(PI)-2a alone (15.73%) or in combination with PI-1 (62.92%), and those
carrying PI-2b alone (10.11%) belonged to CC17. Phylogenetic analysis
grouped the sequenced isolates according to CCs and further subdivided
them along with their serotypes. Overall, isolates across all CC1
phylogenetic clusters expressed Srr1 and carried the PI-1 and PI-2a
loci, but differed in genes encoding the alpha-like proteins. CC19
clusters were dominated by the III/rib/srr1/PI-1+PI-2a (43.48%, 10/23)
and V/alp1/srr1/PI-1+PI-2a (34.78%, 8/23) lineages, whereas most CC17
isolates (90%, 9/10) had the same III/rib/srr2/P1-2b genetic background.
Interestingly, genes encoding the CC17-specific adhesins HvgA and Srr2
were detected in phylogenetically distant isolates belonging to ST1212,
suggesting that other highly virulent strains might be circulating
within the species. Resistance to macrolides and/or lincosamides across
all major CCs (n=48) was associated with the acquisition of erm(B)
(62.5%, 30/48), erm(A) (27.1%, 13/48), lsa(C) (8.3%, 4/48), and mef(A)
(2.1%, 1/48) genes, whereas resistance to tetracycline was mainly
mediated by presence of tet(M) (64.18%, 43/67) and tet(O) (20.9%, 14/67)
alone or in combination (13.43%, 9/67).DiscussionThese findings
underscore the necessity for more rigorous characterization of GBS
isolates causing infections.</p>

and efficacy against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii of a
novel Friunavirus phage from sewage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has become a new
threat in recent years, owing to its rapidly increasing resistance to
antibiotics and new effective therapies are needed to combat this
pathogen. Phage therapy is considered to be the most promising
alternative for treating CRAB infections. In this study, a novel phage,
Ab_WF01, which can lyse clinical CRAB, was isolated and characterized
from hospital sewage. The multiplicity of infection, morphology,
one-step growth curve, stability, sensitivity, and lytic activity of the
phage were also investigated. The genome of phage Ab_WF01 was 41, 317 bp
in size with a GC content of 39.12% and encoded 51 open reading frames
(ORFs). tRNA, virulence, and antibiotic resistance genes were not
detected in the phage genome. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic
analyses suggest that phage Ab_WF01 is a novel species of the genus
Friunavirus, subfamily Beijerinckvirinae, and family Autographiviridae.
The in vivo results showed that phage Ab_WF01 significantly increased
the survival rate of CRAB-infected Galleria mellonella (from 0% to 70%
at 48 h) and mice (from 0% to 60% for 7 days). Moreover, after day 3
post-infection, phage Ab_WF01 reduced inflammatory response, with
strongly ameliorated histological damage and bacterial clearance in
infected tissue organs (lungs, liver, and spleen) in mouse CRAB
infection model. Taken together, these results show that phage Ab_WF01
holds great promise as a potential alternative agent with excellent
stability for against CRAB infections.</p>

of Campylobacter jejuni adhesion to biotic model surfaces by fungal
lectins and protease inhibitors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Campylobacter jejuni, a Gram-negative bacterium, is one of the most
common causes of foodborne illness worldwide. Its adhesion mechanism is
mediated by several bacterial factors, including flagellum, protein
adhesins, lipooligosaccharides, proteases, and host factors, such as
surface glycans on epithelial cells and mucins. Fungal lectins,
specialized carbohydrate-binding proteins, can bind to specific glycans
on host and bacterial cells and thus influence pathogenesis. In this
study, we investigated the effects of fungal lectins and protease
inhibitors on the adhesion of C. jejuni to model biotic surfaces (mucin,
fibronectin, and collagen) and Caco-2 cells as well as the invasion of
Caco-2 cells. The lectins Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) and
Laccaria bicolor tectonin 2 (Tec2) showed remarkable efficacy in all
experiments. In addition, different pre-incubations of lectins with C.
jejuni or Caco-2 cells significantly inhibited the ability of C. jejuni
to adhere to and invade Caco-2 cells, but to varying degrees.
Pre-incubation of Caco-2 cells with selected lectins reduced the number
of invasive C. jejuni cells the most, while simultaneous incubation
showed the greatest reduction in adherent C. jejuni cells. These results
suggest that fungal lectins are a promising tool for the prevention and
treatment of C. jejuni infections. Furthermore, this study highlights
the potential of fungi as a rich reservoir for novel anti-adhesive
agents.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bunyaviruses are a large group of important viral pathogens that
cause significant diseases in humans and animals worldwide. Bunyaviruses
are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses that infect a
wide range of hosts. Upon entry into host cells, the components of
viruses are recognized by host innate immune system, leading to the
activation of downstream signaling cascades to induce interferons (IFNs)
and other proinflammatory cytokines. IFNs bind to their receptors and
upregulate the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs). Many ISGs have antiviral activities and confer an antiviral
state to host cells. For efficient replication and spread, viruses have
evolved different strategies to antagonize IFN-mediated restriction.
Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the
interactions between bunyaviruses and host innate immune response.</p>
