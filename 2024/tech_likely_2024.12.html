in the 80s before many of you were born, you could buy a word processing
program, which was basically a text editor, and you could use it to
write and then when it came time to send that writing to other people,
you would print it. And get this the printer could take its input from
any of those writing tools. There were no
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a>. The printers didn’t come with their own editors, you had
choice and therefore there was lots of competition. Amazing, right?</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-22, from: Manu - I write blog</p>

</p>
<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Hello! I’m Taylor (mayor of
<a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a>).
</p>
<p>
I collect hobbies, build things, incite chaos, and engage in elaborate
tomfoolery. I work as a developer, designer, DB architect,
<a href="https://taylor.town/hire-me">and other things</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What’s the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I created my first personal website to quickly teach myself how to make
websites, because I fudged my resume and accidentally landed a job as a
web developer before I was ready.
</p>
<p>
My website became a blog when I posted my digital notebooks online circa
2015. I maintained hundreds of markdown files on various topics and
ideas, but I was too embarrassed to publish most of the actual notes, so
I replaced the body of each file with “Coming soon!”. My private
ideas.txt file sits at 110,427 words right now. This does not include
hundreds of unfinished essays, papers, books, stories, games, gadgets,
etc.
</p>
<p>
As I grew more specific and organized, my notes became easier to digest.
In 2019, I started writing about
<a href="https://taylor.town/the-speedy-media-manifesto">my
opinions</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/synthetic-intelligence">my
fears</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/time">my inspirations</a>, and
<a href="https://taylor.town/how-do-taoists-quit-smoking">my
paradoxes</a>.
</p>
<p>
But I didn’t start writing seriously
<a href="https://taylor.town/1000-weekends">until I stopped drinking in
2022</a>. Writing was welcome respite from alcohol withdrawals. Without
booze to fill my emptiness, I suddenly found myself with plenty of
“boring” hours. So I kept writing. And now I can’t stop writing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I consume absurd amounts of
<a href="https://taylor.town/books">books</a>,
<a href="https://blogs.hn/">small blogs</a>,
<a href="https://taylor.town/music">music</a>,
<a href="https://taylor.town/podcasts">podcasts</a>, and other internet
media.
</p>
<p>
From there, my inspiration ferments in a 1Mb text file called ideas.txt.
When I’m not doing chores, I start from the top of ideas.txt and work my
way down, making small
<a href="https://taylor.town/pseudoprose">pseudoprose</a> edits along
the way. An idea usually sits at the top of the list for a few months
before it’s ripe enough to publish.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an excerpt from the top of my list on Dec 7, 2023:

<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Countless creations die in the pursuit of Ideal Creative Environments.
After hearing how much quality work Tyler Cowen completes while
traveling, I taught myself how to
<a href="https://taylor.town/between-time">scrounge for in-between
time</a>. Through that process, I made more time for creative pursuits
via
<a href="https://taylor.town/extinguish-all-notifications">extinguishing
notifications</a> and <a href="https://taylor.town/nowify">bespoke
time-tracking software</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, most of my creative process occurs on couches – just me and my
laptop. When I need more real-estate, I use
<a href="https://taylor.town/my-battlestation">my battlestation</a>.
When my thoughts become tangled, I clean my home or play with my
daughter or walk outside. When I draw, I use our makeshift art studio in
the basement. And so on.
</p>
<p>
Everything in a home or office eventually becomes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness#Invisible_Gorilla_Test">invisible
gorillas</a>. In my experience, physical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propinquity">propinquity</a> is
the fastest way to modulate creativity. Unsurprisingly, surrounding
myself with healthy and supportive people was a really good way to
become healthy and supported.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<ul>
<li>
All my writings are markdown files (with YAML frontmatter) in a GitHub
repo.
</li>
<li>
An ugly Elixir script converts each file into HTML and compiles
<a href="https://taylor.town/feed.xml">an atom feed</a>.
</li>
<li>
All of these files are served to the public via Cloudflare Pages.
</li>
<li>
Every few weeks, I copy/paste stuff into
<a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> for
<a href="https://newsletter.taylor.town/">my email newsletter</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<ul>
<li>
More doodles! I’m still working up the courage to share more of my
drawings…
</li>
<li>
People cannot spell “Troesh” from memory, so I’m glad I chose
<a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a> over
<a href="https://taylor.troe.sh/">taylor.troe.sh</a>. But I’ll never
know if <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a> was a better
choice than <a href="https://taylor.land/">taylor.land</a>.
</li>
<li>
If I started over, I probably wouldn’t write my build script in Elixir –
maybe Haskell or Go or JS instead?
</li>
<li>
I wasted a lot of time on essay ideas that were time-consuming but
obviously worthless. I should’ve learned earlier to sort by
<a href="https://dom.iowa.gov/resource/lean-resources/impact-difficulty-matrix-template">difficulty
vs. impact</a>.
</li>
<li>
I’m still unsure about Instagram, X, and other socials media. I love
meeting strangers via email – am I missing cool people from other
corners of the web?
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
It costs $0 to host my blog on GitHub and Cloudflare. I spend $30/mo on
Buttondown. I once hoped that my blog would land me some sweet
consulting gigs. As of 2023, total consulting revenue is $0.
</p>
<p>
I aim to be worth
<a href="https://taylor.town/dollar-per-hour">$1/hour</a>. Advertising
is spooky, so I’ve been working on books and games and services to sell
instead. But it’s hard to juggle making worthwhile art while working for
an employer while publishing free content.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I support <a href="https://www.patreon.com/todepond">TodePond</a> and
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/hundredrabbits">Hundred Rabbits</a> via
Patreon.
</p>
<p>
I would also love to support
<a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/">Experimental History</a>
and <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/">Escaping Flatland</a>, but
I’m avoiding Substack for now.

Sivers</a>, <a href="https://sonnet.io/">sonnet.io</a>,

<a href="https://stephango.com/">Steph Ango</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Things I’ve made recently:
</p>
<ul>
<li>

<h2 id="united-states-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-apple">United
States files antitrust lawsuit against Apple</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>For many years, Apple has built a dominant iPhone platform and
ecosystem that has driven the company’s astronomical valuation. At the
same time, it has long understood that disruptive technologies and
innovative apps, products, and services threatened that dominance by
making users less reliant on the iPhone or making it easier to switch to
a non-Apple smartphone. Rather than respond to competitive threats by
offering lower smartphone prices to consumers or better monetization for
developers, Apple would meet competitive threats by imposing a series of
shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines and
developer agreements that would allow Apple to extract higher fees,
thwart innovation, offer a less secure or degraded user experience, and
throttle competitive alternatives. It has deployed this playbook across
many technologies, products, and services, including super apps, text
messaging, smartwatches, and digital wallets, among many others. Apple’s
conduct also stifles new paradigms that threaten Apple’s smartphone
dominance, including the cloud, which could make it easier for users to
enjoy high-end functionality on a lower priced smartphone—or make users
device-agnostic altogether. As one Apple manager recently observed,
“Imagine buying a Android for 25 bux at a garage sale and it works fine
… And you have a solid cloud computing device. Imagine how many cases
like that there are.” Simply put, Apple feared the disintermediation of
its iPhone platform and undertook a course of conduct that locked in
users and developers while protecting its profits. Critically, Apple’s
anticompetitive conduct not only limits competition in the smartphone
market, but also reverberates through the industries that are affected
by these restrictions, including financial services, fitness, gaming,
social media, news media, entertainment, and more. Unless Apple’s
anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct is stopped, it will likely
extend and entrench its iPhone monopoly to other markets and parts of
the economy. For example, Apple is rapidly expanding its influence and
growing its power in the automotive, content creation and entertainment,
and financial services industries–and often by doing so in exclusionary
ways that further reinforce and deepen the competitive moat around the
iPhone. ↫ DoJ antitrust lawsuit vs. Apple The United States Department

<h2 id="why-i-dont-write-dev-posts">Why I don’t write dev posts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There are some 400 or so blog posts on this site. I could be wrong but I think I wrote precisely 1 dev focused post. I wrote a few blog posts here and there that are tangentially work-related because they’re about projects I worked on but that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
There’s a reason why I don’t write about dev stuff. And it’s not because
I find it boring or uninspiring. Quite the contrary. I love learning
about web stuff. I love reading Robin’s
<a href="https://robinrendle.com/the-cascade/">The Cascade</a> for
example. There’s always something new happening on the web, especially
in the frontend space. And as a—former?—designer I love learning about
front-end stuff.
</p>
<p>
The reason why I don’t write about dev stuff it’s because, like many
others, I suffer from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor
syndrome</a>. I’ve been working on the web for more than 12 years. I’m
still convinced I don’t know shit. I scroll through
<a href="https://minimal.gallery/">minimal.gallery</a> or
<a href="https://onepagelove.com/">OPL</a>, see the work of all those
great designers and developers, and reinforce this idea that there are,
in fact, countless people out there who are better than me.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, the rational part of me knows that’s not entirely
true. Of course there are people that are better than me. There will
always be people better than me at literally everything. Still, this
sensation of not knowing shit keeps following me around and it’s the
reason why I don’t write about web stuff. This is also the reason why I

Hank Green posted
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W92bjv8fNTI">a video about four
lies he believed</a>. It’s a great video because it’s embarrassing to be
wrong on the internet and here is smart person™️ Hank Green admitting he
believed some bullshit. As you travel through the internet you’re
constantly working against a lot of personal biases, like confirmation
bias or the overconfidence bias, and it’s easy to slip up. It’s
(biologically) difficult to correct your understanding as new facts
invalidate what you believed true.
</p>
<p>
One simple question I’ve started asking a lot is: “How do you verify
that?”
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen some compelling demos where LLMs take a jumble of text and
spit out compelling artifacts like an image,
<a href="https://openai.com/sora">some b-roll</a>, a spreadsheet,
<a href="https://salt-nlp.github.io/Design2Code/">a website</a>, or
<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/podcast">an entire daily news
podcast</a>. It’s incredible… until my buzzkill brain starts asking
questions. Images are easy to verify: does image look correct or does it
contain phantom limbs and have five rows of teeth? Text summary or
expansion, also within possibility to verify. A website? I mean… I can
tell you if it’s an okay website code-wise but I’m probably an outlier
here. Validating the accuracy of a larger corpus of data that got
summarized, keyworded, and categorized? Oof. This is where the scales
tip for me because it seems improbable. Or at least time consuming.
Perhaps as time consuming as it takes to do the work yourself?
</p>
<p>
To be fair to the robots (<em>why would I ever say this?</em>) I think
it’s worth pointing the question at myself. I’ve been thinking about my
“old world” method of verifying facts and determined I have the
following routine.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I consume a lot
</li>
<li>
I experiment
</li>
<li>
I ask experts
</li>
</ol>
<p>
When I say “consume a lot”, I mean I read hundreds – sometimes thousands
– of articles and watch hundreds of videos each week (cf. novelty
seeking, information addiction) as well as
<a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">my book habit</a>. To make
that theoretical knowledge more practical, I prototype and experiment to
answer questions. With a basic understanding established, I often ask
experts for their perspective. For web tech, that’s lots of open
questions or DMs to people I know care about a specific technology. I’ll
then sometimes have those people on my podcast to prod them some
more.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Like loose change and shells rattling inside a coffee can, I collect all
those informational tidbits and filter them through my years of
experience and
<a href="https://media1.giphy.com/media/gW0cPZopjtpoA/giphy.gif">how my
brain works</a>. That produces an outcome I’m generally satisfied with,
informed yet potentially wrong. It’s not too different from an LLM where
the outputs are only as good as their inputs.
</p>
<p>
My inputs are sometimes flawed.
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/if-books-could-kill/id1651876897">If
Books Could Kill…</a> is a podcast where the hosts do takedowns of my
favorite books: self-help pop-psychology airport books. They do an
incredible job at on-the-fly fact checking, reading criticisms,
scrutinizing every assertion, asking “Hey wait, is that true?” on every
page and have nearly ruined the entire genre for me. I assume you learn
this brand of skepticism in journalism school and the trade-off is that
you’ll never enjoy a book again in your life. But I need to remind
myself the goal of a book isn’t to get to the last page, it’s to expand
your thinking.
</p>
<p>
I wish I did better at this (so I don’t repeat falsehoods) but
collecting factoids makes me feel smart and I like feeling smart so now
they’re insulated inside a little blanket of my personal biases.
Fact-checking in realtime doesn’t tickle the ol’ grey matter. It doesn’t
have the same dopamine response.
</p>
<p>
One more story and I’ll let you go. In an effort to not be a total
fucking grandpa all the time I’m trying to use AI more while keeping an
open mind. It’s been… challenging. But the other day I needed a fact
checked – something one of my investors mentioned during our YCombinator
application process that was noodling around in my head – and a regular
search didn’t return any results, so I tried a trending AI search tool
that provides citations.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
First it told me “Yes, this was true” but cited the wrong reasons.
</li>
<li>
So I hit it with an “Are you sure?” and it changed its answer to “No,
it’s not true” but cited a random Hacker News comment that asserted the
opposite.
</li>
<li>
So I said “Your source says the opposite” and it KFC doubledown’d and
said “No, it’s not true.”
</li>
<li>
So I copy-pasted the text from their own source into the prompt and it
said “Yes, this was true.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That’s a… complex user journey. And it happens to me a lot. I wonder if
this tech falls victim to its own compelling demos. The
“<a href="https://indieweb.social/@johnallsopp/112050757204780359">Time
to First Demo</a>” is so short and often so profound, we fill in the
possibilities with our own projections and science fiction. It’s harder
to question the quality or veracity when our imaginations and our biases
get wrapped up in the idea because it might mean questioning ourselves…
which is not something humans are biologically engineered to do well.
</p>
<p>
Okay, this is the last bit I promise. There’s one line from that Hank
Green video that stands out to me in this whole self-fact-checking
debacle…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I was fine with having the [mis]information put into my head, but when I
put it into someone else’s head, I felt a little weird about it so I
went to check just in case.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That seems like a humane approach to sharing information. Be liberal in
what you accept, fact-check on the way out. I hope I can get better at
that.
</p>

Asking experts isn’t limited to tech either, if I share an area of

<h2 id="why-were-lucky-wordpress-is-here-and-other-topics">Why we’re
lucky WordPress is here and other topics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I spent some time this week reviewing the UI of Radio UserLand, released
in 2002. It was both a feed reader and a writing tool.
</p>
<p>
One would have thought, btw, that from that start that all subsequent
blogging tools would have the same connections, even if the
functionality was not all in the same product. But then came Twitter and
Facebook, and they said they weren’t blogs, and presumably would start a
new tradition with new user expectations. And that worked. The new
blogging platforms were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo">silos</a>.
</p>
<p>
So the integration opportunities were limited, something that took me 11
years to fully appreciate, and to
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">give
up</a> on. I was in a intellectual cloud, not thinking straight.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, the tradition of blogging was preserved by WordPress. As a
blogging tool, it supported the same connective features that Radio did.
There were some it couldn’t cover because Radio was a desktop app, not a
web app (though it looked like a web app, you installed a piece of
software on the desktop).
</p>
<p>
This was the
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html">Fractional
Horsepower HTTP Server</a> idea realized.
</p>
<p>
So for example, we had
<a href="http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/howUpstreamingWorks">upstreaming</a>,
which was a one-way Dropbox, a number of years before Dropbox existed.
This meant that the link between the CMS and the server went through the
file system. The product didn’t live long enough to fulfill the
potential of that feature. The idea was that you could use any editor
you wanted to write something that was posted to the blog, you could
choose to have it rendered through the site template, or uploaded as-is.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png">editor</a>
we supplied with Radio was one of those
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a>, but I hoped that better editors would emerge. I wanted to
make one myself, combining the outliner in Frontier with scripting, to
drop posts into the folder structure that Radio expected.
</p>
<p>
<div class="divInlineImage">
<center>
<img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png">
</center>
Radio’s tiny little textbox circa 2002.
</div>
</p>
<p>
Years later I tried to do it with Dropbox itself, with a product called
<a href="http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html">Fargo</a>. Dropbox was
so incredibly close to the ideal user-owned storage server system, but
they wouldn’t go the final step, in creating a class of content that
could be shared with two or more apps but not all apps. So the user
didn’t have enough control for it to work.
</p>
<p>
The idea of multiple apps working on the same data would be
revolutionary. How do I know? Because that’s how computers worked before
the web. So to make the thing I want to do work, now, in 2024, I’m going
to have to create my own storage system for the user, and I will pay for
it, at least to start.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully at some point I’ll be able to turn that over to Automattic and
have them run it, or if they don’t want to, maybe someone else will. But
it has to be there for the web as a runtime environment to support the
same diversity of software that the PC and Mac did in the generation
before the web.
</p>
<p>
Technology does go backwards, a lot – we lose valuable things without
any thought, when we could keep them.
</p>
<p>
BTW, that’s why it’s good to keep some old people around, we might
remember the things that were lost. I’m trying to make sure the really
good ideas, the keepers, get another chance.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/blogrollscreen.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Another
random morning bit – something subtle in the blogroll you might not have
noticed. It has no trouble dealing with titled or untitled posts. Blog
posts typically have titles, social media posts do not.
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> is opinionated
about this – it
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/rssIsOpinionatedAboutOptionalTitles.png">says</a>
you should support both views. But the feed reader folk ignored that
guidance. My little blogroll shows you how to do it, it’s pretty simple.
<span>If it doesn’t have a title use the description</span>.
</p>
<p>
Think of it this way. What if motorcycles, cars, trucks and bikes
couldn’t all use the same roads? What kind of way would that be to run a
civilization. Same thing with feeds.
</p>
<p>
There’s a screen shot of the blogroll to the right, with Scripting News
highlighted and expanded. Some of those posts have titles and some
don’t. You and I as developers care about that, but we shouldn’t show
that difference that in the user interface. The users don’t care and
rightly so. It’s confusing and takes their attention away from the
writing.
</p>
<p>
Another topic. Something I noticed in WordPress’s RSS feeds. If I start
a post out with an empty title, it uses the post ID to form the URL for
the post. That’s the right thing to do imho. But then if I add a title,
which can happen, it changes the URL to use the title. But URLs
shouldn’t change. It also changes the guid, so a feed reader will think
there were two posts when there was just one. Now I don’t know if they
can change it at this late date, I imagine there are workarounds out
there. But I noticed this the other day, and thought I should mention
it. Why not just use the post ID for the guid, esp since it says the
guid is not a permalink? And use it in forming the URL. I totally
understand the benefit of using the title in the URL. But you can’t
depend on the title being there.
</p>
<p>
Finally, to answer the question raised by the title of this piece –
WordPress is, among other things, a perfect time capsule of open
technologies from the early days of innovation on the web, and widely
deployed and able to deliver all their benefits, if we widen our view of
social media to be a <i>social web,</i> and simply create places where
posts with and without titles are equally supported. It’s that simple.
Without WordPress we would have to build all that, and wait for it to
deploy in numbers, to matter in the market. All we have to do now is
make the connections.

MiniBook X (2023): a lot of laptop for very little money</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>What if the kind of laptop you’re looking for just isn’t available
from any of the major or even minor manufacturers? You know exactly what
you want out of a laptop, and while quite a few fulfill many of your
requirements, the requirement that matters most just isn’t being made.
It’s not a case of “too expensive” or “too cheap” – simply nobody will
sell it to you. From HP, Dell, Apple, down to smaller and local OEMs,
none of them can serve your particular set of needs. For me, that
particular requirement, that particular need is that of the laptop with
an 8″ to 10″ screen size. Even the most portable laptops sold by
well-known brands today stop at 13″, often even 14″, with nowhere to go
but up. I currently have a 13.3″ laptop – an otherwise excellent XPS 13
9370 with a gorgeous 4K display – but as much as I love it, it’s just
too big and heavy for me. I want something smaller, no bigger than
roughly 10″. Why? Well, I use my laptop in exactly two locations: on the
couch in one of our two living rooms, or in bed (okay that’s technically
three locations). That’s it. I work from home on my workstation, I play
games on my gaming PC, so I don’t need big performance on the road, nor
do I need a big portable display to make working on the go bearable. On
top of all this, I have two small kids running around the house, so a
laptop that is easier to quickly close and put out of harm’s way is very
welcome. And considering the most intensive workload it’ll ever have to
contend with is playing YouTube video, I don’t need the latest Core i7
or Apple M3 either. Why not a tablet, then? First and foremost, I want
to use a desktop operating system, not Android or iOS, since writing
OSNews posts or doing a quick translation for my job are not fun
experiences on mobile operating systems. On top of that, a tablet with a
keyboard accessory often makes use of a kickstand and flappy keyboard,
which are cumbersome to use on the couch, in bed, or on your lap. The
exception here would be the iPad with a Magic Keyboard, but that’s an
incredibly expensive affair and an Apple product, so obviously a no-go.
Luckily, while the kind of small laptop I’m looking for is not available
from one of the major OEMs, there are a small number of specialised OEMs
that do focus on making small laptops. Roughly, the devices they make
fall into one of three pricing categories. First, there’s the high-end –
these usually start at around €800 or so and get well over €1000, and
have a decent set of specs, often focused on gaming by opting for AMD
APUs. A major player in this market is GPD, who’ve been offering
products in this segment for years, and are actually a decently
well-known brand at this point, even being featured on major YouTube
channels like Linus Tech Tips. Then there’s the very low end, a market
segment drowning in the exact same 7″ laptop priced at €250 or so, sold
under a variety of brand names, sporting the same low-end Celeron chip
and rather crappy display. It’s also quite thick, made out of cheap
plastic, and every review I’ve seen of these are not particularly
positive. Unless you know what you’re getting into, do not buy these.
They’re e-waste trash. In recent times, however, a middle segment has
slowly started to take shape, coming in price points in between the low
and high end, with reasonable specifications and build quality, without
going overboard. This was exactly what I was looking for. Aside from
price and specifications, mini-laptops also come in a variety of
different input layouts. Being smaller than other laptops, some
compromises will have to be made, and it’s this particular aspect that
will most likely play a major role in which models appeal to you. The
gaming-focused mini laptops will often come with dual joysticks and face
buttons, while other models will come with a more traditional keyboard
and trackpad, and the smallest laptops in this category ditch the
trackpad in favour of a little sensor pad in the top-right of the
keyboard, or a ThinkPad-style nipple. Having kept and eye on this market
for years now, I knew exactly what I was looking for: I wanted a
traditional keyboard and touchpad layout, with medium specifications, a
capable display, and all-metal construction, for no more than roughly
€400-500. Clearly, the time to strike was now, as the small,
budget-oriented OEM Chuwi had just updated its 10″ mini laptop with
Intel’s latest low-power processor, the N100. The Chuwi Minibook X
(2023), as it’s called, has an all-aluminium construction, and comes
with quite decent specifications, and I managed to snag a new model
through their eBay store for a mere €320 (I asked them for a discount
down from €400 , and they gave it; I did not mention who I was or that I
run OSNews). It has the aforementioned Alder Lake Intel N100 – released
earlier this year, it’s an Intel 7 processor with 4 cores and 4 threads
(so no hyperthreading) with a maximum turbo frequency of 3.4 Ghz, with a
TDP of just 6 W. It’s not going to compare well to the various Core
i3/i5/i7 processors, of course, but considering the type of device, it
makes perfect sense to opt for something like the N100. Furthermore,
this device is packing 12 GB of LPDDR5 RAM running at 4800 Mhz, and my
model comes with a 512 GB SSD. The display is a 10.3″ panel with a
native resolution of 1920×1200, with a refresh rate of only 50Hz
(although some people managed to reach 60Hz and even 90Hz), and support
for touch. Ports-wise, it has two USB-C ports (one marked as compatible
with charging – I haven’t dared</p>

<h2 id="gnome-46-released">GNOME 46 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>GNOME 46 has been released, and its packs a ton of new features and
improvements. One of the headline improvements is the new global search
feature. Files comes with a new global search feature in GNOME 46. The
feature is simple: activate it by clicking the new search button, or by
using the Ctrl+Shift+F shortcut, then enter your query to search all
your configured search locations. Global search is a great way to jump
directly into search, without having to think about where the items you
want are located. The new feature also leverages GNOME’s existing file
search capabilities, including the ability to search the contents of
files, and filter by file type and modification date. ↫ GNOME 46 release
notes GNOME 46 also brings experimental support for variable refresh
rate in Mutter, GNOME’s window manager, the Files application has seen a
lot of work to drastically improve performance, the Settings application
has been reworked, OneDrive support has been added to online accounts,
and much more. Remote login has also been greatly improved. GNOME’s
remote desktop experience has been significantly enhanced for version
46, with the introduction of a new dedicated remote login option. This
allows remotely connecting to a GNOME system which is not already in
use. Connecting in this way means that the system’s display can be
configured from the remote side, resulting in a better experience for
the remote user. GNOME 46 will make it to your distribution of choice
over the coming weeks and months.</p>

<h2 id="i-was-a-hackintosher">I was a Hackintosher</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<p>
I can’t speak for anyone else but I can tell you why I did it.
</p>
<p>
I was broke, I know PCs and Macs and Mac OS X – I ran OS X 10.0, 10.1
and 10.2 on a PowerMac 7600 using
<a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/10291-xpostfacto" rel="ugc">XPostFacto</a>.
</p>
<p>
I got the carcase of a Core 2 Extreme PC on my local Freecycle group in
2012.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/lproven/status/257060672825851904" rel="ugc">https://twitter.com/lproven/status/257060672825851904</a>
</p>
<p>
RAM, no hard disks, no graphics, but case/mobo/CPU/PSU etc.
</p>
<p>
I took the nVidia card and hard disks from my old Athlon XP. I got the
machine running, and thought it was worth a try since it was mostly
Intel: Intel chipset, Intel CPU, etc.
</p>
<p>
I joined some fora, did some reading, used Clover and some tools from
<a href="https://www.tonymacx86.com/" rel="ugc">TonyMacX86</a> and so
on.
</p>
<p>
After two days’ work it booted. I got no sound from my SoundBlaster
card, so I pulled it, turned the motherboard sound back on, and
reinstalled.
</p>
<p>
It was a learning experience but it worked very well. I ran Snow Leopard
on it, as it was old enough to get no new updates that would break my
Hack, but new enough that all the modern browsers and things worked
fine. (2012 was the year Mountain Lion came out, so I was 2 versions
behind, which suited me fine – and it ran PowerPC apps, and I preferred
the UI of the PowerPC version of MS Word, my only non-freeware app.)
</p>
<p>
I had 4 CPU cores, it was maxed out with 8GB RAM, and it was nice and
quick. As it was a desktop, I disabled all support for sleep and
hibernation: I turn my desktops off at night to save power. It drove a
matched pair of 21” CRT monitors perfectly smoothly. I had an Apple
Extended keyboard on an ADB-to-USB convertor since my PS/2 ports weren’t
supported.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t totally reliable – occasionally it failed to boot, but a power
cycle usually brought it back. It was fast and pretty stable, it ran all
the OS X FOSS apps I usually used, it was much quicker than my various
elderly PowerMacs and the hardware cost was essentially £0.
</p>
<p>
It was more pleasant to use than Linux – my other machines back then ran
the still-somewhat-new Ubuntu, using GNOME 2 because Unity hadn’t gone
mainstream yet.
</p>
<p>
Summary: why not? It worked, it gave me a very nice and perfectly usable
desktop PC for next to no cost except some time, it was quite
educational, and the machine served me well for years. I still have it
in a basement. Sadly its main HDD is not readable any more.
</p>
<p>
It was fun, interesting, and the end result was very usable. At that
time there was no way I could have afforded to buy an Intel Mac, but a
few years, one emigration and 2 new jobs later, I did so: a 2011 i5 Mac
mini which is now my TV-streaming box, but which I used as my main
machine until 2017 when I bought a 27” Retina iMac from a friend.
</p>
<p>
Cost, curiosity, learning. All good reasons in my book.
</p>
<p>
This year I Hacked an old Dell Latitude E7270, a Core i7 machine maxed
out with 16GB RAM – with Big Sur because its Intel GPU isn’t supported
in the Monterey I tried at first. It works, but its wifi doesn’t, and I
needed to buy a USB wifi dongle. But performance wasn’t great, it took
an age to boot with a lot of scary text going past, and it didn’t feel
like a smooth machine. So, I pulled its SSD and put a smaller one in,
put ChromeOS Flex on it, and it’s now my wife’s main computer. Fast,
simple, totally reliable, and now I have spare Wifi dongle. :-/ I may
try on one of my old Thinkpads next.
</p>
<p>
It is <em>much</em> easier to Hackintosh a PC today than it was 10-12
years ago, but Apple is making the experience less rewarding, as is
their right. They are a hardware company.<br /><br />(Repurposed from a

<h2 id="trusting-content-on-the-kde-store">Trusting content on the KDE
Store</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>A global theme on the KDE third party store had an issue where it
executed a script that removed user’s data. It wasn’t intended as
malicious, but a mistake in some shell parsing. It was promptly
identified and removed, but not before doing some damage to that user.
This has started a lot of discourse around the concept of the store,
security and upstream KDE. With the main question how can a theme have
access to do this? ↫ David Edmundson That ‘some damage’ was personal
data loss, which is quite something to happen after installing a theme.
KDE kind of shot itself in the foot here by having something called
‘global themes’, which is a combination of themes for various elements
of the desktop, like the application style, icon theme, cursor theme,
colour scheme, and so on, but also things like panel layout and even
widgets, applets, and other things that can run code. Some of these
global themes use shell scripts to implement the more advanced aspects
of their themes, and all these things combined means that global themes
installed through KDE’s own built-in theme installer can cause some
serious damage. The problem is getting some attention now, and I hope
they can find a way to make this process more transparent for end users,
so people know what they’re getting themselves into. I’m not advocating
for dumbing all this stuff down – this isn’t iOS or whatever – but
better communication, perhaps clearer labels and warnings are definitely
needed.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-write-a-qml-effect-for-kwin">How to write a QML effect
for KWin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>In order solve that problem, we started looking for some options and
the most obvious one was QtQuick. It’s a quite powerful framework and
it’s already used extensively in Plasma. So, in Plasma 5.24, we
introduced basic support for implementing kwin effects written in QML
and even added a new overview effect. Unfortunately, if you wanted to
implement a QtQuick-based effect yourself, you would still have to write
a bit of C++ glue yourself. This is not great because effects that use
C++ are a distribution nightmare. They can’t be just uploaded to the KDE
Store and then installed by clicking “Get New Effects…”. Furthermore,
libkwin is a fast moving target with lots of ABI and API incompatible
changes in every release. That’s not good if you’re an effect developer
because it means you will need to invest a bit of time after every
plasma release to port the effects to the new APIs or at least rebuild
the effects to resolve ABI incompatibilities. This has been changed in
Plasma 6.0. In Plasma 6, we’ve had the opportunity to address that pesky
problem of requiring some C++ code and also improve the declarative
effect API after learning some lessons while working on the overview and
other effects. So, enough of history and let’s jump to the good stuff,
shall we? ↫ Vlad Zahorodnii Making it easier to write things like Plasma
widgets and Kwin effects is always desirable, and making them easier to
distribute is only icing on the cake.</p>

<h2 id="john-romero-doesnt-believe-in-prototypes">John Romero doesn’t
believe in prototypes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
A couple weeks ago I joined
<a href="https://social.lol/@tylersticka/112005607463887992">a
conversation about John Romero and prototypes</a>.
<a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/the-possibility-bridge/">Tyler
posted some thoughts about Romero’s autobiography</a>,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott/112005791745972036">Matthias
shared a quote from a Tim Ferris podcast</a> where Romero chided
prototypes, and Matthias looped me in because I love prototypes.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go. Don’t depend on
polish happening later. Always maintain constantly shippable code.<br />
– John Romero,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzqdZAYcwfY">Strange Loop
2002</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A quick internet conversation changed the course of my week a bit. After
that short exchange I dove in and listened to podcasts, watched a
handful of talks, and read an entire
<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-john-romero/18230638?ean=9781419758119">autobiography</a>…
and I’m still shocked that John Romero doesn’t believe in prototypes.
</p>
<h2>
id Software is synonymous with speed
</h2>
<p>
To understand Romero’s perspective you need to understand the ethos of
id Software. id Software was –to borrow a gaming term– a “Press W”
company, meaning they tend to plow through all obstacles to keep forward
momentum. As Romero recounts in his biography, they prioritized speed
above all other design principles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Speed in gameplay
</li>
<li>
Speed in development
</li>
<li>
Speed in using the latest tech
</li>
<li>
Speed in heavy metal MIDI soundtracks
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Romero and Carmack were also prolific developers.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero#Games">Romero has
over 100 titles to his name</a> and in 1991 they released 15 games! And
they did this while simultaneously pioneering 3D video game graphics for
Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and DOOM (1993). How did they maintain such
velocity?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Good division of labor.</strong> Carmack worked on the game
engine, Romero on the level design, and Tom Hall did the art.
</li>
<li>
<strong>They lived together.</strong> I’m not advocating for workplace
cohabitation, but I think you need to acknowledge the contextual
environment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Knew the hardware.</strong> Carmack and Romero were intimately
familiar with the limitations of the hardware they were developing
against which made porting games to other platforms (Commodore, Amiga,
etc) a lot more predictable.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Always rewriting</strong>. They were always rewriting using the
latest tech. Take an existing title and use the latest graphic
capabilities, take an existing title and make it with the latest engine,
rinse and repeat.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Built internal tools.</strong> Romero built internal tools to
speed up level design:
<a href="https://keenwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/TED5">TEd</a> (a text-based
level editor), <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DoomEd">DoomEd</a>,
and <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/QuakeEd">QuakeEd</a>. Romero
frequently talks about making DOOM levels in a single night.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Predictable scope.</strong> While the underlying graphics or
physics engine might change dramatically, the formula for the scope of
the game (number episodes, levels, weapons, and types of enemies) stayed
nearly the same so you could repeat processes, reduce code churn, and
avoid surprise hardware limitations.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That formula gave the team a lot of shots on goal. To use another sports
metaphor, that’s a lot of reps. id Software was crunch time all the
time. Abiding in that breakneck thrill ride enabled them to create
groundbreaking, industry-defining titles like DOOM and Quake.
</p>
<h2>
Back to prototypes and the lack thereof…
</h2>
<p>
Okay. Back to the main plot. John Romero doesn’t like prototypes…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Speed is great, but process effects outcomes. In Romero’s own words
“Don’t depend on polish happening later” which is something those of us
in tech know all too well. You’re probably going to run up against
“<a href="https://devopedia.org/iron-triangle">the Iron Triangle</a>” at
some point.
</p>
<p>
I’m not trying to throw shade – I will never be as successful as id
Software – but here’s a side-by-side of two similar side-scroller games.
</p>
<figure>
<div class="gallery"
style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: var(--fluid-pad, 1.5vw); max-width: 640px;">
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mario.png" alt="Super Mario Bros (1985)">
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/keen.png" alt="Commander Keen (1990)"></p>
</div>
</figure>
<p>
One is a game from a company that prioritizes prototyping and using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi#Lateral_Thinking_with_Withered_Technology">withered
technology</a> (Super Mario Bros, 1985), the other is a clone of that
game from a company that prioritizes shipping quick on the latest
hardware (Commander Keen, 1990). This isn’t an attempt to strip the game
of its technical achievements, bringing Nintendo-like games to the PC,
but there’s a palpable difference between the two; one is timeless and
one is timely. While a myriad of skill, staffing, and technology factors
contribute to the
difference<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>,
I believe the biggest delta comes down to pressing the publish button
too early.
</p>
<p>
There’s a
<a href="https://www.acriticalhit.com/solved-miyamoto-quote-late-game-bad-forever">famously
misattributed</a> quote that seems apropos here…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“A delayed game is eventually good. A bad game is bad forever.”<br /> –
Siobahn Beeman, often misattributed to Shigeru Miyamoto
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Who cares if some “<a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/brzalrzi">not
spectacular</a>” graphics slipped out the door? That game, Commander
Keen, was successful. id Software was successful. Over and over. From my
perspective that comes down to the sheer volume of ideas they shipped,
that continuous practice, and their novel shareware distribution model
coinciding with the explosion of the internet and the PC. You need to be
responsive and reactive to that wave and if there’s a commitment to
release a new product every month, then I wouldn’t recommend a thinking
tool like prototypes under those limitations either.
</p>
<p>
Do I –without evidence– believe they actually did prototype a bit? Yes.
I think in the sense of experimenting with level design or evaluating
community mods, they could cheaply explore new ideas with low effort
thanks to their level editor tools. All those throwaway ideas amount to
some level of what I’d call prototyping. But I take Romero’s point that
they didn’t believe in prototyping, they were working on the product,
not an idea, and could have hit publish at any point in the process.
</p>
<p>
So I’ll concede that maybe with a pair of once-in-a-generation talent, a
perfect mixture of group workaholism, a breakneck cadence, all living in
the same house, a convergence of new technologies, quality internal
tools, the explosion of the home computer industry, an original and
extremely violent IP that appealed to the Metallica generation, and over
a hundred shots on goal… you too might be able to capture lightning in a
bottle and create a smash hit like “the entire concept of 3D video
games”…
</p>
<p>
… but for the rest of us there’s prototypes.

<h2 id="from-ink-to-pixel-to-ink">From ink to pixel to ink</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I love books. I love reading books but I also love books as objects. And if you’re a designer—or passionate about design—chances are, you also love books. There’s something about the book, as an object, that managed to survive across all the various societal and technological changes.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
In the 2010s, during the peak iPad era, people thought paper books were
doomed. What’s the point of printing something when you can get
hundreds, or even thousands of books inside a single device? And I’ll be
honest with you, I went through that phase myself. For years I was only
reading on an iPad. And it was great. Until it wasn’t.
</p>
<p>
There’s something about a printed book that technology can’t replace. I
can’t tell you exactly why but I’m sure you know what I’m talking about.
Reading a book, handling a book, smelling the ink and the paper, seeing
it age over time, those are things that can’t be reproduced in the
digital space.
</p>
<p>
I love books. I love when people pour their hearts and souls into
creating great books. And I’m not just talking about the writing. Or the
photographing. Or the illustrating. I’m talking about caring about the
book itself, as an object.
</p>
<p>
That’s one of the reasons why I keep buying every book
<a href="https://shop.specialprojects.jp">Craig Mod makes</a>. The man
knows how to make great books. And you can feel it. You can instantly
tell he loved the process as soon as you pick up one of his books.
</p>
<p>
I never had to make a book myself. I designed a few, back when I was
studying graphic design more than a decade ago. But I did experience
firsthand what it means to care about creating a great book. That’s
because I watched Carl and my brother working together to create the
first volume of the
<a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture">Minimalissimo
Selection</a> series. The final product is an incredibly simple object
but creating simple objects is painfully hard.
</p>

</div>
<figcaption>
If you’re into minimalism and architecture this is a book for you
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Before websites like Minimalissimo were a thing, you had to buy books to
find visual inspiration. And now you have books created as a result of
years of curation of those same websites. From ink, to pixel, and back
to ink.
</p>
<p>
The iPad didn’t manage to kill books the same way smartphones didn’t
manage to kill traditional photography. The more we digitize the world
the more analogue, physical objects become important. And as creators,
it’s important to care about creating quality objects. Because as they
say if is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
A final note about the lovely book Carl made. It was a limited run and
there won’t be a second edition. But,
<a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture">there
are still copies left so if you want one I suggest you act fast</a>.
Carl was also kind enough to set up a 25% discount for the readers of
this site. Just use the <code>SELECTION25</code> code at checkout.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you love books, and coffee, and great filmmaking, Antonio
Carusone created an amazing promotional video for the book that I’ll
embed down below.

<p>You know those modal screens that interrupt your groove when you are
surfing? There are no laws forcing websites to use them. They use them
because they choose to. ↫ Bite code! Cookie banners are not only not
required, they’re not even needed, and most implementations you
encounter today are illegal anyway. You can use session cookies and
anonymous stats cookies without needing any user approval. Companies
like to use these cookie banners because they want to make you mad at
the law, not at them for tracking you up the wazzoo, and people who
actually do know better trot out the cookie banners to enrage you at the
government instead of at the corporations exploiting you. EU law only
states that if a website wants to track you, they have to let you know.
That’s it. Seems very reasonable to anyone who isn’t a corporatist.</p>

<p>When they report on Trump’s financial situation they don’t take into
account that the property, golf courses, buildings, etc are all
mortgaged beyond the max, that’s what the NY trial was about, him lying
about values for the purpose of getting loans on the property. So his
equity in these investments is probably 0 or even negative (because of
the fraud). No one is going to loan him anything on the properties,
because he has no equity, and the story they tell about New York state
liquidating his assets, there almost certainly is nothing to liquidate.
Anyone who owns a home and has a mortgage can understand this, it works
the same way even if the property is much more valuable than a family
home. I asked jokingly what his credit rating must be, but it’s a good
question to ask, would help regular people relate to the situation.</p>

<p>Developing great products is something like the NBA which they always
say is a business, esp when a player you love is traded. Happened
recently with a point guard, Immanuel Quickley, traded from Knicks to
Raptors. He wasn’t the only heart of the Knicks, but he was one of them.
He has a competitive grace you don’t see very often. Quickley was one of
those guys you knew would be the starting point guard on some NBA team,
he was that good. But he was unlikely to get there on the Knicks, so we
can be happy for him because he is the starting point guard on the
Raptors, but we lost something important there. But the business side,
if done well, opens the door for bigger love. I love watching the Knicks
win they way they are winning now. That’s what I want from developing
software. I want to create a global team of truly independent
developers, filling the void left by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">predation</a> of the
silos. There won’t even be a business model for much of what we do, but
there will be lots of teamwork and lots of fun, because the best
accomplishment is when we do it as a team. We’re going to play a game we
started to play in the mid-90s, and somewhere somehow forgot we could
still play it. We can. I am old now, I feel it, I can’t produce end-user
software much longer, but I don’t want to leave until we have this thing
rebooted.</p>

13 is the end of the FreeBSD version</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Bad news from BSD land – the oldest vendor of BSD systems is changing
direction away from FreeBSD and toward Linux. NAS vendor iXsystems has
been busy this year, but apart from some statements in online user
communities, it hasn’t been talking about the big news. Back in 2022, we
covered TrueNAS CORE 13, the new release of its FreeBSD-based turnkey OS
for NAS servers, and in that article we mentioned its new product, the
Debian-based TrueNAS SCALE, aimed at providing storage for Kubernetes
users. Now it seems the company is betting its future on that
Linux-based product, meaning the end is in sight for the FreeBSD
offering. ↫ Liam Proven at The Register Very sad to read, as more
monoculture is not exactly great, but at the same time, from a corporate
perspective, it’s also not entirely unexpected to focus on the server
operating system with by far the widest industry support. I hope the
fork mentioned in the article gains some steam, because having
competition in this space is crucially important.</p>

<p>Blogroll fix. The blogroll was grabbing the up and down-arrow and
Return for keyboard navigation, one of my favorite blogroll features.
Put the cursor where you want, and arrow through the list. Press Return
to expand, and again to collapse. Then down-arrow and repeat. But
sometimes you want to use these keys for other functions. So I changed
it so you have to click the blogroll to set the focus. Its border turns
blueish, and the keys work as described. Press the Tab key or click
outside the blogroll to take the focus off the blogroll.</p>

working with developers again, thank goodness. I once thought I could
make server products or toolkits for people I called “poets” – motivated
writers. I have given up on that, at least for the time-being. I think a
properly motivated intelligent writer could get developer-like results,
I’ve seen it happen (Brent Simmons, Dan MacTough). They make really good
developers because they understand the user perspective so well, it
still lives inside them. The problem seems to be motivation, and a poet
knowing that they need to be super-motivated and have the time, to get
<i>anything</i> technical to work. If they knew what was required, my
2024 theory goes, and had studied for it, the way they studied for their
degree, they could not only be successful, but they could contribute to
the developer process. Analogously, we all have to learn a little
cooking just to get through life, but only a few people are chefs.

<h2 id="trapped-in-the-iron-age">
Trapped in the Iron Age
</h2>
<p>
In 1836, Danish antiquarian and curator Christian Jürgensen Thomsen
distinguished three prehistorical eras based on the dominant materials
used for weapons and cutting implements: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age,
and the Iron
Age.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Thomsen’s classification refers to the past, but according to his
criteria, we have never evolved beyond the Iron Age. Even in the 21st
century, iron remains the dominant material, not just for weapons and
cutting implements but for about every modern technology.
</p>
<p>
We now use most iron in the form of steel. However, according to
Thomsen’s criteria, we cannot speak of a “Steel Age.” First, steel is
merely an alloy of iron (&gt;98%) and carbon (&lt;2%). Second, humans
have been producing steel since the beginning of the Iron Age. That is a
little-known fact in the Western world, where steel production only took
off in the nineteenth century with fossil fuels. However, Asian and
African metallurgists developed high-quality steels much earlier, and
this knowledge eventually allowed Europeans to do the same – on a much
larger
scale.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By 2021, the global iron and steel output reached 1,950 million tonnes
(Mt). That is 22 times larger than the combined aluminum and copper
output (88 Mt). The global iron and steel output corresponds to five
times the global plastics output (391 Mt) and dwarfs the worldwide
production of silicon (8.5 Mt) and lithium (0.1
Mt).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
Steel is the fundamental material of industrial societies. Without
plastics, lithium, or silicon, we would still be in an industrial
society. Without iron and steel, we would be thrown back 3,000 years
into the Bronze Age.
</p>
<h2 id="where-is-all-that-steel">
Where is all that steel?
</h2>
<p>
The massive presence of steel in industrial society is not so
obvious.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
At home, we find several steel appliances such as the refrigerator,
washing machine, water boiler, bathtub, and cooking, heating, and
cooling appliances. However, only 2-3% of total steel production ends up
in domestic
appliances.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
Outdoors, there’s a lot of steel in the form of vehicles. These are
especially passenger cars that use around 10% of all steel globally (20%
in rich countries). Busses, trucks, trains, and ships add another 4-5%.
Altogether that is still less than 20% of the global steel output.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Most steel is embedded in other materials, located underground, or far
away from residential areas.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Most steel is embedded in other materials, located underground, or far
away from residential areas. More than half of global steel production
goes into construction, which includes buildings (residential,
commercial, industrial) and infrastructures (bridges, tunnels, harbors,
canals, runways, oil rigs, refineries, pipelines, power plants,
transmission lines, railways, subways, and so on). Much of that steel is
embedded in concrete. Reinforced concrete is the world’s primary
building material, and concrete is the only material that can match the
output of steel (1,819 Mt in 2021).
</p>
<p>
Roughly 15% of global steel production serves to make machinery,
including machine tools, industrial equipment, electrical hardware, and
construction, mining, and farming machines. Even products made of other
materials – such as other metals, plastics, and wood – are shaped by
steel
tools.<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
The final 15% of steel production ends up in a variety of objects, from
screws over food packaging to furniture and shipping
containers.<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>

<h2 id="the-environmental-footprint-of-the-steel-industry">
The environmental footprint of the steel industry
</h2>
<p>
Steel is often presented as one of the most sustainable materials.
Unlike plastics, steel can be recycled without any loss in quality. The
steel industry has made great advances in energy efficiency, more so
than many other industries. Making one ton of crude steel now requires
roughly 20 gigajoules (GJ) of primary energy on average – three times
less than in
1950.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>
This compares very favorably to other materials such as aluminum (175
GJ/t), plastics (80-120 GJ/t), or copper (45
GJ/t).<sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Unlike plastics, steel is a biodegradable
material.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>
Finally, iron ore is not in short supply. It makes up 5 percent of the
Earth’s crust and is fourth in abundance among the
elements.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>
For comparison, copper only makes up
0.01%.<sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
However, despite all these advantages, the global iron and steel
industry consumes more energy and produces more carbon emissions than
any other industry. The total primary energy use of crude steel
production was 39 exajoules (EJ) in 2021, which corresponds to 7% of all
energy used worldwide in that year (595 EJ). The greenhouse gas
emissions are even higher because around 75% of energy use comes from
coal – the fuel with the highest carbon emissions. In 2021, the iron and
steel industry produced 3.3 Gt of carbon emissions, roughly 9% of global
emissions (36.3
Gt).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>
The concrete industry follows closely with 8%.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The iron and steel industry consumes more energy and produces more
carbon emissions than any other industry.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The estimates above come from the <em>World Steel Association</em> and
the <em>International Energy Agency</em>. These data are available for
all metals and have been documented over a long period, allowing for
historical comparisons. However, they only refer to the smelting of the
metal. They do not include the energy use and carbon emissions for
mining and transporting iron ore, coal, limestone, scrap, and steel
products. Nor do they include the energy and emissions for coke
production and ore preparation – all essential to the steel production
process.<sup id="fnref3:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scientific studies that have set wider boundaries for the iron and steel
industry conclude that the energy cost of steel production increases by
50% to
100%.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>
One report concludes that the methane emissions from metallurgical coal
mining alone could increase emissions by 27%. Another study estimates
that seaborne transport of iron ore and steel adds 10-15% extra
emissions.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>
Iron and steel production also create other environmental problems, such
as high water use, solid waste production, and significant air and water
pollution.
</p>
<p>
The carbon footprint of the iron and steel industry is incompatible with
current ambitions to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050, even less
so because steel production is very likely to expand further. Steel
production grew tenfold since 1950 and doubled between 2000 and 2020,
growing faster than many researchers had
predicted.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>
Furthermore, efficiency gains have decreased, and there is a scientific
consensus that current technologies have reached their thermodynamic
limits.<sup id="fnref4:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>
During the last two decades, the average energy use for the production
of 1 ton of steel has remained around 20
GJ/t.<sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-steel-without-fossil-fuels">
How to make steel without fossil fuels?
</h2>
<p>
There are two ways to make steel, and one is much more sustainable than
the
other.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>
On the one hand, there is the blast furnace or basic oxygen furnace, in
which steel is made from iron ore and coal. This technology is – in its
essential form – 2000 years old. On the other hand, there is the
electric arc furnace, in which steel is made from steel scrap and
electricity. The electric arc furnace, which is a relatively new
technology, consumes much less energy than the blast furnace, makes use
of a recycled resource (no need to mine iron ore), and works without the
direct use of coal or other fossil fuels (the electricity can be
supplied by solar, wind, or atomic power).
</p>
<p>
The most energy-efficient electric arc furnaces now consume less than
300 kilowatt-hours of electricity per ton of steel
produced.<sup id="fnref3:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>
Hypothetically, if we had produced all steel in 2021 (1,950 Mt) in such
furnaces, the total power consumption of the global iron and steel
industry would have been only 585 terawatt-hours (Twh). That corresponds
to just one-third of all electricity generated by wind turbines
worldwide in the same year (1,848 Twh). Unfortunately, more than 70% of
global steel output was made in blast furnaces fed by coal and iron
ore.<sup id="fnref4:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>
A blast furnace consumes twenty times more energy and cannot be operated
by electricity because coal is both the fuel source and the chemical
reductant. The combustion of coal produces carbon monoxide that reduces
the iron from its
ore.<sup id="fnref5:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="not-enough-scrap-available">
Not enough scrap available
</h2>
<p>
The solution seems obvious: let’s produce all that steel in electric arc
furnaces. However, this is impossible. There’s not enough scrap
available: the continuous growth of the global steel output makes a
circular flow of resources
impossible.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>
It takes decades before most steel becomes available for recycling. For
example, there is 543 Mt of steel stocked in
ships.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>
The scrap available for recycling in 2021 corresponds to the production
level of 1965 when global steel production was less than one-quarter of
what it is today (450
Mt).<sup id="fnref5:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
Consequently, the other three quarters need to be produced in blast
furnaces using coal and freshly mined iron ore.

<p>
Nowadays, China produces roughly half of the steel in the world and does
that almost exclusively (+90%) in blast furnaces using coal and iron
ore. Many other steelmaking nations have a higher share of electric arc
furnaces. However, it makes little sense to point the finger at China.
First, the US and Europe have outsourced many of their industries to
China since the 2000s, a trend that corresponds neatly with the growing
steel output in that country. Furthermore, twenty to forty years ago,
China hardly used any steel. Consequently, there is almost no scrap
available. China has no other choice than to use blast
furnaces.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="ever-higher-grades-of-steel">
Ever higher grades of steel
</h2>
<p>
A second obstacle is the continuous development of higher grades of
steel. There are now over 2,500 different types of steel with a variety
of properties, such as increased strength, tolerance to high
temperatures, or corrosion
resistance.<sup id="fnref6:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref6:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
Although these higher quality steels can be produced in electric arc
furnaces, they are not made from scrap, and they have much higher energy
use.
</p>
<p>
Steel available for recycling forms a mix of steel grades. That mix is
suitable for making plain carbon steel but not highly alloyed steels,
which require scrap with similar qualities. However, that scrap is not
available. For example, stainless steel, the most produced special steel
grade, has a recycling rate of only 15%. Almost 60 Mt of stainless steel
was produced in 2021, compared to only 4 Mt in
1980.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>
The traditional use of stainless steel was in cutlery, surgical tools,
and medical and food processing equipment. However, it is now also used
in the construction of tunnels and outdoor furniture, wastewater
treatment, seawater desalination, nuclear engineering, and the
production of
biofuels.<sup id="fnref7:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The low recycling rate and the need for the extraction of additional
elements such as chrome and nickel make higher grades of steel more
energy-intensive to produce. For example, stainless steel production
requires almost 80 GJ per ton, four times more than the production of
plain carbon
steel.<sup id="fnref8:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
The continuous development of higher-grade steels is stimulated by
environmental legislation (such as the use of lighter steel in cars) and
by competition from other materials, mainly aluminum and plastic
composites.<sup id="fnref9:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref7:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
Ironically, the competition with these materials, which consume even
more energy, makes steel less and less sustainable.
</p>
<h2 id="steel-and-renewable-energy">
Steel and renewable energy
</h2>
<p>
The steel industry is heavily dependent on the energy supply, but the
energy supply is also heavily dependent on the steel industry. Almost
10% of the global steel output goes into building and maintaining energy
supply infrastructure. That amount corresponds to the entire steel
output in 1950. A great share of that steel goes to gas and oil
infrastructure.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.
Oil and gas mining, production, and transportation require steel for
offshore drilling platforms, pipelines, refineries, tankers, and storage
tanks. Coal mining depends on steel for cutters, loaders, conveyors,
excavators, and
trucks.<sup id="fnref10:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the planned switch to low-carbon energy sources and the
electrification of heating and transport technologies will not decrease
our dependency on the steel industry – on the contrary. A low-carbon
power grid requires much more steel (and other materials) than an
infrastructure based on fossil fuels. Wind and solar power are very
diffuse power sources compared to fossil fuels. Therefore, it takes much
more materials (and land) to produce the same energy. In jargon, wind
and solar have low “power density” or high “material
intensity.”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
The “steel intensity” of thermal gas and coal power plants is between 50
and 60 tonnes of steel per megawatt of installed
power.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
Hydroelectric power plants have a lower steel intensity, with 20-30
tonnes of steel per
MW.<sup id="fnref11:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>

On the other hand, solar PV requires between 40 and 170 tonnes of steel
per installed
MW.<sup id="fnref3:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>
Although there is little or no steel in the solar panels themselves,
it’s the material of choice for the structures that support them.
</p>
<h2 id="steel-and-wind-power">
Steel and wind power
</h2>
<p>
The most steel-intensive power source – by far – is the modern wind
turbine. The steel intensity of a wind turbine depends on its size. A
single, large wind turbine requires significantly more steel per
megawatt of installed power than two smaller wind
turbines.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
For example, a 3.6 MW wind turbine with a 100-meter tall tower requires
335 tons of steel (83 tons/MW), while a 5 MW wind turbine with a
150-meter tall tower needs 875 tons of steel (175
tons/MW).<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>
The trend is towards taller wind turbines and a higher steel intensity.

wind power plants rely on reinforced concrete for their foundations, but
offshore wind turbines need massive steel structures such as monopiles
and
jackets.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>
The steel intensity for offshore wind turbines is calculated to be
around 450 tonnes per MW for a 5 MW turbine – eight times higher than
the steel intensity of a thermal power
plant.<sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.
As these wind turbines get taller and move into deeper waters, their
steel use further increases.
</p>
<p>
The most popular offshore wind turbine nowadays has a capacity of 7 MW,
while the largest ones have a capacity of 14
MW.<sup id="fnref2:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
If we make a conservative estimate based on the data above (the steel
intensity doubles for every doubling of the power capacity), a 14 MW
offshore wind turbine would require 1,300 tons of steel per MW or 18,200
tonnes in total. Such a wind turbine thus consumes 24 times more steel
than a coal or gas power plant of the same power capacity.
</p>
<h2 id="shorter-life-expectancy">
Shorter life expectancy
</h2>
<p>
The difference between renewable power sources and fossil fuels becomes
even larger if the steel intensity is calculated per unit of energy
rather than power (MWh instead of MW). In contrast to coal and gas power
plants, the output of wind and solar power plants depends on the
weather, and they do not always produce their maximum power capacity.
Therefore, replacing 1 MW of fossil electricity generation capacity
requires the installation of (on average) 4 MW of solar power or 2 MW of
wind
power.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>
A 14 MW offshore wind turbine thus has a steel intensity that is almost
50 times higher than a fossil fuel power plant for every kilowatt-hour
of electricity
produced.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Solar and wind power plants also have shorter lifetimes (20-30 years)
compared to thermal power plants (30-60
years).<sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>
While this does not affect the steel intensity per MW of power
installed, it again increases the steel intensity per unit of energy
produced over time. That does not always lead to a doubling of steel use
because foundations for offshore wind turbines and structures for solar
panels may have longer lifetimes than the power sources they support and
could thus be
reused.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="power-transmission-infrastructure">
Power transmission infrastructure
</h2>
<p>
The data above only include the steel used in the power plants
themselves. For fossil fuel power plants, they do not include the steel
used in the pipelines, oil rigs, coal excavators, and the like. However,
the same goes for the low-carbon power sources. Because they need much
more resources than thermal power plants (steel but also other metals
and materials), they depend on a global mining and transport
infrastructure that is just as steel-intensive as the supply chain for
fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, because they are more diffuse power sources with
intermittent and unpredictable power production, often located far away
from energy consumption centers, renewable power plants drive the
expansion of transmission infrastructure. That infrastructure is also
based on steel – from switchyard equipment over towers to conduction
cables.<sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup><sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Finally, low-carbon power sources also have a high need for special
grades of steel, which are more energy-intensive to produce. Steel for
off-shore wind turbines should resist corrosion, and stainless steel is
increasingly used for solar panel support
structures.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>
Electrical lamination steel (iron-silicon) is indispensable for
transformers in the power
network.<sup id="fnref12:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Nuclear power plants may have a relatively low steel intensity but are
completely built up of energy-intensive specialty steels. For example,
cladding the fuel elements containing fissionable uranium requires
zirconium steel, while all structural elements contain austenitic
stainless
steel.<sup id="fnref13:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>

<p>
The high steel intensity of low carbon power sources confronts us with a
so-called “catch-22”, a situation in which there seems to be no escape
from a problem no matter what we do. We need much more steel if we
replace thermal power plants with renewable ones. Because there is not
enough steel scrap available, we can only produce that extra steel from
iron ore in blast furnaces burning fossil fuels. To address climate
change, we need to build low-carbon sources quickly and in great
numbers. However, to achieve circular material flows and build
low-carbon power sources from scrap and renewable electricity, we would
have to do the opposite: slow down the development of a low-carbon power
grid.

A well-cited study from 2013 concluded that if wind and solar power
would supply 25,000 Twh of electricity – which corresponds to total
global electricity demand in 2021 – we need about 3,200 Mt of steel to
build the power plants
alone.<sup id="fnref4:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>
Global electricity demand is projected to grow to between 52,000 and
71,000 terawatt-hours in 2050, which would increase the extra steel
demand to between 6,400 and 8,960
Mt.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>
Spread out over the lifetime of solar panels and wind turbines (25
years), we would have to produce 256 to 358 Mt extra steel per year to
make wind turbines and solar panel structures – comparable to the steel
demand for passenger cars (195 Mt) and other transportation modes (98
Mt) combined.
</p>
<p>
That is still a very optimistic estimation. Electricity demand only
makes up around 20% of total energy demand. If the total energy demand
(177,000 Twh in 2021) would be supplied by wind and solar, we would need
22,400 Mt of steel. That’s an extra 896 Mt steel per year – as much as
the global production in the early 2000s. You could argue that
electricity can be used more efficiently than fossil fuels, for example,
in cars and heating systems. However, at the same time, total energy
demand is expected to rise further, countering the gains made by
increased energy efficiency.
</p>
<h2 id="the-high-tech-solutions">
The high-tech solutions
</h2>
<p>
The steel industry counts on technological solutions to make steel
production carbon neutral. One option is to replace coal by gas, an
approach that is already common in the Middle East and North America.
Gas-based steelmaking results in somewhat lower carbon emissions, but
they are still much higher than in the case of the electric arc furnace.
Therefore, most attention goes to hydrogen, which can replace purified
coal (coke) as a reducing agent in a direct reduction shaft
furnace.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>
However, hydrogen-based steelmaking does not offer an escape from the
catch-22 because it further increases the need for a steel-intensive
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
The production of hydrogen is energy-intensive. It takes 50-55
kilowatt-hour to make 1 kg of hydrogen and 60 kg of hydrogen to make 1
ton of
steel.<sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>
The production of 1 ton of steel from hydrogen thus consumes 3,000 kWh
of electricity, which is ten times higher than the electricity use of an
electric arc furnace making steel from scrap. Consequently,
hydrogen-based steelmaking requires roughly ten times more wind turbines
and solar panels than scrap-based steel production – and thus ten times
more steel. On top of this comes the steel for building the pipelines
and storage tanks that are part of the hydrogen infrastructure.

<p>
Carbon capture and storage, in which the carbon emissions of steelmaking
plants are captured and then stored underground, faces the same
problems. It requires a steel infrastructure and extra energy, thus
indirectly raising the use of fossil fuels. Reverting to older,
preindustrial steelmaking processes is not the answer either. Today’s
blast furnace is essentially still the blast furnace from earlier
centuries, only much more energy
efficient.<sup id="fnref14:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="the-low-tech-solutions">
The low-tech solutions
</h2>
<p>
The picture painted above seems to offer little hope for carbon-neutral
steelmaking and power production. However, there is a low-tech solution
that could achieve it. We could adjust steel production to the available
scrap supply both in quantity and quality. That would allow us to
produce all steel from scrap in electric arc furnaces, dramatically
reducing energy consumption and eliminating almost all carbon emissions.
Of course, the intent should not be to replace steel with plastic
composites and aluminum because they are even more energy-intensive to
produce. The only solution is to reduce material use overall.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We could adjust steel production to the available scrap supply both in
quantity and quality.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reducing the steel output and using more common steel grades would not
bring us back to the Bronze Age. As noted, global end-of-life ferrous
scrap availability was approximately 450 Mt in 2021, which would allow
us to produce roughly one-quarter of the current steel output.
Furthermore, the scrap supply will continue to rise for the next 40
years, enabling us to produce more and more low-emission steel each
year. By 2050, scrap availability is expected to rise to about 900 Mt,
almost half of today’s global steel
production.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>
All that extra steel could be invested in expanding the low-carbon power
grid without raising emissions first.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of room to reduce the steel intensity of modern society.
All our basic needs – and more – could be supplied with much less steel
involved. For example, we could make cars lighter by making them
smaller. That would bring energy savings without the need for
energy-intensive high-grade steel. We could replace cars with bicycles
and public transportation so that more people share less steel. Such
changes would also reduce the need for steel in the road network, the
energy infrastructure, and the manufacturing industry. We would need
fewer machine tools, shipping containers, and reinforced concrete
buildings. Whenever steel intensity is reduced, the advantages cascade
throughout the whole system. Preventing corrosion and producing steel
more locally from local resources would also reduce energy use and
emissions.<sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The continuous growth of the steel output – the increasing steel
intensity of human society – makes sustainable steel production
impossible. No technology can change that because it’s not a
technological problem. Like forestry can only be sustainable if the wood
demand does not exceed the wood supply, steel is sustainable or not
depending on the balance between (scrap) supply and (steel) demand. We
may not be able to escape the Iron Age, but we have an option to escape
the catch-22 that inextricably links steel production with fossil
fuels.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>

In the West, the expansion of steel use happened over a period of 150
years, in tandem with technological evolution. In contrast, China
compressed this technological evolution in just a few decades: shipping
and railways, electrification, steel buildings, the car and the
airplane, the internet, and renewable power technologies. There are
still large parts of the world where the steel intensity of society is
very low, such as India and Africa. There is thus still a lot of room
for the growth of the steel output. Source: Smil, Vaclav. Still the iron

For off-shore wind turbines, the lifetime of the foundations is
estimated to be 100 years, so in principle they could serve for
replacement wind turbines of the same size. On the other hand, it is not
self-evident that these steel foundations will eventually be recycled.
First, only around 10% of decommissioning costs can be recovered by
recycling the metal, meaning that it is not economically and perhaps
even energetically interesting to do it. Second, in some cass marine
life has flourished around the foundations. The four offshore wind farms
that had been decomissioned in 2019 lasted for 15, 18, 20 and 26 years.

Another motivation for reducing the steel intensity of modern society is
to limit the consequences of geopolitical conflicts. The more steel we
produce for peaceful purposes, the more steel becomes available for war
and destruction. Remarkably, the production of military equipment is
absent from modern steel statistics, and if mentioned, its share is very
low. However, in times of war, steelmaking facilities switch to
producing steel for military purposes. The steel industry can thus be
converted into a weapons industry at any moment, and there is now a lot
more steel production capacity available than there has ever been in
history. <a href="#fnref:49" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

<h2 id="mending-chestertons-fence-open-source-decision-making">Mending
Chesterton’s Fence: Open Source Decision-making</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-18, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
When each line of code is written it is surrounded by a sea of context:
who in the community this is for, what problem we’re trying to solve,
what technical assumptions we’re making, what we already tried but
didn’t work, how much coffee we’ve had today. All of these have an
effect on the software we write.
</p>
<p>
By the time the next person looks at that code, some of that context
will have evaporated. There may be helpful code comments, tests, and
specifications to explain how it should behave. But they don’t explain
the path not taken, and why we didn’t take it. Or those occasions where
the facts changed, so we changed our mind.
</p>
<p>
Some parts of our system are as old as Crossref itself. Whilst our
process still involves coffee, it’s safe to say that most of our working
assumptions have changed, and for good reasons! We have to be very
careful when working with our oldest code. We always consider why it was
written that way, and what might have changed since. We’re always on the
look out for
<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/chestertons-fence" target="_blank">Chesterton’s
Fence</a>!
</p>
<h2 id="leaving-a-trail">
Leaving a Trail
</h2>
<p>
We’re building a new generation of systems at Crossref, and as we go
we’re being deliberate about supporting the people who will maintain it.
</p>
<p>
When our oldest code was written, the software development team all
worked in an office with a whiteboard or three, and the code was
proprietary. Twenty years later, things are very different. The software
development team is spread over 8 timezones. Thanks to
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">POSI</a>,
all the new code we write is open source, so the next people to read
that code might not even be Crossref staff.
</p>
<p>
Working increasingly asynchronously, without that whiteboard, we need to
record the options, collect evidence, and peer-review them within the
team.
</p>
<p>
So for the past couple of years the software team has maintained a
<a href="https://crossref.gitlab.io/engineering/decision-records/" target="_blank">decision
register</a>. The first decision we recorded was that we should record
decisions! Since then we have recorded the significant decisions as they
arise. Plus some
<a href="https://crossref.gitlab.io/engineering/decision-records/dr-0003/" target="_blank">historical
ones</a>.
</p>
<p>
These aren’t functional specifications, which describe what the system
should do. It’s the decisions and trade-offs we made along the way to
get to the how. Look out for another blog post about specifications.
</p>
<p>
By leaving a trail of explanations as we go, we make it easier for
people to understand why code was written, and what has changed. We’re
writing the story of our new systems. This makes it easier to alter the
system in future in response to changes in our community, and the
metadata they use.
</p>
<h2 id="difficult-decisions">
Difficult Decisions
</h2>
<p>
There are some fun challenges to building systems at Crossref. We have a
lot of data. Our schema is very diverse, and has a vast amount of domain
knowledge embedded in it. It’s changed over time to accommodate 20 years
of scholarly publishing innovations. Our community is diverse too, from
small one-person publishers with a handful of articles, through to large
ones that publish millions.
</p>
<p>
What might be an obvious decision for a database table with a thousand
rows doesn’t always translate to a million. When you get to a billion,
things change again. An initially sensible choice might not scale. And a
scalable solution might look over-engineered if we had millions of DOIs,
rather than hundreds of millions.
</p>
<p>
The diversity of the data also poses challenges. A very simple feature
might get complicated or expensive when it meets the heterogeneity of
our metadata and membership. What might scale for journal article or
grant metadata might not work for book chapters.
</p>
<p>
The big decisions need careful discussion, experimentation, and
justification.
</p>
<h2 id="2nf-or-not-2nf">
2NF or not 2NF
</h2>
<p>
One such recent decision was how we structure our SQL schema for the
database that powers our new ‘relationships’ REST API endpoint,
currently in development.
</p>
<p>
The data model is simple: we have a table of Relationships which connect
pairs of Items. And each Item can have properties (such as a type). The
way to model this is straightforward, following conventional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization" target="_blank">normalization
rules</a>:
</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/open-source-decision-making/1.svg"
alt="SQL Tables, normalised" width="100%"/>
</figure>
<p>
We built the API around it, and all was well.
</p>
<p>
We then added a feature which lets you look up relationships based on
the properties of the subject or object. For example “find citations
where the subject is an article and the object is a dataset”. This
design worked well in our initial testing. We loaded more data into it,
and it continued to work well.
</p>
<p>
And then, the context changed. Once we tested loading a billion
relationships in the database, the performance dropped. The
characteristics of the data: size, shape and distribution, reached a
point where the database was unable to run queries in a timely way. The
PostgreSQL query planner became unpredictable and occasionally produced
some quite exciting query plans (to non-technical readers: databases are
neither the time nor the place for excitement).
</p>
<p>
This is a normal experience in scaling up a system. We expected that
something like this would happen at some point, but you don’t know when
it will happen until you try. We bounced around some ideas and came up
with a couple of alternatives. Each made trade-offs around processing
time, data storage and query flexibility. The best way to evaluate them
was to use real data at a representative scale.
</p>
<p>
One of the options was denormalisation. This is a conventional solution
to this kind of problem, but was not our first choice as it involves
extra machinery to keep the data up-to-date, and more storage. It would
not have been the correct solution for a smaller dataset. But we had the
evidence that the other two approaches would not scale predictably.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/open-source-decision-making/2.svg"
alt="SQL Tables, normalised" width="100%"/>
</figure>
<br>
<p>
By combining the data into one table, we can serve up API requests much
more predictably, and with much better performance. This code is now
running with the right performance. Technical readers note that this
diagram is simplified. The
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/manifold/-/blob/62fc458b280e71c6b6221908fb7824bd3573726f/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1_0_0__initial_schema_creation.sql#L356" target="_blank">real
SQL schema</a> is a little different.
</p>
<p>
Without writing this history down, and explaining what we tried, someone
might misunderstand the reason for the code and try to simplify it.
Decision record
<a href="https://crossref.gitlab.io/engineering/decision-records/dr-0500/" target="_blank">DR-0500</a>
guards against that.
</p>
<p>
But one day, when the context changes, future developers will be able to
come back and modify the code, because they understand why it was like
that in the first place.

<h2 id="hackintosh-is-almost-dead">Hackintosh is (almost) dead</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s true that latest macOS 14 (Sonoma) still supports the latest
generations of Intel Macs and it’s very likely that at least one or two
major versions will still be compatible. But there’s one particular
development that is de-facto killing off the Hackintosh scene. In
Sonoma, Apple has completely removed all traces of driver support for
their oldest WiFi/Bt cards, namely various Broadcom cards that they last
used in 2012/13 iMac / MacBook models. Those Mac models are not
supported by macOS for few years now thus it’s not surprising the
drivers are being removed. Most likely reason is that Apple is moving
drivers away from .kext (Kernel Extensions) to .dext (DriverKit) thus
cleaning up obsolete and unused code from macOS. They did the same with
Ethernet drivers in Ventura. ↫ Aleksandar Vacić Everybody, especially
the small but active Hackintosh community itself, knew full well the
writing was on the wall the day Apple switched to ARM, and we’re seeing
the first signs of the impending end of the community. Sure, enough
people will remain who are interested in building Hackintoshes using
older, unsupported versions of macOS, kind of like retrocomputing, but
the days of running the latest macOS release on non-Apple hardware are
coming to an end. As a fun side note, this old OSNews article I wrote in
2009 is one of the most-visited articles on our site of all time.
Hackintoshes were way, way more popular than people gave them credit
for.</p>

adds “real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection” to Chrome</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>For more than 15 years, Google Safe Browsing has been protecting
users from phishing, malware, unwanted software and more, by identifying
and warning users about potentially abusive sites on more than 5 billion
devices around the world. As attackers grow more sophisticated, we’ve
seen the need for protections that can adapt as quickly as the threats
they defend against. That’s why we’re excited to announce a new version
of Safe Browsing that will provide real-time, privacy-preserving URL
protection for people using the Standard protection mode of Safe
Browsing in Chrome. ↫ Jasika Bawa, Xinghui Lu, Jonathan Li, and Alex
Wozniak on the Google blog Reading through the description of how this
new feature works, it does indeed seem to respect one’s privacy, but
there could be so many devils in so many details here that you’d really
need to be a specialist in these matters to truly gauge if Google isn’t
getting its hands on the URLs you visit through this feature. But even
if all that is true, it doesn’t really matter because Google has tons of
other ways to collect more than enough data on you to build an exact
profile of you are, and what advertisements will work well no you. Any
time Google goes out of its way to announce it’s not collecting some
type of data – like here, the URLs you type into the Chrome URL bar –
it’s not because they care so much about your privacy, but because they
simply don’t need this data to begin with.</p>

so funny, the editor of Wordle on a
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/1000-wordles-later/">podcast</a> on
Friday, 1000th puzzle day, said there are some puzzles that you might
not solve in six moves not because of skill rather because of luck. I
was pretty sure when I took my second guess, but that’s just when the
cursing started. By the third guess I thought she’s screwing with us! I
should not have listened to the podcast.</p>

me</a> to imagine the future of software documentation. What will
software technical writing look like in, say, 2049, when our profession
will be a century old? Will we be writing markup in git repositories or
use ÜberDITA in space? Will our job still exist? I’ve put my futurist
hat on to picture the shape of our profession 25 years from now. Buckle
up!

<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>People in the United Kingdom who use RISC OS have plenty of
opportunities to meet up with fellow users, with a number of user groups
holding meetings on a regular basis, and a small number of main events –
the shows, such as Wakefield and London. But what of our European
friends? It’s possible for them to join some of the user group meetings
when they’re held online and at a suitable time, as many are, but while
doing so is an opportunity not to be missed where possible it’s…</p>

Ladybird with tools from Google Project Zero</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>While Ladybird does an okay job with well-formed web content, I
thought it would be useful to throw some security research tools at it
and see what kind of issues it might reveal. So today we’ll be using
“Domato”, a DOM fuzzer from Google Project Zero, to stress test Ladybird
and fix some issues found along the way. The way this works is that
Domato generates randomized web pages with lots of mostly-valid but
strange HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I then load these pages into a debug
build of Ladybird and observe what happens. ↫ Andreas Kling I have high
hopes for Ladybird.</p>

<h2 id="wal-g-3.0.0-released">WAL-G 3.0.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
WAL-G team is happy to announce the release of WAL-G 3.0.0
</p>
<p>
WAL-G is a tool for archival database restoration for PostgreSQL,
GreenplumDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, etcd and several other databases.
</p>
<h2>
Noteworthy Changes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Every database engine can now benefit from failover storage. This
technique can save the day if one of the storage systems goes down.
However, do not forget to monitor them anyway.
</li>
<li>
For Postgres, we have a WAL archiving daemon available. Its primary
purpose is to improve the efficiency of parallel archiving.
</li>
<li>
Additionally, WAL-G supports the partial restoration of a cluster. If
you have large, unnecessary tables, you can exclude them from the
restoration process, the Postgres will skip over the WAL records for
these tables. See
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/PostgreSQL.md#partial-restore-experimental">docs</a>
for details.
</li>
<li>
Greenplum’s PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) is undergoing its maturation
process. Partial restore is supported in a similar way to Postgres. We
now have tools to verify the integrity of AOfiles in storage without
actually restoring backups.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
WAL-G v3.0.0 is available for download on our
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases">GitHub releases
page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Have a nice day!
