URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 102
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
955 AM CDT Wed Apr 10 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 955 AM
  until 500 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Widespread damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible

SUMMARY...Conditions will become increasingly favorable for severe
storms as tornadoes as additional moistening and destabilization
occurs, with storms increasing ahead of a squall line, potentially
leading to multiple rounds of severe storms in some areas through
mid into late afternoon.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 85 statute miles
north and south of a line from 35 miles north northwest of Mobile AL
to 35 miles east of Evergreen AL. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 101...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 70 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24040.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 101
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
600 AM CDT Wed Apr 10 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Louisiana
  Central and Southern Mississippi
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 600 AM
  until 100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A destabilizing airmass across the central Gulf Coast will
support an increasing severe thunderstorm and tornado risk this
morning into the midday.  The tornado risk will likely maximize with
any supercells that develop within the warm sector as the marine
warm front advances northward.  A squall line will move west to east
across the area with a risk for damaging gusts and the tornado risk
will likely focus with any sustained mesovortex or embedded
supercell.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 85 statute miles
east and west of a line from 95 miles northwest of Meridian MS to 45
miles west southwest of Boothville LA. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0742 AM CDT Wed Apr 10 2024

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA INTO SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND SOUTHWEST
ALABAMA...

...SUMMARY...
Numerous severe thunderstorms are forecast across parts of the
central Gulf Coast States.  The potential will exist for several
tornadoes, a few of which may be strong, and widespread damaging
winds.

...Central Gulf Coast States...
Morning water-vapor imagery shows a well-defined upper low over west
TX.  This feature will eject east-northeast into the mid-South,
eventually opening up late in the period as a northern-stream
short-wave trough digs into the upper MS Valley.  A 70-80kt 500-mb
speed max will quickly move from the TX coast into the lower MS
Valley and over AL late tonight.  In the low levels, a maritime warm
front will gradually advance inland over the coastal plain aided in
part by a 50+ kt southerly LLJ.  Strong upper forcing for ascent
moving across the Gulf Coast will continue to promote widespread
showers/thunderstorms advancing west to east during the period.  

A severe squall line over southwest LA this morning will likely
intensify through the morning as tropospheric flow strengthens
across LA into MS.  A reservoir of rich moisture located over
southern LA and far southern MS is contributing to moderate buoyancy
(1200 J/kg MLCAPE per the 12z Slidell, LA raob).  Weaker buoyancy
and lower dewpoints (lower 60s deg F) farther north (reference the
nil buoyancy on the 12z BMX raob) across east-central MS into the
northern half of AL will likely serve as a an area where lower
severe coverage and storm intensity is expected.  In the area across
south-central MS east into southwest AL and southward to the coast,
the airmass will likely support both a mix of supercells ahead of
the squall line and bowing segments with the evolving bow. 
Widespread damaging winds should accompany this linear band of
storms. As the boundary layer warms, quasi-discrete supercells
interacting with enhanced SRH within the warm frontal zone will
potentially be capable of a few tornadoes, one or more of which may
be strong.  For short-term details concerning the severe threat
through mid morning across LA, refer to MCD #412.  As this activity
spreads east during the afternoon, at least weak destabilization is
forecast across AL into the FL Panhandle.  An environment supporting
severe gusts and the potential for tornadoes will likely develop.  A
gradual lessening in storm intensity and severe coverage is expected
overnight, but an organized severe threat will probably remain along
the northeast Gulf Coast.

Mesoscale Discussion 0395
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0848 AM CDT Tue Apr 09 2024

Areas affected...Portions of central/east TX into northwestern LA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 091348Z - 091545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A watch may be needed as the threat for tornadoes, large
hail, and damaging winds gradually increases this morning.

DISCUSSION...Warm advection associated with a 35-45 kt southerly
low-level jet, along with ascent attendant to the left exit region
of a southwesterly mid/upper-level jet, is aiding convection across
parts of central/east TX into northwestern LA. Some of this activity
across central TX is occurring near a convectively reinforced
outflow boundary, with a rich low-level airmass present along/south
of this boundary. Steep mid-level lapse rates are supporting
1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE in central TX, even though daytime heating
remains muted thus far, with lesser instability into east TX and
northwestern LA. Still, strong deep-layer shear of 50+ kt will
foster updraft organization and supercell potential. Large to very
large hail will be a concern with these supercells as they spread
east-northeastward this morning. An increasing potential for
severe/damaging winds may be realized if a cluster forms along the
outflow boundary/front. Sufficient low-level shear is also present
for low-level updraft rotation and some tornado threat. Watch
issuance may be needed if convection continues to increase in
coverage and intensity across central TX.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 94
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
940 AM CDT Tue Apr 9 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 940 AM until
  500 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Several thunderstorm clusters, including a mix of
supercells and bowing line segments, are expected along a stalled
front across central Texas through the afternoon.  More isolated
supercell development will be possible later this morning into early
this afternoon into the I-35 corridor closer to Austin.  The storm
environment will support the potential for large hail up to 2.5
inches in diameter, damaging gusts of 60-70 mph, and potentially a
few tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 40 statute miles

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0109 AM CDT Tue Apr 09 2024

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level jet streak will align with northwesterly
low-level flow in the wake of a surface low across Texas on
Wednesday. This will result in very strong northwesterly flow across
much of Texas with sustained winds up to 30 mph expected near the
Red River and into southern Texas, beneath the strongest mid-level
flow. In this same region, relative humidity of 20 to 25 percent is
expected. These conditions will combine for critical meteorological
fire weather conditions. However, have only added an Elevated
delineation, as fuel status remains questionable across portions of
southern Texas. Fuels greened up across this region earlier this
spring, but there has been minimal precipitation over the past 2
weeks. An additional complicating factor is the potential for
wetting rain on Day 1 (Tuesday/Tuesday night) which would
significantly impact fuel receptiveness across some portions of the
area. Therefore, an Elevated delineation seems warranted at this
time.
