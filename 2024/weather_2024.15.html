Mesoscale Discussion 0395
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0848 AM CDT Tue Apr 09 2024

Areas affected...Portions of central/east TX into northwestern LA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 091348Z - 091545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A watch may be needed as the threat for tornadoes, large
hail, and damaging winds gradually increases this morning.

DISCUSSION...Warm advection associated with a 35-45 kt southerly
low-level jet, along with ascent attendant to the left exit region
of a southwesterly mid/upper-level jet, is aiding convection across
parts of central/east TX into northwestern LA. Some of this activity
across central TX is occurring near a convectively reinforced
outflow boundary, with a rich low-level airmass present along/south
of this boundary. Steep mid-level lapse rates are supporting
1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE in central TX, even though daytime heating
remains muted thus far, with lesser instability into east TX and
northwestern LA. Still, strong deep-layer shear of 50+ kt will
foster updraft organization and supercell potential. Large to very
large hail will be a concern with these supercells as they spread
east-northeastward this morning. An increasing potential for
severe/damaging winds may be realized if a cluster forms along the
outflow boundary/front. Sufficient low-level shear is also present
for low-level updraft rotation and some tornado threat. Watch
issuance may be needed if convection continues to increase in
coverage and intensity across central TX.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 94
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
940 AM CDT Tue Apr 9 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 940 AM until
  500 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Several thunderstorm clusters, including a mix of
supercells and bowing line segments, are expected along a stalled
front across central Texas through the afternoon.  More isolated
supercell development will be possible later this morning into early
this afternoon into the I-35 corridor closer to Austin.  The storm
environment will support the potential for large hail up to 2.5
inches in diameter, damaging gusts of 60-70 mph, and potentially a
few tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 40 statute miles
north and south of a line from 50 miles west of Austin TX to 140
miles east northeast of Temple TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 25025.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0720 AM CDT Tue Apr 09 2024

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR CENTRAL
INTO EAST TEXAS AND WESTERN LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely today across much of Texas
into the lower Mississippi River Valley.  Several tornadoes, a
couple of which may be strong, large to very large hail, and severe
gusts are forecast.

...Synopsis...
A mid- to upper-level low evident in water-vapor imagery near the
NM/AZ/Mexico border this morning, will move east into northwest TX
by daybreak Wednesday.  Early morning analysis indicates an
outflow-reinforced effective frontal zone is draped east to west
from western LA into central TX, with the western portion of the
boundary intersecting a surface low over the Permian Basin this
morning.  This surface low will gradually develop eastward into the
TX Hill Country by early evening as the mid- to upper-level
trough/low encroaches on the southern Great Plains.  Little overall
northward advancement is forecast in the outflow/effective frontal
zone across central TX eastward into north-central LA during the
period.  

...TX to Lower MS Valley...
A multi-scenario severe thunderstorm outlook is lending considerable
uncertainty to this forecast.  Strong to locally severe
thunderstorms may continue to develop and increase in coverage over
northwest/west TX this morning as the leading edge of stronger upper
forcing for ascent overspreads a capped but moist/unstable airmass
near/north of the frontal zone (reference 12z Midland raob).  As an
80-kt 500mb speed max translates through the base of the upper
trough, additional storm development will likely occur in a
moist/warm conveyor across portions of central TX eastward into
western LA.  Models maintain the LLJ across east TX into southern AR
most of the period.  As a result, episodic bouts of deep convection
should be noted across this region.  Strong boundary-layer heating
on the southwestern periphery of active convective clusters (most
likely to occur over east-central TX and locales farther east) will
yield a very unstable airmass by mid afternoon.  The presence of
surface dewpoints near 70 deg F beneath steep 700-500 mb lapse rates
will yield large buoyancy, and the risk for large to very large hail
with the stronger updrafts.  Large low-level hodographs (200-300
m2/s2 0-1 km SRH) in the warm frontal zone will act to enhance both
supercell development and a tornado risk with any supercells that
can develop and move into this moist/strong low-level shear
corridor.  During the evening, large-scale height falls will spread
east and it seems increasingly probable a squall line will develop. 
A few tornadoes and 60-80 mph gusts are possible with this potential
linear MCS.

...Lower Great Lakes...
Southern influence of a strong short-wave trough will glance
northern OH into western NY. Boundary-layer heating is expected to
contribute to modest instability by mid afternoon as surface
temperatures warm through the mid 60s to near 70F. Ample deep-layer
shear will exist for a few robust storms capable of generating gusty
winds and perhaps isolated severe hail. Greatest risk will be with
convection that develops along the front as it eases southeast into
this region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0109 AM CDT Tue Apr 09 2024

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level jet streak will align with northwesterly
low-level flow in the wake of a surface low across Texas on
Wednesday. This will result in very strong northwesterly flow across
much of Texas with sustained winds up to 30 mph expected near the
Red River and into southern Texas, beneath the strongest mid-level
flow. In this same region, relative humidity of 20 to 25 percent is
expected. These conditions will combine for critical meteorological
fire weather conditions. However, have only added an Elevated
delineation, as fuel status remains questionable across portions of
southern Texas. Fuels greened up across this region earlier this
spring, but there has been minimal precipitation over the past 2
weeks. An additional complicating factor is the potential for
wetting rain on Day 1 (Tuesday/Tuesday night) which would
significantly impact fuel receptiveness across some portions of the
area. Therefore, an Elevated delineation seems warranted at this
time.
