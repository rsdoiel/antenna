Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0653 AM CST Tue Mar 05 2024

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE
ARKLATEX TO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...AND PARTS OF PENINSULAR
FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to marginally severe thunderstorms are possible today over
the region from the Arklatex to the lower Mississippi Valley, then
mainly tonight over parts of peninsular Florida.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a low-amplitude, zonal to gently cyclonic flow
pattern is present over most of the CONUS, ahead of a synoptic
trough over the northeastern Pacific between 130W-140W.  That trough
will approach coastal northern/central CA near the end of the period
with an embedded 500-mb low west of MRY, then move inland on day 2. 
Downstream, a southern-stream shortwave trough -- with several
associated/small-scale vorticity maxima -- was apparent in
moisture-channel imagery over eastern parts of OK/TX to the
mid/upper TX Coast.  This feature is expected to shift eastward
across the Gulf Coast States and northern Gulf through the period,
reaching parts of MS/AL and the FL Panhandle by 00Z, then moving
across GA/FL in piecemeal fashion around the end of the period and
early day 2.  A weaker perturbation -- initially evident over parts
of the Mid-Atlantic region and adjoining ocean waters -- should
deamplify as it moves northeastward across New England through
tonight.

At the surface, a cold front was analyzed at 11Z from western QC
across Lake Huron to southern MO, southeastern OK, north-central TX,
and the TX South Plains region.  A weak, attached low initially east
of DAL should drift southward with the boundary and weaken further
today, while another frontal-wave low forms ahead of the front over
northern AL overnight.  The front itself should move slowly
southward across central/east TX, AR, and the lower Ohio Valley
through the period.

...Arklatex to lower Mississippi Valley/Delta regions...
The threat for marginally severe hail is ongoing with widely
scattered elevated thunderstorms ongoing over portions of AR into
the Arklatex region and nearby LA/east TX.  Though predominantly
multicellular in character, due to lack of more intense vertical
shear, MUCAPE in the 1000-2000 J/kg range, supported by patches of
favorable low-level moisture away from convectively modified air
masses, should continue to support episodic development generally
shifting eastward to east-southeastward across the outlook area into
this afternoon.

Sporadic large hail on a pulse basis will remain a threat, though
isolated damaging to severe gusts cannot be ruled out as well. 
Several clusters or small complexes of thunderstorms may develop as
the morning activity moves toward the lower Mississippi Valley, with
the messier mode lessening hail potential locally but maintaining
some pulse-wind threat.  Strongest mid/upper winds also will be
displaced over the Great Lakes and northern Gulf in distinct
northern and subtropical streams -- north and south of the greatest
concentrations of convection.  This should maintain modest deep
shear and a mostly multicell mode for inland activity.

Though the prefrontal boundary layer should destabilize diurnally, 
especially over western parts of the outlook area ahead of the cold
front -- mid/upper forcing for ascent will be displaced farther east
into the Delta region with time -- and ultimately over parts of the
Southeast containing less-suitable low-level moisture and
instability.  Though isolated strong-severe afternoon thunderstorms
may form closer to the front in east TX, AR and LA, large-scale
subsidence behind the trough will foster stable layers that may
inhibit sustained convection over the greatest low-level instability
today.  With associated coverage uncertainties, overall
unconditional severe probabilities are kept at marginal levels for
the time being.

...FL...
As the large-scale ascent/destabilization passes over the north-
central/northeastern Gulf waters -- including the Loop Current --
low/middle-level lapse rates should steepen with weakening MLCINH. 
This may support upscale organization of convection now near and off
the northern coastline into a quasi-linear MCS that would move
east-southeastward across the Gulf, reaching the West Coast of FL
late this evening or overnight, before shifting eastward over at
least parts of the peninsula.  Additional convection may form late
during the diurnal heating cycle this afternoon, and/or in a zone of
increasing warm advection and low-level convergence/lift ahead of
the MCS this evening.

While both synoptic and convection-allowing guidance is inconsistent
on mesoscale timing of the complex, or greatest coverage areas of
pre-MCS activity, the general notion of increasing convective
potential from late afternoon onward over FL is supported by the
pattern and by ongoing offshore convective trends.  As such, while
the severe threat still looks conditional (especially given some
nocturnal stabilization likely to occur inland over FL), at least a
marginal unconditional risk now is apparent, given increasing deep
shear progged across most of the area, and at least marginal
low-level instability with around 500-1500 J/kg MLCAPE away from
convective outflows.  Progged hodographs generally are not
particularly large, though storm-scale and boundary interactions can
modify them locally to become more favorable, amidst 35-45-kt
effective-shear magnitudes.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0352 AM CST Tue Mar 05 2024

Valid 081200Z - 131200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Enhanced mid/upper-level flow associated with an upper trough will
overspread much of the southern Plains into the lower MS Valley and
central Gulf Coast States on Day 4/Friday. Thunderstorms should be
ongoing Friday morning across parts of central/east TX. Strong
deep-layer shear should continue to support updraft organization,
with enough MUCAPE present for robust convection. The severe threat
on Friday should shift from TX into the lower MS Valley in tandem
with a northward-developing warm sector and low-level moisture
return. Latest guidance has trended slightly later with the upper
trough ejection, and depicts a somewhat weaker surface low.
Accordingly, it appears that the rich low-level moisture may not
advance as far northward as indicated previously across the central
Gulf Coast States. Have therefore trimmed the northern extent of the
15% severe area for Friday across central MS/AL. There will still be
a severe risk for areas closer to the coast, where a favorable
thermodynamic and kinematic environment should support a threat for
tornadoes, damaging winds, and hail with surface-based convection
through Friday night.

The upper trough and related mid/upper-level jet should continue
moving eastward across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions on Day
5/Saturday. Some severe threat should persist across these areas
through Saturday night. However, there may be a tendency for
convection to outpace the low-level moisture return and gradually
become more elevated with eastward extent across the Southeast.
Still, parts of southern AL into the FL Panhandle/north FL and
GA/SC/NC will be closely monitored for possible inclusion in a 15%
severe area if confidence increases that sufficient instability will
exist to support surface-based thunderstorms and a corresponding
risk for tornadoes and damaging winds. Once the surface cold front
associated with the upper cyclone clears the East Coast on Day
6/Sunday, severe potential should remain minimal across the CONUS
through early next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 AM CST Tue Mar 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
A northern-stream midlevel shortwave trough will cross the northern
Plains during the afternoon, while a related surface cyclone tracks
northeastward from SD across northwestern MN. Along/east of the
surface cyclone, a tightening pressure gradient, coupled with
shallow boundary-layer mixing into a southerly low-level jet, will
yield 20-25 mph sustained southerly surface winds (with gusts
upwards of 45 mph) across portions of northeastern NE, eastern SD,
far northwest IA, and western MN. While RH reductions will be
limited, owing to slightly cool surface temperatures (especially
with northward extent), high-resolution ensemble guidance suggests
that 25-30 percent minimum RH is possible. As a result, an elevated
wind-driven fire-weather risk is expected, given modestly receptive
fuels across the region.

Farther south, midlevel west-southwesterly flow will strengthen
across the southern Rockies -- ahead of midlevel trough/low 
moving ashore over southern CA. In response, weak lee cyclogenesis
is expected over eastern CO, favoring 15-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds (with higher gusts) across the southern
High Plains. Here, downslope warming/drying will contribute to 15
percent minimum RH, leading to elevated/locally critical
fire-weather conditions during the afternoon.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1147 PM CST Sun Mar 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
Moderate west-southwesterly midlevel flow will persist across the
southern High Plains -- along the southern periphery of the primary
mid/upper-level jet extending across the central Rockies and
adjacent Plains. Related downslope flow off the southern Rockies
will result in 15-20 percent minimum RH across the southern High
Plains, where a modest surface pressure gradient will yield 15-20
mph sustained westerly surface winds. Given dry/receptive fuels
across the area, low-end elevated fire-weather conditions are
expected across parts of eastern NM into West TX. 

Farther north, a broad/weak elongated surface low will drift slowly
northeastward from the central/southern Plains into the Midwest. On
the backside of this feature, locally dry/breezy post-frontal
conditions could support a brief period of elevated fire-weather
conditions across parts of KS, where fuels have become increasingly
dry. However, these conditions appear too brief/localized for an
Elevated area at this time.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD OVER A LARGE AREA FROM EAST TEXAS INTO MOST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will be possible this
afternoon into tonight from parts of central Texas into the lower
Mississippi Valley, as well as from the Ozarks into the Midwest.
Large hail is expected to be the main threat, but strong/gusty winds
and even a tornado may also occur.

...East TX/LA/Western MS Today...
Moderately strong southern-stream mid-level flow is present today
across the southern states, with several weak perturbations
affecting the area.  A warm and moist surface air mass is in place
across east TX into LA, where dewpoints in the upper 60s and 70s
will yield afternoon MLCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg.  Weak low-level warm
advection is expected to result in increasing thunderstorm
development this morning through the afternoon as storms spread
eastward toward southwest MS.  Deep-layer shear is sufficient for at
least transient supercell structures, but relatively weak low-level
winds suggest the main threats will be hail and gusty winds with the
strongest cells.

...Eastern IA/Northern MO/Northern IL...
A strong surface cold front is sagging southeastward across IA this
morning into a marginally moist and unstable air mass.  All 12z
model guidance agrees on the development of showers and
thunderstorms along the front by early afternoon, although many
solutions suggest most of the activity will be behind the front and
slightly elevated.  Nevertheless, cool temperatures aloft and steep
mid-level lapse rates will promote hail in the stronger cores. 
Storms that can form and persist ahead of the front would have some
marginal concern for gusty winds and perhaps a brief tornado as
well.

...Eastern OK into Mid MS Valley...
Morning model guidance is quite diverse in the development of
thunderstorms across this region, with low confidence in any
particular area.  Will maintain the ongoing MRGL area as a
conditional risk if storms can form - mainly due to unseasonably
warm and moist conditions and sufficient CAPE for some risk of hail.
 However, considerably uncertainty exists.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are unlikely for the remainder of tonight.

...Northern WI into Upper MI...
Thunderstorms are ongoing early this evening across northwest WI,
along and ahead of a cold front attendant to a deep surface cyclone
centered near the ND/MN/MB border. Strong ascent in combination with
steep low/midlevel lapse rates across the region has compensated for
generally limited low-level moisture, though buoyancy remains weak,
with MUCAPE generally less than 500 J/kg. Small hail and gusty winds
will remain possible with these storms as they move across northern
WI into Upper MI and over Lake Superior through the evening. See MCD
187 for more information. 

...Florida...
A downward trend in storm coverage/intensity has been noted over
Florida this evening, though an ongoing storm cluster west of Lake
Okeechobee could pose a threat for small hail and gusty winds for as
long as it persists. Substantial earlier convective overturning over
much of the Peninsula and the loss of diurnal heating should
contribute to a continued overall weakening trend with time tonight.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CST Sun Mar 03 2024

Valid 051200Z - 111200Z

A relatively zonal upper pattern will encourage locally dry and
windy conditions across the Plains states Tuesday-Wednesday, before
dry and windy conditions increase across the southern High Plains
later this week in advance of an approaching mid-level trough.
Medium range guidance members show some potential for Critical
overlapping winds/RH somewhere from the Texas/New Mexico border to
the Rio Grande during the Thursday-Saturday period. However, the
medium range members vary too much in placement and timing of the
aforementioned Critical winds/RH for Critical probabilities to be
introduced at this time. Nonetheless, prolonged dry conditions are
expected to continue through the week across the southern High
Plains, with no appreciable precipitation accumulations expected. As
such, Critical probabilities or fire weather highlights will likely
be introduced at some point later this week across the southern High
Plains once guidance members show better agreement in the placement
and timing of conditions favorable for wildfire spread.
