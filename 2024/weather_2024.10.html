Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1002 AM CST Mon Mar 04 2024

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with no changes
or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 03/04/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1147 PM CST Sun Mar 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
Moderate west-southwesterly midlevel flow will persist across the
southern High Plains -- along the southern periphery of the primary
mid/upper-level jet extending across the central Rockies and
adjacent Plains. Related downslope flow off the southern Rockies
will result in 15-20 percent minimum RH across the southern High
Plains, where a modest surface pressure gradient will yield 15-20
mph sustained westerly surface winds. Given dry/receptive fuels
across the area, low-end elevated fire-weather conditions are
expected across parts of eastern NM into West TX. 

Farther north, a broad/weak elongated surface low will drift slowly
northeastward from the central/southern Plains into the Midwest. On
the backside of this feature, locally dry/breezy post-frontal
conditions could support a brief period of elevated fire-weather
conditions across parts of KS, where fuels have become increasingly
dry. However, these conditions appear too brief/localized for an
Elevated area at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1000 AM CST Mon Mar 04 2024

Valid 041630Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD OVER A LARGE AREA FROM EAST TEXAS INTO MOST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will be possible this
afternoon into tonight from parts of central Texas into the lower
Mississippi Valley, as well as from the Ozarks into the Midwest.
Large hail is expected to be the main threat, but strong/gusty winds
and even a tornado may also occur.

...East TX/LA/Western MS Today...
Moderately strong southern-stream mid-level flow is present today
across the southern states, with several weak perturbations
affecting the area.  A warm and moist surface air mass is in place
across east TX into LA, where dewpoints in the upper 60s and 70s
will yield afternoon MLCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg.  Weak low-level warm
advection is expected to result in increasing thunderstorm
development this morning through the afternoon as storms spread
eastward toward southwest MS.  Deep-layer shear is sufficient for at
least transient supercell structures, but relatively weak low-level
winds suggest the main threats will be hail and gusty winds with the
strongest cells.

...Eastern IA/Northern MO/Northern IL...
A strong surface cold front is sagging southeastward across IA this
morning into a marginally moist and unstable air mass.  All 12z
model guidance agrees on the development of showers and
thunderstorms along the front by early afternoon, although many
solutions suggest most of the activity will be behind the front and
slightly elevated.  Nevertheless, cool temperatures aloft and steep
mid-level lapse rates will promote hail in the stronger cores. 
Storms that can form and persist ahead of the front would have some
marginal concern for gusty winds and perhaps a brief tornado as
well.

...Eastern OK into Mid MS Valley...
Morning model guidance is quite diverse in the development of
thunderstorms across this region, with low confidence in any
particular area.  Will maintain the ongoing MRGL area as a
conditional risk if storms can form - mainly due to unseasonably
warm and moist conditions and sufficient CAPE for some risk of hail.
 However, considerably uncertainty exists.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE
SOUTHERN UPPER GREAT LAKES REGION SOUTHWESTWARD TO TEXAS...AND INTO
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AREA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will be possible this
afternoon into tonight from parts of central Texas into the lower
Mississippi Valley, as well as from the Ozarks into the Midwest.
Large hail is expected to be the main threat, but strong/gusty winds
and even a tornado may also occur.

...Synopsis...
A broad area of cyclonic flow aloft will remain in place over the
western two-thirds of the country, and is expected to gradually
expand eastward with time.  

As the upper troughing expands, a surface baroclinic zone extending
from the Texas Panhandle to the Upper Great Lakes will gradually
shift southeastward as a cold front, particularly during the second
half of the period.  Along and ahead of this boundary, convection --
and isolated severe weather -- is expected to evolve.

...Southern Upper Great Lakes vicinity southwestward to Texas...
While weak capping should prevail across the southern Plains today,
mixing in the vicinity of a weak dryline over central Texas could
allow an isolated storm or two to develop, and possibly persist into
the evening.  Given steep lapse rates aloft and deep mixed layer,
hail and/or wind exceeding severe levels could occur, in this highly
conditional scenario.

More likely development of showers and thunderstorms is expected
along the surface baroclinic zone that extends northward into the
Upper Great Lakes region, perhaps beginning late this afternoon
across northern portions of the risk area and then expanding
southward along the cold front with time.  With moderately strong
flow aloft atop the frontal zone across northern portions of the
risk area, a couple of stronger/rotating storms may evolve.  Though
hail is expected to be the main risk given steep mid-level lapse
rates, a locally strong gust or two, or brief tornado, would also be
possible if a sustained, rotating storm can develop.

As storms develop south-southwestward into the evening and
overnight, into a region of weaker shear but steep lapse rates,
potential for hail with a few of the strongest storms is expected. 
At this time, any focused areas for greater severe potential remain
difficult to discern, and thus will maintain the broad MRGL risk
area this forecast.

...Lower Mississippi Valley vicinity...
Weak QG ascent is forecast to spread into Louisiana and adjacent
Mississippi this afternoon and into this evening, as somewhat
ill-defined/weak cyclonic disturbances in the southern-stream flow
move across northern Mexico and Texas this morning, and begin
affecting the Lower Mississippi Valley area.  A gradual increase in
convection through the afternoon is expected, as weak
destabilization of the moist boundary layer occurs.  Some increase
in mid-level west-southwesterly flow with time will occur across
this area, as the upper disturbance(s) approach, providing ample
shear for a few stronger storms to potentially evolve.  Hail would
likely remain the primary severe risk with one or two of the
strongest storms, though a stronger wind gust or even a brief
tornado cannot be ruled out given weakly veering flow with height,
and the moist boundary layer supporting surface-based updrafts.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are unlikely for the remainder of tonight.

...Northern WI into Upper MI...
Thunderstorms are ongoing early this evening across northwest WI,
along and ahead of a cold front attendant to a deep surface cyclone
centered near the ND/MN/MB border. Strong ascent in combination with
steep low/midlevel lapse rates across the region has compensated for
generally limited low-level moisture, though buoyancy remains weak,
with MUCAPE generally less than 500 J/kg. Small hail and gusty winds
will remain possible with these storms as they move across northern
WI into Upper MI and over Lake Superior through the evening. See MCD
187 for more information. 

...Florida...
A downward trend in storm coverage/intensity has been noted over
Florida this evening, though an ongoing storm cluster west of Lake
Okeechobee could pose a threat for small hail and gusty winds for as
long as it persists. Substantial earlier convective overturning over
much of the Peninsula and the loss of diurnal heating should
contribute to a continued overall weakening trend with time tonight.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CST Sun Mar 03 2024

Valid 051200Z - 111200Z

A relatively zonal upper pattern will encourage locally dry and
windy conditions across the Plains states Tuesday-Wednesday, before
dry and windy conditions increase across the southern High Plains
later this week in advance of an approaching mid-level trough.
Medium range guidance members show some potential for Critical
overlapping winds/RH somewhere from the Texas/New Mexico border to
the Rio Grande during the Thursday-Saturday period. However, the
medium range members vary too much in placement and timing of the
aforementioned Critical winds/RH for Critical probabilities to be
introduced at this time. Nonetheless, prolonged dry conditions are
expected to continue through the week across the southern High
Plains, with no appreciable precipitation accumulations expected. As
such, Critical probabilities or fire weather highlights will likely
be introduced at some point later this week across the southern High
Plains once guidance members show better agreement in the placement
and timing of conditions favorable for wildfire spread.
