Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1020 AM CST Wed Mar 06 2024

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

The previous forecast remains largely on track. The only appreciable
change made to the Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook was to expand Elevated
highlights eastward into central Minnesota and northern Iowa. Here,
the latest guidance consensus shows 25-30 percent RH coinciding with
15-20 mph sustained southerly surface winds for at least a few hours
this afternoon.

..Squitieri.. 03/06/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CST Wed Mar 06 2024/

...Synopsis...
A northern-stream midlevel shortwave trough will track eastward
across the northern Plains, while an attendant surface cyclone and
trailing cold front move east-northeastward across the Dakotas early
in the period. Along/ahead of the front, a tightening surface
pressure gradient, coupled with boundary-layer mixing into a 45-50
kt low-level jet, will yield 20-25 mph sustained southerly surface
winds (with gusts upwards of 45 mph) across parts of eastern SD,
western MN, northeast NE, and far northwest IA. Here, 25-35 percent
minimum RH will support an elevated to near-critical fire-weather
risk, given the strong/gusty surface winds atop modestly receptive
fuels.

Farther south, midlevel westerly flow will strengthen across the
southern Rockies -- ahead of an approaching midlevel trough/low
moving ashore over southern CA. The strengthening downslope flow off
the southern Rockies, and related lee cyclogenesis over eastern CO,
will favor 15-20 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds (with
higher gusts) amid 15-20 percent afternoon RH across the southern
High Plains. As a result, elevated to spotty critical fire-weather
conditions are expected.

Valid 061630Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...SOUTH CAROLINA...AND PARTS OF WEST-CENTRAL
TO NORTH TEXAS....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon over parts
of the Florida Peninsula and South Carolina, and late afternoon into
tonight over parts of west-central to north Texas.

...FL...
A warm/moist air mass is present across the central/southeast
portions of the FL Peninsula today, where pockets of daytime heating
will yield afternoon moderate MLCAPE values around 2000 J/kg.  At
least isolated thunderstorms are expected to form across this area
during the afternoon, tracking slowly eastward toward the coast. 
Forecast soundings suggest low/deep layer shear is not particularly
strong, but given the favorable thermodynamics, a few strong to
briefly severe storms capable of hail and damaging winds will be
possible - especially near the east coast.  The severe threat should
diminish after sunset.

...SC...
Multiple weak shortwave troughs are rotating across the Carolinas
today.  One feature is currently over western GA, accompanied by a
cluster of showers.  This activity will move into SC this afternoon,
where daytime heating will help to steepen low level lapse rates and
lead to at least marginal CAPE values.  Low level winds will be
quite veered and relatively weak.  However, a storm or two may be
briefly intense with gusty winds or hail.

...TX...
Clear skies will lead of strong heating and steepening lapse rates
across west-central TX today.  Most CAM solutions suggest one or two
storms could form in the well-mixed zone near San Angelo late this
afternoon.  Steep mid-level lapse rates would support a risk of hail
or damaging wind gusts in these storms.  After dark, a strengthening
southerly low-level jet would likely allow this activity to become
more numerous and spread northeastward toward the Red River.  The
overall severe threat would likely weaken after dark, but could
still pose a risk of occasional hail or gusty winds.

Valid 061300Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
PENINSULAR FLORIDA...SOUTH CAROLINA AND PARTS OF WEST-CENTRAL TO
NORTH TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of
peninsular Florida and South Carolina, and late afternoon into
tonight over parts of west-central to north Texas.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a progressive and amplifying pattern is
forecast over the CONUS through the period, mainly related to a
well-developed trough now approaching the CA coastline.  The
accompanying 500-mb low should move over the Point Conception area
around 18Z, then weaken inland across southern CA overnight. 
However, the trough will remain strong as an open-wave feature, as
it approaches the lower Colorado River Valley around 12Z. 
Downstream, a series of minor perturbations embedded in the
subtropical/southern stream will traverse northern MX and much of
TX.  Farther east, a shortwave trough was quite evident in
moisture-channel imagery over parts of TN, AL and GA, extending
southward to the northeastern Gulf.  This initially rather broad
perturbation will consolidate somewhat and cross parts of GA and the
western/upstate Carolinas by 00Z, then move northeastward into the
Mid-Atlantic by the end of the period. 

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a series of weak lows and
troughs scattered across the Southeast amid weak surface flow, with
a warm front along the SC and southern NC coast, then bending
southeastward offshore from HSE.  Northward movement of this
boundary will be delayed by precip/clouds this morning, but should
occur this afternoon across the inland Carolinas.  Meanwhile,
another frontal zone -- initially drawn over deep south TX -- should
migrate northward as a warm front today and tonight across much of
central/north TX and into OK tonight, connecting to overnight
surface cyclogenesis progged for the northwestern TX Panhandle. 

...FL...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop
this afternoon along sea-breeze boundaries and smaller-scale zones
of lift, amidst diabatically weakened MLCINH and favorable low-level
moisture.  The best-organized convection may produce damaging to
isolated severe downdrafts and isolated severe hail.  

The southern fringes of cooling aloft related to the southeastern
CONUS perturbation, atop upper 60s to low 70s F surface dewpoints,
in a deep troposphere, will lead to peak/preconvective MLCAPE in the
1500-2500 J/kg range.  Activity should be predominantly
multicellular, with modest low/middle level flow limiting most
measures of bulk shear.  However, relatively strong upper/anvil-
level winds will ventilate convection to some extent and contribute
to around 50-70 kt of shear from LCL to EL.  Near the East Coast sea
breeze, some backed low-level flow is possible that may augment
low-level and deep shear enough for at least transient storm-scale
rotation and a marginal/brief tornado potential as well.  

...SC and vicinity...
An extensive plume of precip -- with isolated to widely scattered,
sporadic, embedded thunderstorms -- is shifting roughly
northeastward across parts of GA, the Carolinas and eastern TN. 
This activity is supported regionally by a combination of warm
advection and moisture transport, with related modest, elevated
destabilization.  Severe conditions are not expected with this
activity due to insufficiency of both buoyancy and shear.  

However, especially over the Low Country/coastal plain and perhaps
central SC, a second round of convective development is expected
late this afternoon into evening, offering marginally severe hail or
strong/damaging gusts.  This activity should follow several hours of
airmass recovery through a combination of diabatic heating,
continued low-level warm advection, and DCVA/cooling aloft nearer to
the "cold-core" region of mid/upper-level perturbation.  These
processes should steepen low-level lapse rates and weaken MLCINH,
while slightly increasing previously poor midlevel lapse rates by
late afternoon.  In combination with favorable near-surface moisture
(dewpoints generally low/mid 60s F), this should support around
800-1200 J/kg MLCAPE.  Though low-level hodographs/SRH/bulk shear
shouldn't be large, around 30-40 kt effective-shear magnitudes are
expected, with some organized multicell or transient supercell
structures possible.  Convection should weaken and exit the area by
late evening. 

...West-central/northwest/north-central TX...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms are possible from late
afternoon into the overnight period -- initially over parts of the
Big Country/Concho Valley regions of west-central TX, then
spreading/shifting northward and northeastward with time tonight. 
Isolated severe hail is the main concern, though strong/locally
severe gusts cannot be ruled out either.  The northward-returning
frontal zone appears to be the most probable source of low-level
lift, through some chance exists for surface parcels to reach
convective temperature on southwestern parts of the outlook area. 
Low-level warm advection and moisture transport/recovery will
strengthen considerably from late afternoon through overnight across
the region, as the Pacific mid/upper trough approaches, the subtle
southern-stream perturbations move overhead, and southwest flow
increases aloft.  This should lead to increasing convective
coverage, though uncertainty lingers on spatial extent and density,
given the subtlety of overall lift.  

Environmentally, upstream high-cloud cover prevalent in satellite
imagery should thicken through the day, lending further uncertainty
to specific initiation timing/location, but still allowing enough
heating to weaken MLCINH by late afternoon.  CINH will weaken
further this evening into tonight because of warm advection/
isentropic ascent to LFC -- particularly as the southerly LLJ
strengthens overnight to around 40-50 kt.  The moisture increase
(especially above the surface) and warm advection will contribute to
MUCAPE around 1000 J/kg, most of it in low/middle levels below a
more-stable mid/upper regime related to the cloud deck.  Some
convective organization is possible, amidst 30-40 kt effective-shear
magnitudes.

0352 AM CST Tue Mar 05 2024

...DISCUSSION...
Enhanced mid/upper-level flow associated with an upper trough will
overspread much of the southern Plains into the lower MS Valley and
central Gulf Coast States on Day 4/Friday. Thunderstorms should be
ongoing Friday morning across parts of central/east TX. Strong
deep-layer shear should continue to support updraft organization,
with enough MUCAPE present for robust convection. The severe threat
on Friday should shift from TX into the lower MS Valley in tandem
with a northward-developing warm sector and low-level moisture
return. Latest guidance has trended slightly later with the upper
trough ejection, and depicts a somewhat weaker surface low.
Accordingly, it appears that the rich low-level moisture may not
advance as far northward as indicated previously across the central
Gulf Coast States. Have therefore trimmed the northern extent of the
15% severe area for Friday across central MS/AL. There will still be
a severe risk for areas closer to the coast, where a favorable
thermodynamic and kinematic environment should support a threat for
tornadoes, damaging winds, and hail with surface-based convection
through Friday night.

The upper trough and related mid/upper-level jet should continue
moving eastward across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions on Day
5/Saturday. Some severe threat should persist across these areas
through Saturday night. However, there may be a tendency for
convection to outpace the low-level moisture return and gradually
become more elevated with eastward extent across the Southeast.
Still, parts of southern AL into the FL Panhandle/north FL and
GA/SC/NC will be closely monitored for possible inclusion in a 15%
severe area if confidence increases that sufficient instability will
exist to support surface-based thunderstorms and a corresponding
risk for tornadoes and damaging winds. Once the surface cold front
associated with the upper cyclone clears the East Coast on Day
6/Sunday, severe potential should remain minimal across the CONUS
through early next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 AM CST Tue Mar 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
A northern-stream midlevel shortwave trough will cross the northern
Plains during the afternoon, while a related surface cyclone tracks
northeastward from SD across northwestern MN. Along/east of the
surface cyclone, a tightening pressure gradient, coupled with
shallow boundary-layer mixing into a southerly low-level jet, will
yield 20-25 mph sustained southerly surface winds (with gusts
upwards of 45 mph) across portions of northeastern NE, eastern SD,
far northwest IA, and western MN. While RH reductions will be
limited, owing to slightly cool surface temperatures (especially
with northward extent), high-resolution ensemble guidance suggests
that 25-30 percent minimum RH is possible. As a result, an elevated
wind-driven fire-weather risk is expected, given modestly receptive
fuels across the region.

Farther south, midlevel west-southwesterly flow will strengthen
across the southern Rockies -- ahead of midlevel trough/low 
moving ashore over southern CA. In response, weak lee cyclogenesis
is expected over eastern CO, favoring 15-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds (with higher gusts) across the southern
High Plains. Here, downslope warming/drying will contribute to 15
percent minimum RH, leading to elevated/locally critical
fire-weather conditions during the afternoon.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are unlikely for the remainder of tonight.

...Northern WI into Upper MI...
Thunderstorms are ongoing early this evening across northwest WI,
along and ahead of a cold front attendant to a deep surface cyclone
centered near the ND/MN/MB border. Strong ascent in combination with
steep low/midlevel lapse rates across the region has compensated for
generally limited low-level moisture, though buoyancy remains weak,
with MUCAPE generally less than 500 J/kg. Small hail and gusty winds
will remain possible with these storms as they move across northern
WI into Upper MI and over Lake Superior through the evening. See MCD
187 for more information. 

...Florida...
A downward trend in storm coverage/intensity has been noted over
Florida this evening, though an ongoing storm cluster west of Lake
Okeechobee could pose a threat for small hail and gusty winds for as
long as it persists. Substantial earlier convective overturning over
much of the Peninsula and the loss of diurnal heating should
contribute to a continued overall weakening trend with time tonight.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CST Sun Mar 03 2024

Valid 051200Z - 111200Z

A relatively zonal upper pattern will encourage locally dry and
windy conditions across the Plains states Tuesday-Wednesday, before
dry and windy conditions increase across the southern High Plains
later this week in advance of an approaching mid-level trough.
Medium range guidance members show some potential for Critical
overlapping winds/RH somewhere from the Texas/New Mexico border to
the Rio Grande during the Thursday-Saturday period. However, the
medium range members vary too much in placement and timing of the
aforementioned Critical winds/RH for Critical probabilities to be
introduced at this time. Nonetheless, prolonged dry conditions are
expected to continue through the week across the southern High
Plains, with no appreciable precipitation accumulations expected. As
such, Critical probabilities or fire weather highlights will likely
be introduced at some point later this week across the southern High
Plains once guidance members show better agreement in the placement
and timing of conditions favorable for wildfire spread.
