<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>What would you do to get your reporting in front of an audience of
hundreds of thousands? Or maybe even millions? Here’s a hint: You don’t
have to get on the evening news. In 2025, let’s imagine a new type of
journalist in newsrooms across the country: A content creator. Picture a
modern-day news anchor…</p>

<p>We find ourselves in a moment that can be best described as a
negative moment. We are returning to the sunken place, overcome with
terror at what might be, still burdened by the scars from last time. We
saw respectable news organizations make a political choice of
“neutrality” in the face of what many saw…</p>

investigations become a mainstay of news</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Over the last decade, many major news organizations have set up teams
and sub-brands devoted to “visual investigations” or “visual forensics.”
Their success signals the next major shift in reporting practices.
Similar to “data journalism” before them, visual investigations are
poised to move from niche desks to standard operating procedure in
newsrooms in 2025 as…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>When Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, there was
a collective sense of shock — I don’t think even he expected to win.
This time, it’s giving resignation and despair — or triumphalism
depending on your political persuasion. The last time this happened,
scholars and journalists sought to explain what then seemed
inexplicable….</p>

<p>The recent U.S. presidential election made it even clearer (if anyone
needed proof) that podcasters, YouTubers, and content creators are
closer to the audience than traditional media and journalists, and their
opinions mobilize more people. This has been happening for years, but in
many sectors of journalism (at least in Latin America) we’ve refused

<p>It’s ironic that listening is one of the core skills in journalism
and yet we spend very little time listening inward — to our own selves
and to each other. Focusing on our external audience is essential to our
business; however, paying attention and caring for our colleagues is
just as important to our sustainability….</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>If I’m going to predict the future, I find it useful to return to the
past. As a kid, I wanted to be a journalist because I dreamed of seeing
the world, meeting people who were different from me, and telling their
stories. I suspect many of us were drawn to journalism for similar
reasons:…</p>

dark patterns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>A significant amount of media attention and scholarship has focused
on mis- and disinformation in news, centering both the platforms that
allow news organizations to share misinformation as well as the news
organizations that have published misinformation — whether about public
health, the elections, or disaster relief. The attention on this kind of
deception is…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>As a lifelong journalist, it’s been disheartening to watch the
election and its aftermath. Like many readers, I’ve always believed that
if you just show the audience the truth or if you uncover wrongdoing,
people will act and demand change. But I’ve spent the last few weeks
questioning my vocation. The divided news ecosystem originated…</p>

journalistic independence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Threats to journalistic independence are appearing at increasing
rates worldwide, including in established democracies — a situation
which, frankly, deserves more attention than it often receives. These
threats have now crossed a new threshold here in the United States. As

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>In 2025, journalism education will face another challenging year.
With declining student enrollment in journalism and mass communication
programs, increasing workloads on educators, and curriculum challenges
with depth and breadth of covering the basics of newsgathering while
providing the latest skillsets, journalism education has its work cut
out for itself. As the news industry continues…</p>
