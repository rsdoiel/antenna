Gophers burrow Bruins’ lead with last-minute touchdown in Rose Bowl
loss</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Ethan Garbers wasn’t scheduled to start an hour before Saturday’s
kickoff.  But on the Bruins’ first drive, the redshirt senior
quarterback took the field.  And on UCLA’s final drive – with 27 seconds
left on the clock – Garbers was the team’s last hope.  However, the
seasoned signal-caller was depleted of his magic tricks by the fourth
quarter.  With seven seconds to play, Garbers tossed deep into the night
– and right into the hands of defensive back Koi Perich – for his third
interception of the game.  As UCLA football (1-5, 0-4 Big Ten) lived and
died by its veteran quarterback, Minnesota (4-3, 2-2) emerged victorious
21-17 at the Rose Bowl on Saturday night.  “This is a tough loss, so
this one’s going to sting a little bit,” said coach DeShaun Foster.</p>
