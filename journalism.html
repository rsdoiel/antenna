(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>In the coming year, the newsrooms that thrive won’t be the ones chasing the next platform change, algorithm tweak, or business model that might save us. They will be the ones preparing for multiple realities at once, with focus, steadiness, and a plan. My prediction is simple: Scenario planning — done consistently, cross-functionally and proactively...</p>

      <p>Permit me to make a very big deal out of a very, very small slice of the history of journalism.

      <p>Journalism must embrace complexity to have an abundant future. Our information infrastructure is built on the volcanoes of capitalism — a system that demands flattening, that rewards the derivative, that incentivizes stories designed to polarize rather than illuminate. This flattening doesn’t just distort our work; it enables erasure and makes authoritarianism’s job easier. Authoritarianism thrives...</p>

      <h1>The year journalism goes underground in America</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Forty years of toxic media policy, the libertarian ethos of big tech, the collapse of the 20th-century business model, the paranoia and extremism of online life, the rise of the far right: when stirred together, these nutrients do not constitute the soil for a healthy free press. This is certainly not the first time people...</p>

      <h1>Short-form video drives reach. That’s exactly the problem.</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>The industry is pivoting (again) to short-form vertical video right when audiences are exhausted by algorithm-driven feeds and seeking refuge from visual overload. Social media traffic is declining. Platforms have deprioritized our journalism. And yet, newsrooms are doubling down on the very formats audiences are abandoning, convinced we just need to tell the story in...</p>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>For more than a decade, social media didn’t just serve Black communities, immigrant communities, and young people — these communities built social media into the global force it became. They were the early adopters, the culture-makers, the organizers, the storytellers. Hyperlocal newsrooms were born on Facebook groups. WhatsApp became a lifeline for immigrant families.

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>If 2025 was the year the world woke up to democratic backsliding, 2026 may be the year journalism decides whether it will face that crisis alone or survive it together. Around the globe, authoritarians have learned to use the law to criminalize dissent through courts that perform an apparent due process while they dismantle it....</p>

      <p>At some point in deep autumn, it finally happened.

      <p>I was recently having a conversation with Natalia Antelava, founder of the newsroom Coda, about social media regulation.

When things are good, things are perfect – happiness is deserved, hope is everlasting and both the people and processes that made success happen in the first place could never do anything wrong.</p>

      <p>In 2026, the biggest challenge for news consumers won’t be finding information — it will be figuring out what to trust and how to make sense of a deluge of competing narratives and facts.

      <p>
      <p>In 2026, two forces that have been reshaping media will reach critical mass: the creator-driven information ecosystem and cognitive personalization. News creators Audiences increasingly evaluate individual pieces of information and contributors rather than trusting institutional brands wholesale. They assemble their understanding of the world as a patchwork: a podcast recap, a TikTok debunk, a Reddit...</p>

This time, the catalyst was a talk by Noura Erakat, a professor at Rutgers University, on the theme of “Revisiting Zionism as a Form of Racism and Racial Discrimination.” Campus critics of the event argued that it lacked balance and contributed to a feeling of unsafety for many Jews on campus.</p>

      <p>
      <p>When it comes to AI, there is a growing murmur that we are in bubble territory and might be headed for a burst, perhaps as early as next year. A key reason commonly cited is the large chasm between AI computing infrastructure spending and AI revenue, as well as the lack of clear business models...</p>

      <p>News today can be a lot to take in. Deportations. Wars. Tariffs. Trump did what?! The consistent barrage of negative, seemingly urgent events can wear people down, so much so that news fatigue has become a common experience.

      <p>For years, journalism has treated misinformation as a truth problem. A false story pops up, journalists or fact-checkers correct it, and the record is corrected. But today’s most damaging falsehoods do not spread because people believe them. They spread because they express anger, signal identity, build a sense of belonging, provoke humor, or even channel...</p>
