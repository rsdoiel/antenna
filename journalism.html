the world’s tech capital, Gazetteer SF is staying off platforms to
produce good local journalism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>One night in May, reporter Eddie Kim went for a walk in San
Francisco. Kim, a news reporter for Gazetteer SF, wanted to retrace the
steps of a tech company founder who tweeted that a two-mile walk from
