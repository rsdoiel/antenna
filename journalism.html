vetoes bill that would allow undocumented students to hold campus
jobs</h2>

<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill Sunday that would have
allowed undocumented students to hold campus jobs at California’s public

bill due to its potential to put state employees in violation of a
federal law that bans employees from hiring undocumented immigrants.</p>
