AI chatbot helped Americans who believe in conspiracy theories “exit the
rabbit hole”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The uncle who believes 9/11 never happened. The next-door neighbor
who thinks Biden stole the 2020 election. The Nieman Lab editor who’s
been known to wonder if aliens really do exist and the U.S. government
is covering them up. You probably don’t want to talk to these people and
convince them that they are wrong….</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Last year, Rachel Antell was working on her latest documentary. An
archival producer, Antell’s credits include the Academy Award-nominated
Crip Camp and the CNN Film Chowchilla. She was tasked with sourcing
archival photos, this time for a sweeping historical survey. It was just
months after the release of ChatGPT, and Antell joked with her
producing…</p>

newsrooms help drive citizen journalism in North Macedonia and
beyond</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The lakeside location, historic churches, and pretty cobbled streets
of Ohrid in North Macedonia draw hundreds of thousands of tourists each
year. But the city’s status as a UNESCO-protected gem has not defended
it from rampant overdevelopment and corruption. When notorious local
politician and businessman Nefi Useini began to illegally build a
pizzeria near an…</p>

California Google deal could leave out news startups and the smallest
publishers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Last month, Google and California struck a groundbreaking,
controversial deal to funnel almost $250 million into the state’s
journalism over five years (while shoehorning in…an AI accelerator),
sidestepping a more sweeping effort to force Google and Meta to pay news
publishers. The closed-door deal has been covered, pragmatically
praised, and excoriated here and elsewhere. But…</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>It’s been a big year for Lookout, the local news company founded by
longtime Nieman Lab columnist and news industry analyst Ken Doctor. In
May, its first newsroom, Lookout Santa Cruz on the California coast, won
an obscure little bauble called the Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News
Reporting. (“For its detailed and nimble community-focused
coverage,…</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>There have been few digital news outlets with a more complicated
brand history than what used to be Recode. First came All Things
Digital, a technology site born within The Wall Street Journal in 2007.
Six years later, its two most prominent faces — Kara Swisher and Walt
Mossberg — left the Journal to start…</p>

tech is painting itself as journalism’s savior. We should tread
carefully.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>We’ve long been warned about the looming demise of traditional
journalism in the face of digital disruption. But some tech giants, once
the very disruptors themselves, have been positioning themselves as
journalism’s saviors. Programs such as the Google News Initiative
promise not only to keep journalism alive, but by enabling innovation,
to also help it…</p>

the Minnesota Star Tribune: A conversation with Steve Grove</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, already one of
the healthiest metro newspapers in the country, announced a thorough
“reboot,” including a re-branding as the Minnesota Star Tribune. Late
last month, I spoke with Steve Grove, the paper’s CEO and publisher
since April of last year, about the thinking behind the moves. Grove
