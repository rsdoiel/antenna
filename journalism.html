“Sorry, I don’t know” is sometimes the best answer: The Washington
Post’s technology chief on its first AI chatbot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Earlier this month, The Washington Post debuted its first generative
AI chatbot, Climate Answers. The chatbot’s promise is to take in
readers’ most pressing questions about climate change science, policy,
and politics, and turn out a brief summary of the Post’s reporting on
that topic, with full citations and link outs to relevant stories.

<p>Good news or bad news? It depends. Are you an internet user who cares
about privacy? An internet publisher who cares about making money? Or
somewhere in between? On Monday afternoon, Google shocked the
online-advertising world by saying that, actually, despite years of
promises, it wouldn’t be dropping cookies from its world-dominant web
browser, Chrome….</p>

you pay to be able to quit TikTok and Instagram? You’d be surprised how
many would</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Social media is a problem for economists. They don’t know how to
value it. It has long been argued that it ought to be in the national
accounts as part of gross domestic product. One 2019 study estimated
Facebook alone is worth $40 to $50 per month for consumers in the United
States. But that’s…</p>

The ways people hear about big news these days; “into a million pieces,”

<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>It’s not often that massive political news breaks on a Sunday
afternoon — especially one in steamy late July, the leading edge of the
Greater August vacation season. But break news Joe Biden most certainly
did with this tweet announcing he would not run for reelection this
fall. pic.twitter.com/RMIRvlSOYw — Joe Biden (<span class="citation"

1924, a magazine ran a contest: “Who is to pay for broadcasting and
how?” A century later, we’re still asking the same question</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>After yet another day reading about audio industry layoffs and show
cancellations, or listening to podcasts about layoffs and show
cancellations, I sometimes wonder, “With all this great audio being
given away for free, who did we think was supposed to pay for it all?” I
find some consolation in the fact that that question…</p>
