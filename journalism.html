The losing streak continues for No. 19 UCLA women&#8217;s volleyball (1-3), who fell in back-to-back matches against No.

      Goldberg responded to the defense&#8217;s arguments surrounding Olivia Truong – a former student of Klein’s who claimed he has a history of sending inappropriate emails – by calling the argument &#8220;a weird smear.&#8221; He added that Klein was never accused of sexual harassment and said Bernardo&#8217;s decision to suspend him was unrelated to Truong.

      Sandra McDonough, an attorney for the UC Regents and Bernardo, said the publicity from Klein’s email was enough to damage his reputation alone. She added that screenshots of Klein’s emails received around 18 million impressions across platforms before Bernardo informed the School of Management that Klein would be put on leave.

      Steven M. Goldberg, an attorney for Klein, said the central question in the case is Bernardo’s motivations for suspending Klein. Goldberg added that the University acted out of a desire to appear &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;appease students,&#8221; calling the move &#8220;ill-motivated&#8221; and a violation of Klein’s academic freedom.

      The trial concluded with closing arguments from both sides. Klein’s attorney said Bernardo’s emails misrepresented Klein and hurt his ability to attract new clients, adding that Madsen’s estimate of damages was conservative.
