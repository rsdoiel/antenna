      Goldberg responded to the defense&#8217;s arguments surrounding Olivia Truong – a former student of Klein’s who claimed he has a history of sending inappropriate emails – by calling the argument &#8220;a weird smear.&#8221; He added that Klein was never accused of sexual harassment and said Bernardo&#8217;s decision to suspend him was unrelated to Truong.

Goldberg added that the University acted out of a desire to appear &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;appease students,&#8221; calling the move &#8220;ill-motivated&#8221; and a violation of Klein’s academic freedom.
