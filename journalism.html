      A court ruled Thursday that UC Regent Jay Sures must pay $150,624 of graduate student Dylan Kupsh’s legal fees after Sures unsuccessfully attempted to file a restraining order against him.&#160;
Kupsh – along with around 50 other pro-Palestine protesters – demonstrated outside Sures’ Brentwood home in February, calling him &#8220;responsible for protecting UC investments in genocide and weapons manufacturing.” Lawyers representing Sures initially alleged that Kupsh was a “ringleader” among the protesters, but were unable to prove the claim in court.
