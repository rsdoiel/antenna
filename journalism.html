<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Laloyolan (LMU Student Newspaper)</p>

<p>There are eight recognized planets, according to the International
Astronomical Union’s current definition of the term – but a new proposal
could change that. The proposal – co-written by Jean-Luc Margot, a

well as Physics and Astronomy – was submitted to the IAU to be
considered at its 2024 General Assembly, which occurred in August.</p>
