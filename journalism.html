      UCPD arrested a suspect who allegedly stabbed a person at the Chabad House at UCLA on Friday.
Jeffrey Chobanian, the acting captain of UCPD’s operations bureau, said in a written statement that the stabbing occurred during a “roommate dispute” in a common area of the Chabad House, which is located on Gayley Avenue across from the UCLA Medical Plaza.&#160;
UCPD determined that the incident was not a hate crime, Chobanian said in the statement, although the situation is still being investigated.

      Defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe and the university mutually agreed to part ways, UCLA football interim head coach Tim Skipper announced Wednesday at practice.

He first joined the staff in 2021 as an outside linebackers and special teams coach and was elevated to the defensive line in 2023, one year before his promotion to his former post.

      No. 18 UCLA women&#8217;s soccer (3-2) will face No. 1 Stanford (6-0) on Sunday afternoon at Wallis Annenberg Stadium. The Bruins started their season off on a weak note, falling to two opponents back-to-back in their second and third games, but bouncing back to win the next two matchups.

      Goldberg responded to the defense&#8217;s arguments surrounding Olivia Truong – a former student of Klein’s who claimed he has a history of sending inappropriate emails – by calling the argument &#8220;a weird smear.&#8221; He added that Klein was never accused of sexual harassment and said Bernardo&#8217;s decision to suspend him was unrelated to Truong.

      Sandra McDonough, an attorney for the UC Regents and Bernardo, said the publicity from Klein’s email was enough to damage his reputation alone. She added that screenshots of Klein’s emails received around 18 million impressions across platforms before Bernardo informed the School of Management that Klein would be put on leave.

      Steven M. Goldberg, an attorney for Klein, said the central question in the case is Bernardo’s motivations for suspending Klein. Goldberg added that the University acted out of a desire to appear &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;appease students,&#8221; calling the move &#8220;ill-motivated&#8221; and a violation of Klein’s academic freedom.

      The trial concluded with closing arguments from both sides. Klein’s attorney said Bernardo’s emails misrepresented Klein and hurt his ability to attract new clients, adding that Madsen’s estimate of damages was conservative.
