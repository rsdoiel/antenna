Bob Chesney wasted no time bringing familiar faces to the West Coast.
First, it was offensive coordinator Dean Kennedy, who spent two seasons with the now-UCLA head coach at Holy Cross and the past two years at James Madison, where he led the 11th-highest scoring offense in the FBS.</p>

      <p>Men’s volleyball is growing.
Whether it be the addition of two new teams – Jessup University and UC Merced – to the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in 2026 and another – Pacific – in 2027 or the expansion of the NCAA tournament from 10 to 12 teams, the sport has witnessed unprecedented growth in the last year.</p>

      <p>
      <p>In the last century, journalists labored mightily to unionize the print media industry–along the way, turning their raffish profession into an (almost) middle class job. Then the internet was invented. Print media declined and online media rose. For the past decade, online media journalists have unionized their industry as well. Unfortunately, tech platforms have perfected...</p>
