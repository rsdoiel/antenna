      <h1>Federal funding application process, impact of loss of funding for researchers</h1>

(date: 2025-10-17)
      <p>
      <p>UCLA and the Trump Administration have been at odds over federal funding for months.
In July, The Trump administration suspended an estimated $584 million of research funding to UCLA, alleging that the university failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students from antisemitism, implemented affirmative action in their admission practices and allegedly allowed “men to participate in women’s sports.”
While a federal judge ordered the restoration of most of the funding, the struggle breaks a long tradition of cooperation between university institutions and the federal government in research development.</p>

      <p>Fred Ramsdell became the ninth UCLA alumnus to receive the Nobel Prize Monday.
Ramsdell, who earned his doctorate in microbiology and immunology from UCLA in 1987, received the 2025 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine alongside Mary Brunkow and Shimon Sakaguchi – who hail from the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, and Osaka University in Japan – for discoveries related to immune regulation.
The trio helped uncover how the gene Foxp3 directs the development of regulatory T cells –  specialized immune cells that prevent the body from becoming overactive and attacking its own tissues, according to the scientific journal Nature.</p>

The Bruins were flying high for nearly four straight weeks, sitting atop the Big Ten while raking in wins after a shaky start to the season that featured losses to then-No.</p>

With Thursday’s contest occurring squarely in the middle of week one for UCLA students and Saturday being UCLA football’s first contest at the Rose Bowl this academic year – No.</p>

The final pillar of the DeShaun Foster era fell Tuesday.

With the Bruins’ top three coaches out the door, a power vacuum was created.</p>

      <p>UCLA football’s (0-4, 0-1 Big Ten) second season in the Big Ten promised new horizons. Instead, the Bruins find themselves in a dire situation. Their 17-14 loss against Northwestern on Saturday extended a winless start amid the removal of head coach DeShaun Foster and the departure of defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe and cemented them in the basement of the Big Ten.</p>

Mariah Carey is here for a fresh set of solid R&amp;B throwbacks on “Here For It All.”
The superstar’s sixteenth album was released Friday, with 11 tracks composing her first LP of original material since 2018’s “Caution.” The 40-minute project – complete with guest appearances from Anderson .Paak, Shenseea, Kehlani and The Clark Sisters – uses its brevity to its advantage with a tight, concise package of slick, mostly midtempo jams.</p>
