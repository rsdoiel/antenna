      <p>When I read the article “UCLA student Jessica Rose pursues self-publishing, discusses commitment,” I immediately thought of my own experiences with self-publishing and co-authoring research.
Her reflections on doubt and perseverance reminded me that the first steps toward a project, no matter how small, often feel the hardest, but they are the ones that make the biggest difference.</p>

Bob Chesney wasted no time bringing familiar faces to the West Coast.
First, it was offensive coordinator Dean Kennedy, who spent two seasons with the now-UCLA head coach at Holy Cross and the past two years at James Madison, where he led the 11th-highest scoring offense in the FBS.</p>
