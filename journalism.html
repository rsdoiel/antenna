UCLA and the Trump Administration have been at odds over federal funding for months.
In July, The Trump administration suspended an estimated $584 million of research funding to UCLA, alleging that the university failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students from antisemitism, implemented affirmative action in their admission practices and allegedly allowed “men to participate in women’s sports.”
While a federal judge ordered the restoration of most of the funding, the struggle breaks a long tradition of cooperation between university institutions and the federal government in research development.</p>

      <p>Fred Ramsdell became the ninth UCLA alumnus to receive the Nobel Prize Monday.
Ramsdell, who earned his doctorate in microbiology and immunology from UCLA in 1987, received the 2025 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine alongside Mary Brunkow and Shimon Sakaguchi – who hail from the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, and Osaka University in Japan – for discoveries related to immune regulation.
The trio helped uncover how the gene Foxp3 directs the development of regulatory T cells –  specialized immune cells that prevent the body from becoming overactive and attacking its own tissues, according to the scientific journal Nature.</p>
