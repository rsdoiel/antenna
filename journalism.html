      <h1>David Geffen School of Medicine under investigation for antisemitism claims</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26, from: <a href="https://dailybruin.com/2025/08/25/david-geffen-school-of-medicine-under-investigation-for-antisemitism-claims/">The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</a>)
      <p>
      The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce announced Monday that it is investigating the David Geffen School of Medicine over antisemitism claims.&#160;
In a letter addressed to Steven Dubinett, the school’s dean, chairman Tim Walberg – a Michigan Republican – said the committee has been made aware of reports that Jewish students at the medical school experienced “hostility and fear at the hands of peers, colleagues, and administrators” and that their concerns were not addressed by the university.&#160;
He added in the letter that the committee is looking into if UCLA violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits “any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance” from discrimination based on race, color or national origin, according to the U.S.

      A court ruled Thursday that UC Regent Jay Sures must pay $150,624 of graduate student Dylan Kupsh’s legal fees after Sures unsuccessfully attempted to file a restraining order against him.&#160;
Kupsh – along with around 50 other pro-Palestine protesters – demonstrated outside Sures’ Brentwood home in February, calling him &#8220;responsible for protecting UC investments in genocide and weapons manufacturing.” Lawyers representing Sures initially alleged that Kupsh was a “ringleader” among the protesters, but were unable to prove the claim in court.

She said that, based on impression data from Cision, Klein’s media appearances – including him speaking about his administrative leave on Fox News multiple times – created “substantial media attention” around the situation, while the email announcing his leave which was sent to Anderson School of Management students did not.
