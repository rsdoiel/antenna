(date: 2025-10-06)
      <p>
      <p>Fred Ramsdell became the ninth UCLA alumnus to receive the Nobel Prize Monday.<br />
Ramsdell, who earned his doctorate in microbiology and immunology from UCLA in 1987, received the 2025 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine alongside Mary Brunkow and Shimon Sakaguchi – who hail from the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, and Osaka University in Japan – for discoveries related to immune regulation.<br />
The trio helped uncover how the gene Foxp3 directs the development of regulatory T cells –  specialized immune cells that prevent the body from becoming overactive and attacking its own tissues, according to the scientific journal Nature.</p>

Maybe it’s best that the Bruins’ first two home matches were seemingly overlooked by many.<br />
With Thursday’s contest occurring squarely in the middle of week one for UCLA students and Saturday being UCLA football’s first contest at the Rose Bowl this academic year – No.</p>

      <p>UCLA football’s (0-4, 0-1 Big Ten) second season in the Big Ten promised new horizons. Instead, the Bruins find themselves in a dire situation. Their 17-14 loss against Northwestern on Saturday extended a winless start amid the removal of head coach DeShaun Foster and the departure of defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe and cemented them in the basement of the Big Ten.</p>

Mariah Carey is here for a fresh set of solid R&amp;B throwbacks on “Here For It All.”<br />
The superstar’s sixteenth album was released Friday, with 11 tracks composing her first LP of original material since 2018’s “Caution.” The 40-minute project – complete with guest appearances from Anderson .Paak, Shenseea, Kehlani and The Clark Sisters – uses its brevity to its advantage with a tight, concise package of slick, mostly midtempo jams.</p>

Nearly two months after the federal government froze over half a billion dollars in research funding to UCLA, the National Institutes of Health has temporarily reinstated its suspended grants Tuesday – abiding by a federal judge’s Monday ruling.&#160;
Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activities Roger Wakimoto announced the restatement in a Wednesday email to the UCLA community, where he added that the majority of the university’s suspended grants have temporarily been reinstated.&#160;
The federal government suspended $584 million dollars in funding to UCLA – including $500 million from the NIH – July 30 and 31.

      UCPD arrested a suspect who allegedly stabbed a person at the Chabad House at UCLA on Friday.
Jeffrey Chobanian, the acting captain of UCPD’s operations bureau, said in a written statement that the stabbing occurred during a “roommate dispute” in a common area of the Chabad House, which is located on Gayley Avenue across from the UCLA Medical Plaza.&#160;
UCPD determined that the incident was not a hate crime, Chobanian said in the statement, although the situation is still being investigated.
