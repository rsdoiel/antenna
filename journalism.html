      <h1>Album review: Mariah Carey’s ‘Here For It All’ may not be all we want, but we’re still obsessed</h1>

Mariah Carey is here for a fresh set of solid R&amp;B throwbacks on “Here For It All.”<br />
The superstar’s sixteenth album was released Friday, with 11 tracks composing her first LP of original material since 2018’s “Caution.” The 40-minute project – complete with guest appearances from Anderson .Paak, Shenseea, Kehlani and The Clark Sisters – uses its brevity to its advantage with a tight, concise package of slick, mostly midtempo jams.</p>

EVANSTON, Ill. – UCLA’s move to the Big Ten was described as a football move.

      <h1>NIH temporarily reinstates suspended UCLA grants following federal judge decision</h1>

(date: 2025-09-24)
      <p>
      <em>This post was updated Sept. 25 at 3:41 p.m.</em>
Nearly two months after the federal government froze over half a billion dollars in research funding to UCLA, the National Institutes of Health has temporarily reinstated its suspended grants Tuesday – abiding by a federal judge’s Monday ruling.&#160;
Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activities Roger Wakimoto announced the restatement in a Wednesday email to the UCLA community, where he added that the majority of the university’s suspended grants have temporarily been reinstated.&#160;
The federal government suspended $584 million dollars in funding to UCLA – including $500 million from the NIH – July 30 and 31.

The Bruins were tied 1-1 with the Badgers 13 minutes into the second half, and video review could not reverse the decision because the camera had not moved properly.

      <p>
      UCPD arrested a suspect who allegedly stabbed a person at the Chabad House at UCLA on Friday.
Jeffrey Chobanian, the acting captain of UCPD’s operations bureau, said in a written statement that the stabbing occurred during a “roommate dispute” in a common area of the Chabad House, which is located on Gayley Avenue across from the UCLA Medical Plaza.&#160;
UCPD determined that the incident was not a hate crime, Chobanian said in the statement, although the situation is still being investigated.

A UC Board of Regents committee voted unanimously Wednesday to recommend allocating an additional $2 million to replace an outdated UCLA emergency power system.&#160;
The project, first approved in 2020, will upgrade the emergency power system for the Center for Health Sciences and its adjacent buildings to ensure that research, clinical activities and safety remain protected in case of a power outage.

      <p>
      Defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe and the university mutually agreed to part ways, UCLA football interim head coach Tim Skipper announced Wednesday at practice.
Malloe was in his second year as the leader of the defense and was selected as a nominee for the Broyles Award, which is given to the nation’s best assistant coach, in 2024.&#160;
He first joined the staff in 2021 as an outside linebackers and special teams coach and was elevated to the defensive line in 2023, one year before his promotion to his former post.
