<p>We don’t talk about it. We don’t want to admit it. But racism is
still here, still present, and each one of us feels its weight in some
way. How can we still believe that a person’s worth can be defined by
the color of their skin or where they were born? How many times have I
heard, “Oh, you’re Italian? So, the mafia? Pizza? You don’t do much, do
you?” Stereotypes. Labels. Concepts created decades ago that somehow
still manage to stick. It’s in my bones, this feeling of being judged,
of being categorized. I don’t have darker skin, but I was born Italian.
I don’t deny it. I embrace it. And yet, I feel the sting of assumptions,
of remarks that make me feel misplaced in a world that should have moved
past this nonsense already.</p>

<p>You have probably walked along Catalina Ave. near Caltech or on
Caltech campus and have seen the signs warning of coyote activity in the
area. Perhaps you have even seen coyotes yourself on campus! I’ve
definitely had my fair share of coyote sightings on campus. One day I
came out of lab and walked past the lawn on S. Wilson Ave. near the
Broad Center. There chilling on the lawn was a coyote by himself. I
looked at him. He looked at me. I walked on the sidewalk. He sat on the
lawn. When my sidewalk path neared him on the grass, I kept my
trajectory clear and steady, but turned to the coyote as he watched me,
and I gave him a subtle nod and said “’sup”. He looked at me, unphased
and calm. I was also unphased and calm. I continued walking and he
continued chillin’.</p>

<p>JPL implemented its third round of layoffs in 2024 on November 13,
cutting 325 employees—roughly 5% of its workforce. This latest reduction
follows earlier waves: 100 contractors in January and 570 additional
employees and contractors in February. As a result, JPL’s workforce now
stands at approximately 5,500 employees. These job cuts stem from a
funding crisis centered around the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, a
flagship NASA initiative designed to retrieve and analyze Martian rock
and dust samples on Earth.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>Nicholas Winton is an English stockbroker who has a comfortable life
in 1930 London but knows that Hitler’s Germany is invading Praga,
Czechoslovakia; with a humanitarian group, he helps save 669 children
from Nazism. Winton worked quickly to find foster families for hundreds
of children—a beautiful and sad biographical story. Winton was a kind of
Schindler but an English one. Nicholas saved these children, but always
wondered what was going on with them. He kept this story a secret. Only
the people who helped save these children knew until his wife found a
scrapbook with photos of the children decades later (in 1988) and,
talking to her husband, discovered the whole story. Grete, his wife,
shared this story with a historian, which led to a British TV show. This
widely-watched program interviewed him and allowed him to meet these
“children” again, who were already adults at the time, in a very moving
encounter that was the film’s climax.</p>
