With the Enlightenment, the greatest scientific discoveries were made
such as light with Edison or more specific analyses at an anatomical

Laboratory to Santa Anita Avenue is just destruction. Caltech students,
postdocs, faculty, staff, and the surrounding community have been
impacted by this traumatic and devastating fire. At least 200 Caltech
community members have lost their homes to the fires. Thousands have
been displaced. Ash contamination, poor air quality, and loss of power

rest, a time of relaxation, and a time of rejuvenation. During these
three weeks, we slowly gather back up the energy needed for the upcoming

reason, we wanted to share with you how our respective winter breaks

illumination that I had trying to understand how to find a connection,

reality truly capable of transforming the simple idea of ​​thought, with
