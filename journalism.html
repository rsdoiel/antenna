you willing to pay for CNN.com? Prepare to be asked before year’s
end</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Paying for CNN is not something people are used to. Let me rephrase
that: Directly paying for CNN is not something people are used to. For
decades, an overwhelming majority of American households paid for cable
or satellite service, and an opaque slice of that monthly charge —
around $1 or so — found its…</p>

New York Times is “constantly thinking about the hierarchy of the
stories that we’re promoting,” Joe Kahn says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>In the two years that The New York Times executive editor Joe Kahn
has been on the job, there’s been a firehose flow of challenges to
tackle. In a New Yorker interview with Clare Malone published on
Wednesday, Kahn gets into just about all of them: the biggest
controversies of his tenure so far like…</p>

Morris on whether you should be afraid of generative AI in
documentaries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Errol Morris is used to being called a liar, a trickster, and a
manipulator. Over his storied four-decade career, Morris told me these
insults have been hurled at him again and again — often, because of how
he chooses to illustrate real life events. Today, The Thin Blue Line,
Morris’ investigation into the shooting of…</p>

the world’s tech capital, Gazetteer SF is staying off platforms to
produce good local journalism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>One night in May, reporter Eddie Kim went for a walk in San
Francisco. Kim, a news reporter for Gazetteer SF, wanted to retrace the
steps of a tech company founder who tweeted that a two-mile walk from
SoMa to Hayes Valley was “the sketchiest walk of my life.” (The tweet’s
been viewed more than…</p>

slouches forth from Michigan to be born</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>For Aaron Dworkin, poet, news is not that far from his butter and
bread of verse. Instead, he says, they’re siblings, of a kind. Combined,
they make a form anew, one which he calls (and here one must break the
meter) “Poetjournalism.” “I was thinking I had another poetry collection
in me, but I wanted…</p>

Meta bans news in Australia, what will happen? Canada’s experience is
telling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>At an Australian parliamentary hearing last month, Meta once again
suggested it could ban links to news on Facebook and Instagram in
Australia. This would repeat the ban it enacted for more than a week in
February 2021. That ban was in response to the introduction of the News
Media Bargaining Code, an Australian law…</p>
