      A court ruled Thursday that UC Regent Jay Sures must pay $150,624 of graduate student Dylan Kupsh’s legal fees after Sures unsuccessfully attempted to file a restraining order against him.&#160;
Kupsh – along with around 50 other pro-Palestine protesters – demonstrated outside Sures’ Brentwood home in February, calling him &#8220;responsible for protecting UC investments in genocide and weapons manufacturing.” Lawyers representing Sures initially alleged that Kupsh was a “ringleader” among the protesters, but were unable to prove the claim in court.

      Mohammed Cato, the director of Title IX at UCLA, testified Tuesday about a Title IX complaint that was made against Klein.
Cato said the office did not proceed with a formal investigation because the affected parties did not want to come forward.

      Justine Farrell, the chair of the marketing department at the University of San Diego&#8217;s Knauss School of Business, said Tuesday during testimony that information from the media analytics platform Cision, Anderson School of Management social media accounts and UCLA email metrics indicated that Klein’s actions following his administrative leave garnered greater attention about the situation than UCLA’s response.

      In the most remote parts of Alaska, staying in touch can involve a bit more effort than sending a text.

      Asmara Carbado, a former investigative attorney for UCLA&#8217;s Discrimination Prevention Office, testified about the office’s preliminary assessment into Klein’s email.
She said that while she believed Klein&#8217;s email response was racially insensitive and reflected “poor judgment,” it did not ultimately affect the sender of the email&#8217;s ability to learn.
