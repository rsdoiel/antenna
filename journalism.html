The neo soul songstress released her third album, “Vacancy,” on Friday – one of the first major R&amp;B releases of the new year and her first LP since 2022’s “age/sex/location.” The 15-track, 51-minute album leans heavily upon Lennox’s past lyrical themes about sex and relationship woes while adopting a more jazzy sound than her previous work, complete with rich saxophone throughout.</p>

      <p>UCLA has consistently underallocated funds to pest control in its residential dining halls, despite warning signs.
The dining halls – including Feast at Rieber, De Neve Residential Restaurant, Bruin Plate and Epicuria at Covel – have not allocated sufficient money for pest control since 2017, consistently failing to increase budgets despite the departments being forced to blow through them each year.
And amid the administration’s cuts to pest control budgets, a rat infestation forced the closure of Feast in May 2025.</p>

(date: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>Surrounding oneself with strong support is a recipe for success.
