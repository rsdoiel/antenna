<p>Predictions — said someone — are a fool’s game. But there’s little

<p>“Don’t read the comments.” It’s advice editors often give writers
when their first piece goes viral online. Yet it’s always struck me as
odd guidance — why publish on the internet, a medium built for
interconnection, only to ignore how readers respond to your work? What
“don’t read the comments” almost always really means is…</p>

<p>I was ready to break up with journalism in 2020 when I decided to go

<p>The darkness that democracy dies in is here. Some might call that
hyperbolic, but as a practitioner, scholar, and close observer of
journalism for more than 25 years, I’ve lost faith that well-meaning
criticism of journalists who engage in horse-race coverage, false
equivalence, and lazy, narrow ways of defining objectivity will make any
meaningful difference….</p>

<p>For better or worse, I don’t think there will be a “Trump Bump” in
traffic to news websites during the second Trump administration. There

<p>AI is everywhere. Amidst all the doom and hype, newsrooms are
