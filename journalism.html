Hours</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-08, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>One of the projects ASCIT B.o.D. adopted in 2023 was to review the
building accessibility policies for undergraduate students outside of
normal operational hours. For context, following the pandemic, building
access was understandably limited in order to prioritize the safety and
health of the campus communities. Since then, many of the previous
building accessibility policies have been reinstated. The following
outlines what these policies are, and who to reach out to should you
experience difficulties. Additionally, while there are buildings that
all students have access to, students also have access to specific (and
relevant) buildings based upon the division that their option is in.
Thus, the following will outline the building policies for each division
as well as campus-wide accessibility.</p>

Students</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-08, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>Caltech claims to strive to “expand human knowledge and benefit
society.” A necessary requisite to accomplish this mission is a
community that values intellectual diversity. One where peers challenge
the preconceived notions of others, and where all can speak freely. We,
thus, have a vested interest in protecting free speech. Over the 24
presidential administrations that have come and gone from Washington DC
since the Institute’s inception, Caltech has historically remained
politically neutral. But this present crisis transcends politics. It
challenges the core assumptions that students make when choosing to
entrust the Institute with their time, intellect, energy, and safety.
Simply put, this is not a moment in history when Caltech can remain
silent.</p>

<p>There is a question pulsing quietly beneath the surface of every lab
bench, every line of code, every equation scribbled onto a whiteboard:
Why are we doing this? Is it for discovery, for prestige, for the
betterment of humanity—or something more elusive? At Caltech, we pride
ourselves on pushing the boundaries of what is knowable, and we do, no
one says the opposite. We decode the stars, manipulate the quantum, edit
genes and simulate the brain. But in a world full of complexity, speed,
and ambition, can knowledge make us wise? Can science teach us how to
live well?</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-08, from: California Tech (Caltech Student

<p>Few Caltech students will take advantage of the opportunity to study
abroad during their undergraduate time here. Understandably, undergrads
are some of the busiest people you will meet here: classes throughout
the day, sports and house activities through the afternoon, problem sets
throughout the night and well into the morning, sleep if you can afford
it, rinse and repeat. Our four-year plans are often packed; graduating
on time is important when your tuition is, to say the least, exorbitant.
We are lucky if we have the sheer time management to fit in downtime,
much less plan opportunities to exit the Caltech bubble, the boundaries
of which are fortified by mediocre public transport and the expense of a
car. Throughout my freshman to junior years, I struggled intensely with
work-life balance, gradually setting goals to leave campus once a week
to control the stress associated with this place.</p>

presence of a cultural leader, who understands the cuisine and can

specifically to explore South Indian cuisine. And in so doing, I found
out just how little people actually knew about South Indian cuisine.</p>
