País aims for the U.S. with a new, American Spanish-language
edition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>For years and with various levels of success, U.S. news outlets have
tried to engage Latinos and Spanish-language audiences with new bureaus
abroad, Latino-focused verticals, new products, bilingual storytelling
and/or translations. In May, Spain’s El País took a different approach:
it launched its own digital edition to cover the United States in
Spanish instead of…</p>

launches Richmondside, its third local news site in California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Last month, I talked to Floodlight’s Miranda Green and NPR’s David
Folkenflik about how they teamed up to investigate a news site owned by
Chevron. That website was pretty much the only regular source of local
news for the city of Richmond, California, and Folkenflik and Green
called it a “news mirage” — something that…</p>

journalism’s trust problem about money, not politics?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Journalism faces a credibility crisis. Only 32% of Americans report
having “a great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in news reporting — a
historical low. Journalists generally assume that their lack of
credibility is a result of what people believe to be reporters’ and
editors’ political bias. So they believe the key to improving public
trust…</p>

espionage trial of Evan Gershkovich signals a dangerous new era for
journalism in Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The arrest and trial of U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich on spying
charges would have prompted a range of emotions in any outsider who has
been a reporter or researcher in Russia. At first, there’s the sense
that you yourself may have escaped after running a similar risk of
working in such a potentially dangerous environment. Then comes…</p>

Blog Blog aims for a sweet spot between local news and progressive

<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>When I type “local news Carrboro” into Google in early June, at first
glance, there seems to be an abundance of solid resources I can consult
about the latest happenings in the small North Carolina town. At the
top, there’s the radio station and website Chapelboro, “one of the only
distributors of local news in…</p>

has become ground zero for the vocation crisis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>This year has been a grim one for journalism, with layoffs at the Los
Angeles Times, Time magazine, NBC News, Forbes, National Geographic,
Business Insider and Sports Illustrated. Further cuts loom in newsrooms
across the U.S. Growing numbers of reporters and editors, tired of
waiting for the other shoe to drop, are exiting the profession,…</p>

sue over new rules on independent contractors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>A new rule issued by the Department of Labor earlier this year is
making some freelancers nervous, so much so that a few are challenging
it with lawsuits. The rule offers new guidance on how the agency will
determine if a worker is an employee or an independent contractor under
the Fair Labor Standards Act. Businesses…</p>
