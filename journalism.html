      <h1>UCLA men’s basketball seeks to crack Ohio State in likely free-throw battle</h1>

(date: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>Life often revolves around embracing challenging paths.
But sometimes one must take the easy points in life.
Basketball players achieve this at the free-throw line.
UCLA men’s basketball (12-5, 4-2 Big Ten) shot 21-for-21 from the charity stripe against Penn State on Wednesday on the road – the first time the squad has notched a perfect free-throw percentage since shooting 10-for-10 from the line against Utah State in last year’s NCAA tournament.</p>

      <h1>Investigation Reveals UCLA Dining Cut Pest Control Budget Ahead of Rat Infestation</h1>

(date: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>UCLA has consistently underallocated funds to pest control in its residential dining halls, despite warning signs.
The dining halls – including Feast at Rieber, De Neve Residential Restaurant, Bruin Plate and Epicuria at Covel – have not allocated sufficient money for pest control since 2017, consistently failing to increase budgets despite the departments being forced to blow through them each year.
And amid the administration’s cuts to pest control budgets, a rat infestation forced the closure of Feast in May 2025.</p>

Bob Chesney wasted no time bringing familiar faces to the West Coast.
