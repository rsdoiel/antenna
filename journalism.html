you pay to be able to quit TikTok and Instagram? You’d be surprised how
many would</h2>

<p>Social media is a problem for economists. They don’t know how to
value it. It has long been argued that it ought to be in the national
accounts as part of gross domestic product. One 2019 study estimated

The ways people hear about big news these days; “into a million pieces,”
