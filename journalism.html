      Vilma Ortiz, the former chair of the Academic Senate&#8217;s Privilege and Tenure Committee, testified Thursday. She said the committee, which reviews grievances brought by Academic Senate members who believe that their rights as faculty may have been violated, reached a split vote about whether UCLA violated academic freedom principles by placing him on leave, leading to no formal hearing.

      John Meyers, who provides vocational rehabilitation consulting services, testified Thursday that Klein earned less money following his administrative leave because of the closure of courts – where he was paid to serve as an expert witness – during the COVID-19 pandemic and general volatility in the expert witness industry.

      A court ruled Thursday that UC Regent Jay Sures must pay $150,624 of graduate student Dylan Kupsh’s legal fees after Sures unsuccessfully attempted to file a restraining order against him.&#160;
Kupsh – along with around 50 other pro-Palestine protesters – demonstrated outside Sures’ Brentwood home in February, calling him &#8220;responsible for protecting UC investments in genocide and weapons manufacturing.” Lawyers representing Sures initially alleged that Kupsh was a “ringleader” among the protesters, but were unable to prove the claim in court.

      First-generation Bruins looking to enter the legal field now have a club to call their own.
The First-Generation Pre-Law Association was founded in May and has since gained about 100 members, said Brianna Gonzalez Ulloa, the club&#8217;s co-president.

      Justine Farrell, the chair of the marketing department at the University of San Diego’s Knauss School of Business, continued her testimony Wednesday.
She said that, based on impression data from Cision, Klein’s media appearances – including him speaking about his administrative leave on Fox News multiple times – created “substantial media attention” around the situation, while the email announcing his leave which was sent to Anderson School of Management students did not.

      Mohammed Cato, the director of Title IX at UCLA, testified Tuesday about a Title IX complaint that was made against Klein.
Cato said the office did not proceed with a formal investigation because the affected parties did not want to come forward.
