<p>date: 2025-04-29, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>When it comes to putting on a performance, Rauw Alejandro is
committed to giving his fans nothing but the best. The Puerto Rican
singer-songwriter lit up the Intuit Dome on Sunday night for the second
of three shows on his “Cosa Nuestra World Tour.” With a recommended
dress code for fans that included 1960s-inspired evening gowns and
suits, the concert superseded expectations as Alejandro instead put on
what he called “A Musical Theatre Experience.” Equipped with a host, a
digital program, elaborate choreography and incredible stage sets,
Alejandro’s four-act performance told the story of the dangers of
love.</p>
