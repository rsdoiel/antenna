<p>Upon receiving an email from a student titled “An Appeal on Behalf of
Black Bruins,” Klein said he believed the student was requesting
preferential accomodations, adding that he thought it was “unlawful.”
Given the changes to online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic,
Klein said he only assigned a “simple and straightforward final exam”
during the 2020 class.</p>
