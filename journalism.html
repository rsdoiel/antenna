<p>As journalists, authors, and photographers, our work shapes how
history remembers the world. But in 2025, the fight to preserve this

<p>Journalism should be the greatest job in the world, but for many
journalists — even at top news outlets — it isn’t. Even the best

<p>For decades, the news industry has operated on a familiar rhythm:
Journalists chase scoops, publish headlines, and define the news cycle.
But a new model for information sharing is emerging. Prediction markets

<p>Years of year-end predictions reveal a journalism industry battered
about by change. Past predictions chronicle the bumpy adaptation to
economic precarity, unstable alliances with platforms, so many
technology innovations, real physical threats, and a host of other
developments that are often challenges and sometimes opportunities.

<p>The typical inverted-pyramid news article is like airplane food —
edible but to no one’s taste. Since its inception in the 1800s, the

<p>During the podcasting gold rush of the 2010s, the industry saw an
injection of capital into its middle class: the creators who did this
work professionally but who weren’t multimillionaires, those whose
success was modest, not explosive. The podcast middle class is a range
of shows operating in the $100,000 to $500,000 budget range, which…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>In 2025, attacks on journalists are set to escalate. A disturbing
global trend continues to expand: the use of criminal law to silence
journalists. This tactic, perfected by authoritarian regimes in places
like Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, China, and the Philippines, is now
spreading worldwide. Even in the United States, a Kansas newsroom faced

<p>Rather than focus on authenticity, media organizations will double
down on journalists’ humanness in its many forms. Theorists have long
lamented the lionization of an authentic self, decrying authenticity as
a mirage, an illusive social construct, a pursuit of expectations rather
than genuineness, and a trap of stereotypes that, when chased, can
promote an individualistic…</p>

<p>For as long as we’ve been talking about journalism’s credibility
crisis, we’ve been talking about one possible solution: more
transparency about how journalists do their jobs. The story goes like
this: People distrust the news because they don’t know how it gets made,
which leads to inaccurate assumptions about journalists’ motivations and

<p>There is a growing frustration in the pit of the global journalism

<p>Many newsrooms and publishers are looking for ways to use generative

<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>For many commentators, the 2024 election drove home the power of the
ever-evolving right-wing media ecosystem. There seems to be something
about the parasocial bonds that people build with media personalities
who they spend a lot of time with, and who offer stories to make sense
of day-to-day public life, that goes deeper than celebrity…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>When public media makes the news these days, it’s usually in the form
of a negative headline. Accusations of liberal bias have made
organizations like PBS and NPR the target of right-wing efforts to
defund the entire system. And reports of audience and revenue decline
have left newsroom leaders “fried and frozen,” a phrase coined…</p>

<p>Have you been on social media lately? Most Americans spend a great
deal of time there, and journalists are no different. Since social media
became mainstream, and likely even before that, journalists have spent
time on multiple platforms disseminating news and finding sources. But
the line between journalist-with-a-capital-J and content creator is
starting to blur….</p>

<p>In 2019, Wendy Dean, Simon Talbot, and Austin Dean wrote in the
journal Federal Practitioner about an increase in clinicians leaving
medicine due to “burnout.” The reality, they argued, was something
different — the reason for so many resignations was the gap between
their moral values of putting patient care first, and the inhumane
reality…</p>

<p>Journalism faces unprecedented challenges in 2025 as the intersection

<p>From the early 2010s until now, our industry saw the rise of what
I’ll call Community Engagement 1.0 — that is, consulting communities
about their information needs and genuinely serving our audiences by
delivering journalism that fills in those gaps. The earliest explanation
of this that I’ve seen is from a 2011 blog post titled…</p>

<p>This past year has been professionally gratifying, as larger local
news organizations have begun to take AI adoption seriously. They have
refocused internal resources to move beyond mere experimentation,
integrating AI-powered products into meaningful workflows. These
well-resourced newsrooms now approach AI adoption with the discipline
derived from formal product management principles and the software

<p>With the dizzying array of content creators, influencers, podcasters,

<p>I can already imagine the flood of articles we’ll see analyzing the

And I understand the concern — Trump’s return to power will indeed
