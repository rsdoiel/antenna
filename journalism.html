Erin Morrow began experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain at 20 years old.
Morrow, who is now a doctoral student in psychology at UCLA, said she consulted several doctors as an undergraduate student at Emory University before being diagnosed with a third-degree atrioventricular block – a heart rhythm disorder where the organ’s upper and lower chambers do not properly send signals to each other.

      <h1>David Geffen School of Medicine under investigation for antisemitism claims</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26, from: <a href="https://dailybruin.com/2025/08/25/david-geffen-school-of-medicine-under-investigation-for-antisemitism-claims/">The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</a>)
      <p>
      The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce announced Monday that it is investigating the David Geffen School of Medicine over antisemitism claims.&#160;
In a letter addressed to Steven Dubinett, the school’s dean, chairman Tim Walberg – a Michigan Republican – said the committee has been made aware of reports that Jewish students at the medical school experienced “hostility and fear at the hands of peers, colleagues, and administrators” and that their concerns were not addressed by the university.&#160;
He added in the letter that the committee is looking into if UCLA violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits “any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance” from discrimination based on race, color or national origin, according to the U.S.

      Since March, the Trump administration has suspended the research grants of multiple elite private universities for allegedly allowing antisemitism on their campuses.
