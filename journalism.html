      <p>Fred Ramsdell became the ninth UCLA alumnus to receive the Nobel Prize Monday.
Ramsdell, who earned his doctorate in microbiology and immunology from UCLA in 1987, received the 2025 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine alongside Mary Brunkow and Shimon Sakaguchi – who hail from the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, and Osaka University in Japan – for discoveries related to immune regulation.
The trio helped uncover how the gene Foxp3 directs the development of regulatory T cells –  specialized immune cells that prevent the body from becoming overactive and attacking its own tissues, according to the scientific journal Nature.</p>

After beating then-No. 1 Stanford in early September, a switch seemed to flip for UCLA.
The Bruins were flying high for nearly four straight weeks, sitting atop the Big Ten while raking in wins after a shaky start to the season that featured losses to then-No.</p>

Maybe it’s best that the Bruins’ first two home matches were seemingly overlooked by many.
With Thursday’s contest occurring squarely in the middle of week one for UCLA students and Saturday being UCLA football’s first contest at the Rose Bowl this academic year – No.</p>

The final pillar of the DeShaun Foster era fell Tuesday.
Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Tino Sunseri – who helped lead the Indiana offense to its first-ever College Football Playoff appearance and a school-record 11 wins last season – parted ways with UCLA, following former head coach DeShaun Foster and defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe out of Westwood.
With the Bruins’ top three coaches out the door, a power vacuum was created.</p>

      <p>UCLA football’s (0-4, 0-1 Big Ten) second season in the Big Ten promised new horizons. Instead, the Bruins find themselves in a dire situation. Their 17-14 loss against Northwestern on Saturday extended a winless start amid the removal of head coach DeShaun Foster and the departure of defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe and cemented them in the basement of the Big Ten.</p>

Mariah Carey is here for a fresh set of solid R&amp;B throwbacks on “Here For It All.”
The superstar’s sixteenth album was released Friday, with 11 tracks composing her first LP of original material since 2018’s “Caution.” The 40-minute project – complete with guest appearances from Anderson .Paak, Shenseea, Kehlani and The Clark Sisters – uses its brevity to its advantage with a tight, concise package of slick, mostly midtempo jams.</p>

      <h1>NIH temporarily reinstates suspended UCLA grants following federal judge decision</h1>

(date: 2025-09-24)
      <p>
      <em>This post was updated Sept. 25 at 3:41 p.m.</em>
Nearly two months after the federal government froze over half a billion dollars in research funding to UCLA, the National Institutes of Health has temporarily reinstated its suspended grants Tuesday – abiding by a federal judge’s Monday ruling.&#160;
Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activities Roger Wakimoto announced the restatement in a Wednesday email to the UCLA community, where he added that the majority of the university’s suspended grants have temporarily been reinstated.&#160;
The federal government suspended $584 million dollars in funding to UCLA – including $500 million from the NIH – July 30 and 31.
