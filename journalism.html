Life is eliminating our pay and reducing the spring print schedule</h2>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>“The AI era,” Sara Fischer writes in Axios, “is proving lucrative for
media publishers looking to offset a slowdown in ads and subscription
fatigue.” My prediction for 2025 is that this will not be true for most
news organizations, because they’ll find that no technology companies
are interested in paying for their content. While in…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Last November, Brazil’s first lady was involved in an unusual
altercation during the G-20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro. During a panel
about disinformation, Janja Lula da Silva was defending tougher social
media regulation when she heard a loud noise in the background. “I think
it’s Elon Musk,” she said. “I’m not afraid of you…fuck…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>We live in a time of media fragmentation and hyperpolarization. This
year’s presidential election raised further questions about traditional
media’s relevance. And it seems increasingly clear that people are
gravitating to extremes in the types of content they consume — whether
scrolling short-form posts or listening to hours-long podcasts. We must
meet them there. When…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>As we stumble into 2025, the conversation around accessibility in
journalism is more relevant than ever. As news organizations try to
engage wider and more diverse communities, accessible content isn’t just
a moral imperative — it’s also a practical one. Yet many newsrooms still
overlook even the most basic accessibility elements of publishing, even
though…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>You’ve seen them yank endorsements, sand down headlines, play both
sides, and bend the knee at Mar-a-Lago. There’s a movement in media
c-suites to get right with Donald Trump, or at least to be a little less
antagonistic. It’s going to fail, and it’s going to fail badly. News
organizations had established something of a…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The warning signs were there before the election. In October, The
Washington Post announced it would no longer endorse political
candidates. The Los Angeles Times followed suit. These weren’t
principled stands for neutrality. They were previews of how mainstream
media outlets plan to handle Trump’s second term: with kid gloves and
bothsidesism that would make…</p>

<p>In addition to working on journalism, elections, and democracy this

<p>The last few years have been plagued by the collapse of
discoverability on the internet, which have helped fuel the destruction
of many media companies’ already fragile business models. AI slop,
AI-powered bots, and tech companies’ obsession with shoving AI into
every part of their platforms have made the internet noisy and hard to
navigate….</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>To create an accurate record of history, news organizations in 2025
must become serious about the disability beat by understanding and
actively resisting ableism. That’s more crucial than ever with an
incoming president whose rhetoric falls in line with fascist logics and
beliefs and whose appointees for various health positions ramp up
chances for misinformation…</p>

<p>Is artificial intelligence ready to transform my content into other
languages with cultural precision? The answer is that it’s almost there,
and by 2025, it will reach its full potential, making now the perfect
time to develop a multilingual and multicultural strategy. Artificial

<p>If the media wants to survive, it must work on trust and represent

<p>If I’m going to predict the future, I find it useful to return to the

reasons:…</p>

<p>A significant amount of media attention and scholarship has focused

<p>As a lifelong journalist, it’s been disheartening to watch the

people will act and demand change. But I’ve spent the last few weeks

<p>Threats to journalistic independence are appearing at increasing
