Nearly two months after the federal government froze over half a billion dollars in research funding to UCLA, the National Institutes of Health has temporarily reinstated its suspended grants Tuesday – abiding by a federal judge’s Monday ruling.&#160;
Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activities Roger Wakimoto announced the restatement in a Wednesday email to the UCLA community, where he added that the majority of the university’s suspended grants have temporarily been reinstated.&#160;
The federal government suspended $584 million dollars in funding to UCLA – including $500 million from the NIH – July 30 and 31.

      UCPD arrested a suspect who allegedly stabbed a person at the Chabad House at UCLA on Friday.
Jeffrey Chobanian, the acting captain of UCPD’s operations bureau, said in a written statement that the stabbing occurred during a “roommate dispute” in a common area of the Chabad House, which is located on Gayley Avenue across from the UCLA Medical Plaza.&#160;
UCPD determined that the incident was not a hate crime, Chobanian said in the statement, although the situation is still being investigated.

      Goldberg responded to the defense&#8217;s arguments surrounding Olivia Truong – a former student of Klein’s who claimed he has a history of sending inappropriate emails – by calling the argument &#8220;a weird smear.&#8221; He added that Klein was never accused of sexual harassment and said Bernardo&#8217;s decision to suspend him was unrelated to Truong.

      Steven M. Goldberg, an attorney for Klein, said the central question in the case is Bernardo’s motivations for suspending Klein. Goldberg added that the University acted out of a desire to appear &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;appease students,&#8221; calling the move &#8220;ill-motivated&#8221; and a violation of Klein’s academic freedom.
