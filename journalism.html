      <h1>Album review: Sabrina Carpenter’s “Man’s Best Friend” lacks deft lyricism, fresh perspectives</h1>

(date: 2025-08-30, from: <a href="https://dailybruin.com/2025/08/29/album-review-sabrina-carpenters-mans-best-friend-lacks-deft-lyricism-fresh-perspectives/">The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</a>)
      <p>
      In a summer short on compelling album releases, &#8220;Man&#8217;s Best Friend&#8221; falls far short of being Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s best album.
The singer-songwriter&#8217;s seventh studio album was released Friday, arriving just over a year after her chart-topping record &#8220;Short n&#8217; Sweet.&#8221; A concise set of a dozen tracks, like its Grammy-winning predecessor, &#8220;Man&#8217;s Best Friend&#8221; continues Carpenter&#8217;s collaborations with the songwriting team of Jack Antonoff, Amy Allen and John Ryan.

      Erin Morrow began experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain at 20 years old.
Morrow, who is now a doctoral student in psychology at UCLA, said she consulted several doctors as an undergraduate student at Emory University before being diagnosed with a third-degree atrioventricular block – a heart rhythm disorder where the organ’s upper and lower chambers do not properly send signals to each other.

      <p>
      The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce announced Monday that it is investigating the David Geffen School of Medicine over antisemitism claims.&#160;
In a letter addressed to Steven Dubinett, the school’s dean, chairman Tim Walberg – a Michigan Republican – said the committee has been made aware of reports that Jewish students at the medical school experienced “hostility and fear at the hands of peers, colleagues, and administrators” and that their concerns were not addressed by the university.&#160;
He added in the letter that the committee is looking into if UCLA violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits “any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance” from discrimination based on race, color or national origin, according to the U.S.

      <p>
      Vanessa Aviva Gonz&#225;lez-Siegel, a transgender woman, could not obtain hormone replacement therapy when she first asked as an undergraduate student.
Her campus medical center did not have the treatment &#8211; making Gonz&#225;lez-Siegel one of the first people to later receive estrogen therapy at her college, she said.

      <p>
      Since March, the Trump administration has suspended the research grants of multiple elite private universities for allegedly allowing antisemitism on their campuses.
But in July, it went after UCLA, a public university that experts said has fewer resources to handle the suspension of its grants and is more wrapped up in politics as one of the flagship universities of a blue state.

      <p>
      UCLA has paused new faculty hiring and will consolidate campus information technology services following the suspension of federal research funding, two vice chancellors announced Wednesday.
In an email to faculty and staff, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Darnell Hunt and Vice Chancellor and Chief Financial Officer Stephen Agostini said the hiring review should not affect student worker positions or new faculty hires already in process.

      The UCLA School of Nursing will be renamed after Joe C. Wen, following a $30 million donation, the university announced Aug. 5.
The donation was the largest-ever gift in the nursing school&#8217;s history, which will be UCLA&#8217;s first to be named after an Asian American.
