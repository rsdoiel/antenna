      <h1>Young journalists force the industry to change — whether it’s ready or not</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>For years, the news industry has talked about Gen Z: their shifting habits, their distrust of institutions, their preference for short-form content, and their disappearing attention spans. But in 2026, the conversation will flip. Young journalists will no longer be defined by how they consume news. They will be defined by how they create it....</p>

      <p>2025 has been a year of throwing our arms up while the rollercoaster shakes us from side to side.

      <p>Media consolidation is nothing new. The late-2010s and early-pandemic years were a period of massive scale for the digital and legacy media industry, with many players filling out their portfolios in hopes of going public. We all know what happened next: sold assets, slimmer portfolios, and a cycle of seemingly, never-ending layoffs. But against all...</p>

      <p>2026 will make the last tumultuous decades in journalism look tranquil by comparison.

      <p>In 2025, advances in AI-powered code generation led to the ability to “vibe code,” i.e. create apps through prompting without even looking at the code. These vibe-coding tools lowered the cost and technical expertise required to build prototypes.

      <p>In 2025, the cracks in our shared reality metastasized into chasms. Communities are experiencing one reality, while institutions describe another. The mechanisms that once bridged the gap like trusted institutions, reliable data, and moderated platforms have collapsed or been dismantled.

      <p>Once is an accident.
Twice is a coincidence.
Thrice is a pattern.
But what does it mean when it happens 14 times?
That is the number of national championships UCLA men’s water polo has won, which accounts for over 10% of UCLA’s 125 NCAA titles.</p>

      <p>What follows is less a prediction than a hope: that the press will begin in the next year to finally recognize the true nature of its failure and begin to change the nature of the journalism it offers the public.

      <p>Much of early TV culture writing focused on helping viewers keep up, but that model is slowly giving way to a more interpretive kind of work. In 2026, the distance between culture writers and critics will narrow in ways that reshape the field. A hybrid model — one that blends reporting, interpretation, and criticism —...</p>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>UCLA has yet to play a ranked team since a late-game collapse to then-No. 5 Arizona on Nov. 14.
And in the squad’s 69-65 defeat at the hands of the Wildcats, the Bruins were outrebounded 35-28, prompting coach Mick Cronin to identify crashing the glass as a point of growth.</p>

      <h1>Dizon’s Disposition: Bruin fanbase must break cycle of hope and hate, give time for football turnaround</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>The modern sports fan hive mind lacks a backbone.
The spineless creature operates on pure emotion in place of a brain.
When things are good, things are perfect – happiness is deserved, hope is everlasting and both the people and processes that made success happen in the first place could never do anything wrong.</p>
