Americans follow local political news — but few are satisfied with the
coverage they get, a Pew report finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Do most Americans want news about local government and politics? Do
they follow news on this topic? And are they satisfied with the local
