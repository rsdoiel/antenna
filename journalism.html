<p>UCLA’s worst loss of the season came on arguably the biggest stage
the program has ever seen. It’s 51 points are the fewest it’s scored all

history as the first team to lose by more than 30 points in national

arrived anyway, with the rest of the team scoring just 25 points to
Betts’ 26.</p>

<p>FINAL: UConn 85, UCLA 51. Bruins are completely and utterly blown out
in what became their final game of the season Friday night in Tampa.
34-point loss and nothing – at all – went right for UCLA.</p>

<p>Lauren Betts, in tears, has taken to the sideline. The 2025 Naismith
Defensive Player of the Year has accounted for more than half of UCLA’s
points, while the rest of the team has struggled to gain any
momentum.</p>

trail the Huskies by 32.</p>

<p>If you told someone UCLA junior center Lauren Betts would have 23
points with four minutes remaining in the final frame and UConn guard
Paige Bueckers would have just 16, they probably wouldn’t guess the
current score – 72-43 Huskies.</p>

<p>Fans are starting to trickle out of Amalie Arena, and you hate to say
it, but justifiably so. It’s getting more and more empty by the second
as this game has fallen completely out of UCLA’s control.</p>

<p>Junior center Lauren Betts has 21 points – one point less than the
game’s leading scorer, UConn forward Sarah Strong, a freshman. Bruins
have cleaned up on turnovers, but it looks too little too late.</p>

<p>Sarah Strong has erupted for 16 points in the second half, capped off
by a nearly uncontested layup, bringing her to 22 on the game. UCLA’s
efforts to contain Paige Bueckers and Azzi Fudd have opened the door for
Strong to play at her own pace and take advantage of fast break
opportunities.</p>
