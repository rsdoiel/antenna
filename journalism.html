brings fresh questions for classic hero, disappoints with shaky
plot</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Warning: Spoilers ahead It’s got a dog! It’s narratively ambiguous!
It’s Superman! Released in theaters July 11, director James Gunn’s
latest film unravels his take on the cultural icon that is the “Man of
Steel.” Introducing a less orthodox take of the Superman origin story,
the film unusually begins with several canon Superman milestones, unlike
its predecessor films.</p>

Nothing’ encourages community and reflection through movement and
emotion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-13, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>“Super Nothing” dares audiences to reflect on challenging emotions
rather than saying “it’s nothing.” Performed for a UCLA crowd on June 13
and 14 with the school’s Center for the Art of Performance organization,
the show explored grief and the act of leaning on others for
community-based support, featuring four dancers from Los Angeles and New
York City.</p>
