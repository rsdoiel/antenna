      <p>Adversity breeds struggle.
But struggle cultivates growth.
After No. 19 UCLA men’s basketball’s (3-1) first loss of the season to then-No. 5 Arizona at the Intuit Dome – a game they led by 10 in the first half and eight with under six minutes remaining – it will have the chance to bounce back against Sacramento State (3-2) Tuesday night at Pauley Pavilion.</p>

      <p>Devon Young, a second-year mathematics student, said she has noticed food options on the Hill have been more limited since the start of the strikes, causing uncertainty concerning what times the dining halls are open.
She said while she finds the strikes understandable, she is not sure whether they will inspire change.</p>

      <h1>Album review: Summer Walker’s ‘Finally Over It’ ends trilogy of albums in lackluster manner</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>Summer Walker is closing a chapter in her career with another confessional album.
The R&amp;B singer-songwriter’s third LP, “Finally Over It,” released Nov. 14, arrived as the final entry in a trilogy that includes her 2019 debut “Over It” and her 2021 sophomore album “Still Over It.” The new project spans 55 minutes of music across 18 tracks, split evenly between two discs with the first nine songs labeled “For Better” and the second half called “For Worse.” While Walker’s honest lyrics remain engaging across the LP over a variety of nostalgic R&amp;B beats, the overabundance of 13 guest appearances never produces a collaboration on par with her best work.</p>
