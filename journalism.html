      <h1>“It’s not just younger people making the shift”: Meet Reuters’ first social-first video reporter</h1>

(date: 2025-09-18)
      <p>
      <p>Tristan Werkmeister, 26, joined Reuters as the newsroom’s first social video reporter in January. The look of Reuters’ videos hasn’t radically changed — but output has. Reuters now produces four times as many vertical videos per day as it used to. Most of the videos are straight news bulletins but occasionally Werkmeister narrates an explainer-style...</p>

      <p>
      <p>This is supposed to be a website about media innovation, so I suppose we must acknowledge the innovation of Brendan Carr, Donald Trump’s chair of the Federal Communications Commission. For decades, the renewal of television licenses was overwhelmingly pro forma; a license has been taken away because of content exactly once, when a Mississippi station...</p>

(date: 2025-09-17)
      <p>
      <p>St. Louis — When Christiaan Mader co-founded The Current Media in 2018 as a scrappy local news nonprofit for Lafayette, Louisiana, he didn’t envision events playing a big part in organizational strategy. In hindsight, he said, he should have. At a panel for LION’s Independent News Sustainability Summit in St. Louis this month, Mader shared...</p>

(date: 2025-09-15)
      <p>
      <p>The Banner, the three-year-old Maryland news nonprofit that earned national recognition with a Pulitzer win this year, is launching a news bureau in Montgomery County. The expansion into Maryland’s most populous county — where it already has several thousand paying subscribers — brings The Banner into the northern Washington suburbs, and marks its first hub...</p>

(date: 2025-09-15)
      <p>
      <p>Long before the launch of The European Correspondent, there were just two friends, one in Amsterdam, one in Basel, swapping news updates from their corners of the continent. As they traded headlines back and forth, the thought dawned on them — hey, wouldn’t it be great to have friends all over Europe, sharing news just...</p>

      <h1>Trump wants to knock prescription drug ads off of your TV (and billions out of news companies’ pockets)</h1>

(date: 2025-09-11)
      <p>
      <p>Of all of the Trump administration’s policy initiatives, this might be the one with the widest base of non-MAGA support. On Tuesday, the White House announced that it planned to make it much more difficult — likely impossible — for pharmaceutical companies to advertise their drugs on TV. You see, until 1997, drug companies were...</p>

(date: 2025-09-11)
      <p>
      <p>In 2020, as George Floyd’s killing and nationwide Black Lives Matter protests set off a “racial reckoning” in journalism, the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education (MIJE) was flooded with newsroom requests for company-wide diversity trainings. MIJE, a nonprofit founded in 1977, focuses on “equity, belonging, and diversity in news.” Martin Reynolds, the organization’s co-executive director,...</p>
