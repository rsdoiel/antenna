Gophers burrow Bruins’ lead with last-minute touchdown in Rose Bowl
loss</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Ethan Garbers wasn’t scheduled to start an hour before Saturday’s
kickoff.  But on the Bruins’ first drive, the redshirt senior
quarterback took the field.  And on UCLA’s final drive – with 27 seconds
left on the clock – Garbers was the team’s last hope.  However, the
seasoned signal-caller was depleted of his magic tricks by the fourth
quarter.  With seven seconds to play, Garbers tossed deep into the night
– and right into the hands of defensive back Koi Perich – for his third
interception of the game.  As UCLA football (1-5, 0-4 Big Ten) lived and
died by its veteran quarterback, Minnesota (4-3, 2-2) emerged victorious
21-17 at the Rose Bowl on Saturday night.  “This is a tough loss, so
this one’s going to sting a little bit,” said coach DeShaun Foster.</p>

cross country makes strides at final competition before Big Ten
Championships</h2>

<p><em>This post was updated Oct. 13 at 10:05 p.m.</em> Making a season
debut less than a month before the Big Ten championships is a risk. But
graduate student Michael Mireles and senior Mia Kane don’t seem too
concerned.</p>

<p>One of the first things UCLA athletes prepare for upon stepping foot
in Westwood is the crosstown rivalry. Freshman outside hitter Kiki Horne
is one of nine Bruins gearing up for their first battle against the
Trojans.</p>
