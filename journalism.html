is becoming the climate beat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Back in July, as I was in the middle of my morning routine of coffee
and local news, I read a headline that made me stop mid-sip: “Third
Avenue Bridge in the Bronx gets stuck due to heat, DOT says.” I live in
Brooklyn (I was, essentially, sitting next to my AC as I read…</p>

Norway’s public broadcaster overhauled its climate coverage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Four years ago, Norway’s national broadcaster set out to completely
reshape its coverage of climate change, restructuring reporters’
positions in the newsroom, and investing in producing fewer, but more
widely read, climate stories. The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation’s
dedicated climate coverage now consistently receives more views than the
rest of the newsroom’s coverage, head climate editors say….</p>

preserve their work — and drafts of history — journalists take archiving
into their own hands</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>When news sites shut down, those sites’ owners often don’t prioritize
the preservation of the content. MTV pulled down MTV News in June. After
Deadspin was sold, many of its archives temporarily disappeared. This
week, Flaming Hydra reported that The Awl’s archives are gone. And those
examples are just from the past couple of months;…</p>

longtime franchise model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Fun fact: Local news network TAPinto and Nieman Lab share a birthday
(month)! We were both founded in October 2008, in a moment of
trepidation and excitement about possibilities for news on the internet.
Two years before, in 2006, BuzzFeed had been established; in 2007, the
first iPhone had been released; and the same year…</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2022, Perplexity has staked its claim as the
generative AI disruptor of Google search. Its core product uses
conversational AI to synthesize and summarize sites and news articles
from the web in real time, rather than simply offering up a list of
links to those sites or brief article previews. With…</p>

<p>The number of digital news startup launches has been slowing since
2022 in Europe, Latin America, and North America, according to the new
Global Project Oasis report. Global Project Oasis, a research project
funded by the Google News Initiative that maps digital-native news
startups globally, cited economic challenges, slow growth, and political
conflicts as potential…</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Do most Americans want news about local government and politics? Do
they follow news on this topic? And are they satisfied with the local
political coverage they have? Those are three of the key questions a new
report from the Pew-Knight Initiative, released last week, sought to
answer. (The extreme CliffsNotes is “yes,” “yes,” and,…</p>

<p>Betting isn’t just for sports anymore. Polymarket, the
cryptocurrency-based prediction market startup that hired Nate Silver as
an advisor a couple weeks back, is beefing up its editorial offerings
ahead of the 2024 election, Semafor noted last night. Substack users can
now embed Polymarket predictions into their posts, and Polymarket has

amaBhungane has redefined investigative journalism in southern
Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>During the past 30 years of South Africa’s democratic government,
it’s hard to overstate the contribution and impact of investigative
journalism. This is perhaps most evident in its role not just in
exposing state misconduct at the highest levels, but in ensuring those
responsible have faced real, significant consequences. Muckraking
journalists were instrumental in exposing former President…</p>
