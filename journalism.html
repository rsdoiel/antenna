      <p>
      <p>Basketball coaches often prioritize teaching their pupils how to pivot with the ball.

      <p>Dance music can be as deep as the artist wants it to be, a truth Demi Lovato seems aware of.
Lovato’s ninth studio album, “It’s Not That Deep,” released Friday, marking the pop star’s first LP of new material since 2022’s rock-leaning “HOLY FVCK.” With 11 tracks – seven of which are less than three minutes long – across just over 32 minutes of music, “It’s Not That Deep” is also the singer-songwriter’s shortest album to date.</p>

UCLA and the Trump Administration have been at odds over federal funding for months.
In July, The Trump administration suspended an estimated $584 million of research funding to UCLA, alleging that the university failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students from antisemitism, implemented affirmative action in their admission practices and allegedly allowed “men to participate in women’s sports.”
While a federal judge ordered the restoration of most of the funding, the struggle breaks a long tradition of cooperation between university institutions and the federal government in research development.</p>
