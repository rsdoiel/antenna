      Dorothy Guo is not ashamed of anger.
Alongside her friend Yuwen Yang, the rising third-year theater student co-wrote, co-directed and co-produced the play &#8220;Her Rage,&#8221; which premiered at Hollywood Fringe Festival in June.

      Vilma Ortiz, the former chair of the Academic Senate&#8217;s Privilege and Tenure Committee, testified Thursday. She said the committee, which reviews grievances brought by Academic Senate members who believe that their rights as faculty may have been violated, reached a split vote about whether UCLA violated academic freedom principles by placing him on leave, leading to no formal hearing.

      John Meyers, who provides vocational rehabilitation consulting services, testified Thursday that Klein earned less money following his administrative leave because of the closure of courts – where he was paid to serve as an expert witness – during the COVID-19 pandemic and general volatility in the expert witness industry.

      A court ruled Thursday that UC Regent Jay Sures must pay $150,624 of graduate student Dylan Kupsh’s legal fees after Sures unsuccessfully attempted to file a restraining order against him.&#160;
Kupsh – along with around 50 other pro-Palestine protesters – demonstrated outside Sures’ Brentwood home in February, calling him &#8220;responsible for protecting UC investments in genocide and weapons manufacturing.” Lawyers representing Sures initially alleged that Kupsh was a “ringleader” among the protesters, but were unable to prove the claim in court.

      One of my favorite Nieman Lab predictions in recent years came from Nik Usher, associate professor of communication studies at the University of San Diego. The prediction, “The future-of-journalism crowd stops ignoring local TV news,” used the film Mean Girls as an analogy to describe local news types. Usher describes how the “freaks and geeks”...

      <p>
      Alden Global Capital sure is confused a lot lately. The vulturous hedge fund has kindly offered to pillage The Dallas Morning News, just as it&#8217;s pillaged the other newspapers it&#8217;s bought over the past decade-plus. But the paper&#8217;s owners and executives don&#8217;t seem keen on the idea! Weird, right? And now Alden is &#8220;perplexed&#8221; that...

      San Francisco crowds showed up in full force Saturday for day two of Outside Lands.
Although the festival grounds were significantly foggier than they were on Friday, festivalgoers still brought the energy as they explored new artists across a variety of stages and genres.

      Dr. Jerzy Kupiec-Weglinski has led organ transplant research at UCLA for nearly three decades.
Kupiec-Weglinski, the vice chairman of basic science research in the David Geffen School of Medicine&#8217;s surgery department, said his research centers on improving organ transplant surgery outcomes amid the growing demand for transplants as the population ages.
