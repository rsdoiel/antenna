<p>Quarterback Ethan Garbers connects with wide receiver Kwazi Gilmer to
get the first down for UCLA. Gilmer pushes his way inside the red zone
after a well-executed sling from Garbers to his young receiver.  On the
second down, Garbers hands it off to running back Keegan Jones who
stiff-arms Iowa’s defensive lineman Devan Kennedy, maneuvers through the
backfield and gets UCLA to the goal line.  But after failing to convert
on the third-and-goal, kicker Mateen Bhaghani drills the 27-yard attempt
to retake the lead.  <strong>Iowa 17, UCLA 20 | Q4 4:51</strong>
