review: ‘The Reservoir’ brings frequent laughs, which sometimes
overshadow dramatic themes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Comedy might be the best remedy, but how many jokes can be made
before the well runs dry? Since its arrival to the Westwood stage June
26, “The Reservoir” has entertained audiences with its lighthearted
humor and heartfelt intentionality, despite unfortunately skimming over
devastating topics.</p>

<p>Leslie Giovanny, who sent the original email to Klein proposing
grading accommodations for Black students in June 2020, also took the
witness stand. He said in his testimony that he did not find Klein’s
email response to be racist.  “I don’t think he said anything wrong,”
Giovanny said.</p>

<p>Laurence Shiekman, who has made recommendations on which expert
witnesses to hire for trials, was the first witness to take the stand
Tuesday. He said he would refrain from hiring Klein as an expert witness

announcement.</p>
