<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated Oct. 28 at 12:41 a.m.</em> California
voters will vote on a bond dedicated to fighting climate change this
November. Proposition 4 would authorize the state to fund $10 billion in
bonds for “water, wildfire prevention, and protection of communities and
land.” According to the California Department of General Services, a
general obligation bond is a form of long-term borrowing that the state
promises to pay back with interest.</p>
