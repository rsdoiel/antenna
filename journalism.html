un-paywalling of stories built on public data is a reminder of its role
in the information ecosystem</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The federal government does a lot of things. It lifts millions of
seniors out of poverty! It forecasts avalanches! It invades foreign
countries based on dubious intelligence! It determines what time it is!
And when it’s got a spare moment, it protects the Constitution — or at
least one copy of it. If you set…</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The “Trump bump” isn’t just for news publishers in the United States.
Last fall, four European news publishers sweetened their subscription
deals by offering complimentary access to The New York Times, with the
idea that their readers might want more expansive U.S. election
coverage. Premium subscribers to news outlets like El País (Spain),
Politiken (Denmark),…</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>On Friday, United States president Donald Trump signed an executive
order to gut the United States Agency for Global Media, the parent
organization of U.S. news agency Voice of America. More than 1,000 VOA
employees were put on indefinite paid leave on Saturday, according to
NPR. VOA and its affiliates had reached 420 million people…</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Last fall residents of Mandan, North Dakota woke up to an unfamiliar
newspaper at their doorsteps. The broadsheet Central ND News, printed on
newsprint, had columns, standard-sized articles, and headlines. But
there was an odd theme to its stories. Many referenced events that had
happened nearly a decade earlier, when protestors had swarmed the
rural…</p>

<p>Last Friday, over a thousand scientists from across Southern
California met to protest cuts to the NIH and other agencies. We take
you to the demonstration in Westwood and then we look at how students
are preparing for finals, a magic show, and the Gymnastics meet against
Stanford.</p>

<p>The sound of rain bouncing off the metallic wings overtakes the sound
of the jet engine. Instead of city lights and the Santa Monica
Mountains, the Himalayas rise up around the plane, dwarfing my
perception of altitude.</p>

<p>Above and beyond publishing journal articles, credentialing young
people and producing spectacles on the court, the field and the
gridiron, the job of a university is to keep the books.  Less visible
than some of the university’s more prominent architectural symbols, the
Michael Sadleir Collection of Nineteenth-Century British Fiction is
deeply tied to the history, and the purpose, of UCLA.</p>

<p>I am no longer allowed to buy jackets. As a chronic shopper since I
was 4 years old, my closet was stuffed with an endless supply of
jackets, vests, belts and other pieces of clothing that still had tags
on them.</p>

<p>“I was born in the greatest place on Earth.”   Pacific Palisades is
filled with spots to view the ocean sunset, but Leo Rochman’s favorite

<p>The Giving Craft shows how a small gesture can go a long way. The
student-run organization, founded this past fall quarter, is open to all
students interested in crafts – no matter the medium or level of
experience, said social media manager and second-year cognitive science
student Hannah Ngo.</p>
