      <p>
      UC faculty are proposing the creation of a multi-billion-dollar fund to support UC researchers in the wake of the federal funding suspension to UCLA.
The proposal, known as the California Futures Fund, envisions a state-level, pooled fund designed to support UC research, teaching and community service, according to a press release from the Save Our Science Initiative.

      <p>
      College football programs often begin their seasons against less elite competition to give themselves an opportunity to prepare for conference opponents.
Of the 18 Big Ten squads, just three are beginning the 2025 season against a Power Four opponent.

&#8220;Katabasis&#8221; is an intriguing book for academics but possibly a challenging journey for casual readers.

      In a summer short on compelling album releases, &#8220;Man&#8217;s Best Friend&#8221; falls far short of being Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s best album.
The singer-songwriter&#8217;s seventh studio album was released Friday, arriving just over a year after her chart-topping record &#8220;Short n&#8217; Sweet.&#8221; A concise set of a dozen tracks, like its Grammy-winning predecessor, &#8220;Man&#8217;s Best Friend&#8221; continues Carpenter&#8217;s collaborations with the songwriting team of Jack Antonoff, Amy Allen and John Ryan.

      Erin Morrow began experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain at 20 years old.
Morrow, who is now a doctoral student in psychology at UCLA, said she consulted several doctors as an undergraduate student at Emory University before being diagnosed with a third-degree atrioventricular block – a heart rhythm disorder where the organ’s upper and lower chambers do not properly send signals to each other.

      <p>
      If you were looking for a single journalistic catchphrase, you could do worse than “follow the money.” Investigating and documenting the flow of cash and other resources is almost always a worthwhile pursuit for someone trying to get to the bottom of things. Molly White, an independent journalist, software engineer, and one of the sharpest...

      It&#8217;s a tough time to be interested in archiving the web — arguably the most transient medium for news since the birth of radio. On Monday, Reddit announced it would begin blocking the Internet Archive&#8217;s Wayback Machine from crawling the site to make an archival copy. Wayback is the closest thing we have — as...

      In the most remote parts of Alaska, staying in touch can involve a bit more effort than sending a text. Cell service is spotty, highways are nonexistent, and the postal service remains a vital lifeline, delivering supplies and mail by plane. But for anyone who wants to broadcast a different kind of message — a...

      Politico has become a testing ground for how AI clauses in union contracts could shape adoption in newsrooms across the U.S. The PEN Guild represents over 250 workers at Politico and its sister publication, energy and environment site E&#38;E News. Earlier this year, the Guild alleged management had violated AI adoption guidelines negotiated into its...

      In the first federal election since news was banned on Meta platforms, Canadians lost out, a new report finds. The 2025 federal election was likely the &#8220;most poorly covered election in modern Canadian history&#8221; due to the erosion of local news and Facebook&#8217;s news ban, according to the Ottawa-based nonpartisan think tank Public Policy Forum...

      One of my favorite Nieman Lab predictions in recent years came from Nik Usher, associate professor of communication studies at the University of San Diego. The prediction, “The future-of-journalism crowd stops ignoring local TV news,” used the film Mean Girls as an analogy to describe local news types. Usher describes how the “freaks and geeks”...

      Alden Global Capital sure is confused a lot lately. The vulturous hedge fund has kindly offered to pillage The Dallas Morning News, just as it&#8217;s pillaged the other newspapers it&#8217;s bought over the past decade-plus. But the paper&#8217;s owners and executives don&#8217;t seem keen on the idea! Weird, right? And now Alden is &#8220;perplexed&#8221; that...

      The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan’s largest newspaper by circulation, has sued the generative AI startup Perplexity for copyright infringement. The lawsuit, filed in Tokyo District Court on August 7, marks the first copyright challenge by a major Japanese news publisher against an AI company. The filing claims that Perplexity accessed 119,467 articles on Yomiuri&#8217;s site between...
