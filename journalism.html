nonprofit news mix with local TV? A Pennsylvania partnership aims to
find out</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>One of my favorite Nieman Lab predictions in recent years came from

University of San Diego. The prediction, “The future-of-journalism crowd

Global Capital is still trying to get its hands on The Dallas Morning
News</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Alden Global Capital sure is confused a lot lately. The vulturous
hedge fund has kindly offered to pillage The Dallas Morning News, just
as it’s pillaged the other newspapers it’s bought over the past

the idea! Weird, right? And now Alden is “perplexed” that…</p>
