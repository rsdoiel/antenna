sentences man to 10 years in prison for July break in, assault</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>A man was sentenced to 10 years in prison Monday for breaking into
Saxon Suites and sexually assaulting a UCLA student this summer. 
Jeffrey Brewer, who is 42 years old, pleaded no contest to sexual
penetration by use of force and to burglary, and will have to pay
restitution, which will be determined at a later date, according to ABC7
Los Angeles.  Brewer was arrested in July for breaking into Saxon Suites
and was charged with one count of sexual penetration by use of force and
one count of first-degree residential burglary.  According to a July
press release from District Attorney George Gascón, Brewer was found
loitering around Saxon Suites in the early morning of July 5, where he
was briefly let into the building but was then asked to leave by a
student.</p>

are simply not enough to win at this level. Going 3-11 on third down and
0-3 on fourth down isn’t enough.</p>

<p>On his own 35, Garbers drops back to pass. Looking down the field, he
scrambles to his right. Unable to find anything with USC pressure
bearing down upon him, the redshirt senior tosses a pass in the
direction of tight end Moliki Matavao, where it sails over his head,
incomplete.</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-24, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>On fourth down on its own 34, UCLA attempted a quarterback sneak,
with redshirt senior signal-caller Ethan Garbers taking the ball
straight up the middle. Garbers was unable to reach the line to gain as
the Trojan defensive front held strong, giving USC the ball back with
only 4:59 to play and a 3-point lead.</p>

<p>This time he wouldn’t be sacked. This time USC wouldn’t be held at
the goal line. Scrambling like a madman, Jayden Maiava went
back-and-forth across the 10-yard line before firing a bullet towards
wide reciever Ja’Kobi Lane in the corner of the end zone.</p>

downfield to Kyron Hudson for a 39-yard completion.</p>

<p>Despite the heorics of J.Michael Sturdivant, the Bruin drive goes
nowhere. Garbers is sacked for the third time tonight and UCLA punts.
But that punt is shanked by redshirt sophomore Brody Richter, going only
25 yards and placing USC at their own 49-yard line.</p>

<p>USC’s leading running back – and the team’s X-factor – Woody Marks
looks to be on the ground. Redshirt senior defensive back K.J. Wallace
manages a perfectly timed blitz that brings Marks down, and should he
stay down, it’ll be a big loss for the Trojans.</p>

<p>UCLA finally put it all together on offense, scoring the first
touchdown of the game and taking its first lead. However, the lead could
have been even larger, as USC mimicked the UCLA defense and held the
home team to a field goal for its second score even after getting to the
Trojan five-yard line.</p>
