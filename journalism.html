83-year-old Voice of America</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>On Friday, United States president Donald Trump signed an executive
order to gut the United States Agency for Global Media, the parent
organization of U.S. news agency Voice of America. More than 1,000 VOA
employees were put on indefinite paid leave on Saturday, according to
NPR. VOA and its affiliates had reached 420 million people…</p>

pipeline company is suing Greenpeace for $300 million. A pay-to-play
newspaper is accused of tainting the jury pool</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Last fall residents of Mandan, North Dakota woke up to an unfamiliar
newspaper at their doorsteps. The broadsheet Central ND News, printed on
newsprint, had columns, standard-sized articles, and headlines. But
there was an odd theme to its stories. Many referenced events that had
happened nearly a decade earlier, when protestors had swarmed the
rural…</p>

The Steps Episode 7: Scientists walk out to protest funding cuts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Last Friday, over a thousand scientists from across Southern
California met to protest cuts to the NIH and other agencies. We take
you to the demonstration in Westwood and then we look at how students
are preparing for finals, a magic show, and the Gymnastics meet against
Stanford.</p>

Nepal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>The sound of rain bouncing off the metallic wings overtakes the sound
of the jet engine. Instead of city lights and the Santa Monica
Mountains, the Himalayas rise up around the plane, dwarfing my
perception of altitude.</p>

Century</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Above and beyond publishing journal articles, credentialing young
people and producing spectacles on the court, the field and the
gridiron, the job of a university is to keep the books.  Less visible
than some of the university’s more prominent architectural symbols, the
Michael Sadleir Collection of Nineteenth-Century British Fiction is
deeply tied to the history, and the purpose, of UCLA.</p>

<p>I am no longer allowed to buy jackets. As a chronic shopper since I
was 4 years old, my closet was stuffed with an endless supply of
jackets, vests, belts and other pieces of clothing that still had tags
on them.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>“I was born in the greatest place on Earth.”   Pacific Palisades is
filled with spots to view the ocean sunset, but Leo Rochman’s favorite
is a cul-de-sac at the bottom of the hill in the bluffs overlooking the
coast.</p>

Giving Craft gives more than gifts to patients, encouraging creativity
at UCLA</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>The Giving Craft shows how a small gesture can go a long way. The
student-run organization, founded this past fall quarter, is open to all
students interested in crafts – no matter the medium or level of
experience, said social media manager and second-year cognitive science
student Hannah Ngo.</p>

nostalgic television programs and original concepts to craft vibrant
stories.</p>
