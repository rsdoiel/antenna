      Goldberg responded to the defense&#8217;s arguments surrounding Olivia Truong – a former student of Klein’s who claimed he has a history of sending inappropriate emails – by calling the argument &#8220;a weird smear.&#8221; He added that Klein was never accused of sexual harassment and said Bernardo&#8217;s decision to suspend him was unrelated to Truong.

      Sandra McDonough, an attorney for the UC Regents and Bernardo, said the publicity from Klein’s email was enough to damage his reputation alone. She added that screenshots of Klein’s emails received around 18 million impressions across platforms before Bernardo informed the School of Management that Klein would be put on leave.

      Steven M. Goldberg, an attorney for Klein, said the central question in the case is Bernardo’s motivations for suspending Klein. Goldberg added that the University acted out of a desire to appear &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;appease students,&#8221; calling the move &#8220;ill-motivated&#8221; and a violation of Klein’s academic freedom.

      The trial concluded with closing arguments from both sides. Klein’s attorney said Bernardo’s emails misrepresented Klein and hurt his ability to attract new clients, adding that Madsen’s estimate of damages was conservative.

      <p>
      The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce announced Monday that it is investigating the David Geffen School of Medicine over antisemitism claims.&#160;
In a letter addressed to Steven Dubinett, the school’s dean, chairman Tim Walberg – a Michigan Republican – said the committee has been made aware of reports that Jewish students at the medical school experienced “hostility and fear at the hands of peers, colleagues, and administrators” and that their concerns were not addressed by the university.&#160;
He added in the letter that the committee is looking into if UCLA violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits “any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance” from discrimination based on race, color or national origin, according to the U.S.
