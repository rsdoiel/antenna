more nonprofit newsrooms announce content sharing agreements with the
AP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-28, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>In March, newspaper chains Gannett and McClatchy stopped using
Associated Press wire reports and photos to cut costs. Just a few days

sharing partnership, it would gain access to the AP’s Texas stories
and…</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-28, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>At the Institute for Nonprofit News’ first full-day topical
conference at CUNY’s Craig Newmark School of Journalism last week, INN
members came together for a shared exploration of the challenges facing

people more likely to accurately evaluate misinformation when the

<p>Imagine you’re walking down the street and a random guy asks you to
solve a math problem. A complicated one, but one you know how to solve —
it’d just take several minutes of some fairly serious thinking on your

<p>In an era when people trust news less than ever, how can journalists

that simple headlines significantly increase article engagement and
clicks compared with…</p>
