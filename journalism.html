And in the squad’s 69-65 defeat at the hands of the Wildcats, the Bruins were outrebounded 35-28, prompting coach Mick Cronin to identify crashing the glass as a point of growth.</p>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>The modern sports fan hive mind lacks a backbone.
The spineless creature operates on pure emotion in place of a brain.
When things are good, things are perfect – happiness is deserved, hope is everlasting and both the people and processes that made success happen in the first place could never do anything wrong.</p>

      <p>For the past decade, YouTube creators have spent their time trying to look less like journalists and more like entertainers.

      <p>From Instagram Reels to TikTok, one pattern stands out: People follow people, not “the newsroom” as an abstract idea.

      <p>Gambling devoured sports media, and it only took about ten years. It seems clear that something similar is under way with politics coverage, too, with the rise of prediction markets. And I think this time it goes faster. A narrow and true story about prediction markets as they relate to our understanding of politics is...</p>
