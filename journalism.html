      <p>When Rhea Parameswaran left her hometown of Bangalore, she missed three things: her family, the food and the films.
That love for Indian cinema inspired her to co-found the Indian Cinema Collective (ICC) – a UCLA club that explores Indian cinema through film screenings, panels and guest speaker events.</p>

      <p>I was 6 years old when I went to Wrigley Field to watch the Chicago Cubs in 2012.
Growing up in the city, I’d hear about the mystique of the now-111-year-old “Friendly Confines” – the ivy covering the brick outfield wall, the manual scoreboard in center field and the rooftop bleachers on nearby Lake View buildings.</p>

A loss – even to a top-10 team – would reverse the dominant tone for the season the squad had established with its first two victories.
But an efficient second half quelled any glimmer of an upset over No.</p>

Despite the absence of former five-star prospect and starting signal caller Dylan Raiola, true freshman quarterback TJ Lateef led Nebraska (7-3, 4-3 Big Ten) to a 28-21 victory over UCLA (3-6, 3-3) in Pasadena on Saturday during the Bruins’ annual Family Weekend game.</p>

(date: 2025-11-09)
      <p>
      <p>The California Supreme Court stood by a lower court’s ruling that the UC cannot bar undocumented students from holding on-campus jobs Oct. 29.
A lawsuit alleged that the UC’s rule preventing undocumented students from working on-campus jobs violates the California Fair Employment and Housing Act – which says that it is illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or applicants on the basis of their immigration status – according to court documents.</p>

      <h1>Album review: Demi Lovato’s ‘It’s Not That Deep’ fails to cut deep with bland, derivative songs</h1>

(date: 2025-10-26)
      <p>
      <p>Dance music can be as deep as the artist wants it to be, a truth Demi Lovato seems aware of.
Lovato’s ninth studio album, “It’s Not That Deep,” released Friday, marking the pop star’s first LP of new material since 2022’s rock-leaning “HOLY FVCK.” With 11 tracks – seven of which are less than three minutes long – across just over 32 minutes of music, “It’s Not That Deep” is also the singer-songwriter’s shortest album to date.</p>
