      <title>Enhancing repository integration with Crossref</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/enhancing-repository-integration-with-crossref/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Repositories are home to a wide range of scholarly content; they often archive theses, dissertations, preprints, datasets, and other valuable outputs. These records are an important part of the research ecosystem and should be connected to the broader scholarly record. But to truly serve their purpose, repository records need to be connected to each other, to the broader research ecosystem, and to the people behind the research. Metadata is what makes that possible. Enhancing metadata is a way to tell a fuller, more accurate story of research. It helps surface relationships between works, people, funders, and institutions, and allows us as a community to build and use a more connected, more useful network of knowledge - what Crossref calls the ‘<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/" target="_blank">Research Nexus</a>’.</p>
        <p>The challenge many repositories face is that metadata can be incomplete, inconsistent, or disconnected. Think of references without DOIs, authors without ORCID iDs, or research outputs that aren&rsquo;t linked to funding. To address this, Crossref provides a range of services that repositories can use to improve the quality and interoperability of their metadata. Our REST API, which is openly and publicly accessible, allows repositories to retrieve structured metadata, such as DOIs, references, abstracts, contributors, ORCID iDs, and funder information, that can be used to enrich and update their local records. For repository members, with the Cited-by service and reference linking, repositories can also show how works are being cited and interconnect related content. The Grant Linking Service (GLS) enables the clear indication of which research outputs are linked to specific funding, and funding bodies themselves are connected using Open Funder Registry and ROR, adding another layer of context. With Crossmark, repositories can flag updates, corrections, or retractions to ensure transparency and trust in the scholarly content they host.</p>
        <p>Enriching repository metadata using Crossref is a practical and empowering step toward making your records more discoverable, complete, and connected. The process is simple, and you don’t need to be a developer to get started. Repositories can query the Crossref REST API using a DOI or basic metadata like a title or author name, and receive structured, reliable information. This can include full author lists, ORCID iDs, reference lists, funding data, and licensing terms. You can then match and merge this data into your repository records. Adding Crossref DOIs to your metadata enables persistent linking, helping users trace research outputs back to their stewards. It also helps create rich relationships between articles, datasets, software, grants, and other research objects. All of this supports the FAIR principles and contributes to a more connected and reusable scholarly record. And because Crossref’s infrastructure is open, any repository can access and use this metadata to improve the quality, visibility, and long-term value of their collections.</p>
        <h3 id="steps-to-enrich-repository-metadata-with-crossref">Steps to enrich repository metadata with Crossref:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Query the REST API using DOIs or basic metadata (visit our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/learning/" target="_blank">API learning hub</a> to learn how to use the Crossref API)</li>
        <li>Retrieve structured metadata like authors, ORCID iDs, funders, affiliations, ROR IDs, licenses, grants, and references</li>
        <li>Map and merge with your local records</li>
        <li>Display persistent links to all kinds of research objects using Crossref DOIs</li>
        <li>Support FAIR by including open, structured, and complete metadata</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Across the repository community, several institutions are already integrating Crossref metadata in meaningful ways to enrich their records and improve discoverability. DSpace users can enrich their deposits by using the platform’s <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/Live&#43;Import&#43;from&#43;external&#43;sources" target="_blank">“Live Import” feature</a>, which allows them to pull in Crossref metadata, such as titles, authors, and DOIs, directly into items during the submission process. A deeper integration between DSpace and Crossref is currently in development. HAL in France uses the Crossref API to complete and standardise references, making its content more consistent and connected (hal.archives-ouvertes.fr). SciELO, a key open access platform in Latin America, leverages Crossref DOI links and citation metadata to strengthen the visibility of its journals (<a href="https://scielo.org" target="_blank">scielo.org</a>). In Canada, the University of Saskatchewan’s eCommons repository queries the Crossref API to enhance metadata accuracy and link records to the broader scholarly graph (ecommons.usask.ca). The Apollo repository at the University of Cambridge uses Crossref to connect theses and articles to their published versions, creating a clearer picture of research outcomes (repository.cam.ac.uk). Zenodo, hosted by CERN, draws on Crossref metadata to link deposited datasets and software with related publications, supporting transparency and reuse (<a href="https://zenodo.org/" target="_blank">zenodo.org</a>).</p>
        <p>These examples show how even modest integrations with Crossref can lead to substantial gains in metadata quality, interoperability, and global discoverability. Altogether, these activities and organisations are enhancing the Research Nexus, enriching a scholarly graph for the benefit of all.</p>

You can explore the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/enhancing-repository-integration-with-crossref-services.pdf">presentation slides (PDF)</a> from <strong>Open Repositories 2025</strong>, which cover the Crossref API and its capabilities, how repositories can use it to query and enrich metadata, the benefits for repository managers, researchers, and funders, as well as recent updates to our metadata schema.</p>]]>

      <title>Piecing together the Research Nexus: uncovering relationships with open funding metadata</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/piecing-together-the-research-nexus-uncovering-relationships-with-open-funding-metadata/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The Crossref <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Grant Linking System (GLS)</a> has been facilitating the registration, sharing and re-use of open funding metadata for six years now, and we have reached some important milestones recently! What started as an interest in identifying funders through the Open Funder Registry evolved to a more nuanced and comprehensive way to share and re-use open funding data systematically. That’s how, in collaboration with the funding community, the Crossref Grant Linking System was developed. Open funding metadata is fundamental for the transparency and integrity of the research endeavour, so we are happy to see them included in the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">Research Nexus</a>.</p>
        <p>As emphasised recently by <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69" target="_blank">Hans de Jonge from NWO</a>, funding metadata’s value is in the transparency of the relationships it enables. The system is powered by the collective action of the research community– including research funders – that registers open metadata with Crossref, making these relationships possible. With close to 180,000 grant records in our corpus we wanted to know how far they reach and what story they tell.</p>
        <p>In March 2022, we <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/ske16-xve54" target="_blank">developed an approach for linking grants to research outputs</a> and analysed how many such relationships could be established. Now we’re able to present <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/aexidu9f" target="_blank">the latest dataset</a> that contains relationships between grants and research outputs, both those deposited by Crossref members and discovered by an automated matching strategy. It includes data deposited up to the end of July 2025.</p>
        <p>This work is part of our ongoing <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/">Metadata Matching</a> project.</p>
        <h2 id="what-exactly-is-in-this-new-open-dataset-of-grantoutput-relationships">What exactly is in this new open dataset of grant&lt;&gt;output relationships?</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The dataset contains 250,163 total funding relationships between grants and research outputs. </li>
        <li>We welcomed a number of funders, such as the <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69" target="_blank">Dutch Research Council</a> and <a href="https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/persistent-unique-identifiers-doi/" target="_blank">Fonds de Recherche du Quebec</a>, which together registered almost 27,000 grants in the past year. </li>
        <li>It’s clear that the more grant metadata is registered the more funding relationships we can uncover. </li>
        <li>The percentage of relationships that are registered explicitly by Crossref members providing grants IDs in funding information has grown from less than 0.1% in 2023 to 1% (modest numbers but amazing growth!).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-methodology">The methodology </h3>
        <p>We created <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/aexidu9f" target="_blank">a dataset of relationships between grants and research outputs</a> by analysing their metadata in several ways. A relationship is included in the dataset if at least one of the following conditions is met:</p>

Open funding metadata plays a central role in building a transparent, accountable and high integrity research environment by making visible the connections between the funding, grantees, research outputs, and their impact. Funders’ openness mandates and Open Science commitments emphasize the importance of traceability in the research process, so ensuring that the support given-whether financial or otherwise-can be systematically recorded and shared is instrumental.

At the same time, initiatives such as the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information</a> underscores the benefits of open, reusable funding metadata for monitoring, evaluation and assessment of research and researchers.</p>

        <p>Crossref houses millions of records, from the ubiquitous research articles and preprints, to books, peer review records, technical reports, datasets – you name it. Our members not only register, but also regularly update their metadata as new or corrected information becomes available. Our matching workflows allow us to make visible the hidden relationships and complete and improve the metadata records by adding new and reciprocal assertions.</p>
        <p>This analysis shows the unique value of registering funding metadata with Crossref and adding an essential piece to the Research Nexus puzzle. <strong>The relationship metadata allows the funding that underpins the research process to be connected, and contextualise scattered data points, acting as an anchor that links publications, people, and other research outputs.</strong> This is made possible by the impressive number of records continuously being registered by more than 23,000 member organisations, and by the increasing availability of funding information in the system with more research funders joining in and registering their grant metadata with us.</p>
        <h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
        <p>As we welcome more and more funders to the GLS, we, collectively, continue to complete the Research Nexus, record by record, field by field. The more awards we have in our corpus the more relationships we’ll uncover, so we’ll keep making these analyses periodically to make sure we don’t miss them.</p>
        <p>But it is not all on us. We are working towards a vision where Crossref Grant IDs are business as usual – where funders register their awards, grantees are aware of them and share them with publishers, and those publishers share them back with us when registering their content – closing the loop organically. We continue working on making this easier. In the upcoming works schema update a specific Crossref Grant ID field will be added in the funding information, alongside Award ID (for an internal identifier).</p>
        <p>Crucially, as the momentum of adoption among funders increases, and thousands of Crossref Grant IDs are available in the system, we are working with all members to raise their attention to the importance and desirability of funding metadata, so inclusion of that information in metadata of all works increases and consequently, the percentage of relationships asserted by Crossref members can grow.</p>
        <p>This matching analysis is just one example of what we do to enrich metadata to highlight relationships among works, individuals, institutions, and actions. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/">we launched the Metadata Matching project</a>, which is a major effort to rebuild our matching workflows using modern software development and data science practices. As part of the project, we plan to expose additional matched relationships between grants and research outputs in our REST API, alongside those deposited by our members. We’ll keep you updated as we go along!</p>

      <source:markdown>The Crossref [Grant Linking System (GLS)](https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/) has been facilitating the registration, sharing and re-use of open funding metadata for six years now, and we have reached some important milestones recently! What started as an interest in identifying funders through the Open Funder Registry evolved to a more nuanced and comprehensive way to share and re-use open funding data systematically. That’s how, in collaboration with the funding community, the Crossref Grant Linking System was developed. Open funding metadata is fundamental for the transparency and integrity of the research endeavour, so we are happy to see them included in the [Research Nexus](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/).

As emphasised recently by [Hans de Jonge from NWO](https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69), funding metadata’s value is in the transparency of the relationships it enables. The system is powered by the collective action of the research community– including research funders – that registers open metadata with Crossref, making these relationships possible. With close to 180,000 grant records in our corpus we wanted to know how far they reach and what story they tell.

In March 2022, we [developed an approach for linking grants to research outputs](https://doi.org/10.64000/ske16-xve54) and analysed how many such relationships could be established. Now we’re able to present [the latest dataset](https://doi.org/10.13003/aexidu9f) that contains relationships between grants and research outputs, both those deposited by Crossref members and discovered by an automated matching strategy. It includes data deposited up to the end of July 2025.

This work is part of our ongoing [Metadata Matching](https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/) project.

## What exactly is in this new open dataset of grant&#60;&#62;output relationships?

- The dataset contains 250,163 total funding relationships between grants and research outputs.
- We welcomed a number of funders, such as the [Dutch Research Council](https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69) and [Fonds de Recherche du Quebec](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/persistent-unique-identifiers-doi/), which together registered almost 27,000 grants in the past year.
- It’s clear that the more grant metadata is registered the more funding relationships we can uncover.
- The percentage of relationships that are registered explicitly by Crossref members providing grants IDs in funding information has grown from less than 0.1% in 2023 to 1% (modest numbers but amazing growth!).

### The methodology

We created [a dataset of relationships between grants and research outputs](https://doi.org/10.13003/aexidu9f) by analysing their metadata in several ways. A relationship is included in the dataset if at least one of the following conditions is met:

- A relationship was explicitly deposited by a Crossref member through a _finances_ or _isFinancedBy_ [relationship](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/markup-guide-metadata-segments/relationships/): 488 (0.2%) relationships
- The research output contains the grant DOI within the award number in the funding metadata: 2,003 (0.8%) relationships
- The award numbers in the grant and the research output are similar, and the associated funding organisations are either the same, or one is the sub-organisation of the other: 247,672 (99%) relationships

The dataset includes data deposited until the end of July 2025 and contains 250,163 total relationships.

The code used to generate the dataset is available [in our GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/crossref/data-science/matching-tools/-/tree/main/grant_matching/offline_dataset?ref_type=heads).

### The results

As you can see in the graph below, the number of relationships grant-research output continues to grow as the number of grants records Crossref members register with us increases.

![Graph of the number of relationships grant-research output](https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/graph-grant-research-output.png)

**Figure 1:** Cumulative totals of grants, linked grants, research outputs, and grant–research output relationships from 2019 to 2025. Stepwise increases correspond to the addition of major funder datasets, including Wellcome (2020), OSTI (2021), JST (2022), the European Union (2022), the Austrian Science Fund (2023), and the Fonds de recherche du Québec (2025).

Looking at the numbers broken down by grant registrants we can see that the more grants registered the more relationships can be uncovered. The table below shows funders who have at least 1,000 total grants registered and for whom at least 10% of their registered grants are linked to research outputs, showing the number of relationships, grants, linked grants and linked research outputs (sorted by the percentage of linked grants), and compared with the data from the 2023 analysis (where available) to see how the uptake of open funding metadata is evolving.

We encourage funders to join as members once they have determined the means of effective implementation of the GLS within their processes. By further analysing metadata of matched outputs, funders have the opportunity to monitor compliance with their policies and learn more about the impact of their programs.

### Following through funders’ Open Science commitments

The relationships showcased above and in the recent analysis are powered by open funding metadata. Open funding metadata plays a central role in building a transparent, accountable and high integrity research environment by making visible the connections between the funding, grantees, research outputs, and their impact. Funders’ openness mandates and Open Science commitments emphasize the importance of traceability in the research process, so ensuring that the support given-whether financial or otherwise-can be systematically recorded and shared is instrumental. Openness is also part of the strategic plans of institutions such as the International Science Council, who has [explicitly called for greater transparency in funding](https://council.science/blog/fighting-disinformation-with-sunshine-promoting-funding-transparency-in-science/) as a way to strengthen trust in science and counter misinformation. At the same time, initiatives such as the [Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information](https://barcelona-declaration.org/) underscores the benefits of open, reusable funding metadata for monitoring, evaluation and assessment of research and researchers.

Crossref’s Grant Linking System offers funders’ a way to demonstrate a commitment to openness, modeling the standards they expect of the research community they support, while creating a more robust, trustworthy and collaborative research ecosystem.

### Economy of scale: unlocking relationships with Crossref

Crossref houses millions of records, from the ubiquitous research articles and preprints, to books, peer review records, technical reports, datasets – you name it. Our members not only register, but also regularly update their metadata as new or corrected information becomes available. Our matching workflows allow us to make visible the hidden relationships and complete and improve the metadata records by adding new and reciprocal assertions.

This analysis shows the unique value of registering funding metadata with Crossref and adding an essential piece to the Research Nexus puzzle. **The relationship metadata allows the funding that underpins the research process to be connected, and contextualise scattered data points, acting as an anchor that links publications, people, and other research outputs.** This is made possible by the impressive number of records continuously being registered by more than 23,000 member organisations, and by the increasing availability of funding information in the system with more research funders joining in and registering their grant metadata with us.

### Next steps

As we welcome more and more funders to the GLS, we, collectively, continue to complete the Research Nexus, record by record, field by field. The more awards we have in our corpus the more relationships we’ll uncover, so we’ll keep making these analyses periodically to make sure we don’t miss them.

But it is not all on us. We are working towards a vision where Crossref Grant IDs are business as usual – where funders register their awards, grantees are aware of them and share them with publishers, and those publishers share them back with us when registering their content – closing the loop organically. We continue working on making this easier. In the upcoming works schema update a specific Crossref Grant ID field will be added in the funding information, alongside Award ID (for an internal identifier).

Crucially, as the momentum of adoption among funders increases, and thousands of Crossref Grant IDs are available in the system, we are working with all members to raise their attention to the importance and desirability of funding metadata, so inclusion of that information in metadata of all works increases and consequently, the percentage of relationships asserted by Crossref members can grow.

This matching analysis is just one example of what we do to enrich metadata to highlight relationships among works, individuals, institutions, and actions. Earlier this year, [we launched the Metadata Matching project](https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/), which is a major effort to rebuild our matching workflows using modern software development and data science practices. As part of the project, we plan to expose additional matched relationships between grants and research outputs in our REST API, alongside those deposited by our members. We’ll keep you updated as we go along!

      <title>Innovation in scientific publishing and its implications for Crossref DOI registration practices - Request for input</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/innovation-in-scientific-publishing-and-its-implications-for-crossref-doi-registration-practices-request-for-input/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><em>Lots of exciting innovations are being made in scientific publishing, often raising fundamental questions about established publishing practices. In this guest post, Ludo Waltman and André Brasil discuss the recently launched MetaROR publish-review-curate platform and the questions it raises about good practices for Crossref DOI registration in this emerging landscape.</em></p>
        <p>Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique identifiers commonly assigned to research outputs such as journal articles, preprints, peer review reports, and datasets. The DOI of a research output allows the output to be identified online in a persistent way, even when the underlying publishing infrastructure changes (e.g., a journal moving from one publisher to another).</p>
        <p>There are several DOI registration agencies. Most of the larger scientific publishers work with Crossref, and so do many preprint servers, and therefore our focus in this post is on Crossref. Crossref also keeps track of <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5_v2" target="_blank">metadata associated with research outputs</a>, such as the title, authors, and publication date of an output, and it makes this metadata openly available via APIs for all kinds of services to ingest and reuse. Because indexing, discovery, and evaluation tools rely heavily on this metadata, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration/">content registration practices</a> and metadata design choices can have major effects on the visibility and findability of research outputs and on analytics used to monitor and assess research outputs and their contributors.</p>
        <p>For the most common types of research outputs, such as journal articles and preprints, a broad consensus has emerged over the past decades on good practices for DOI registration. Such consensus means that articles are assigned the record type ‘article’ in their Crossref metadata. Likewise, many preprint servers register DOIs for preprints at Crossref, with the record type ‘preprint’ in the metadata. (The arXiv preprint server is an exception; it registers DOIs for preprints with DataCite rather than Crossref.)</p>
        <p>For innovative new publication platforms, however, good practices for DOI registration are less clear.

      <source:markdown>_Lots of exciting innovations are being made in scientific publishing, often raising fundamental questions about established publishing practices. In this guest post, Ludo Waltman and André Brasil discuss the recently launched MetaROR publish-review-curate platform and the questions it raises about good practices for Crossref DOI registration in this emerging landscape._

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique identifiers commonly assigned to research outputs such as journal articles, preprints, peer review reports, and datasets. The DOI of a research output allows the output to be identified online in a persistent way, even when the underlying publishing infrastructure changes (e.g., a journal moving from one publisher to another).

There are several DOI registration agencies. Most of the larger scientific publishers work with Crossref, and so do many preprint servers, and therefore our focus in this post is on Crossref. Crossref also keeps track of [metadata associated with research outputs](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5_v2), such as the title, authors, and publication date of an output, and it makes this metadata openly available via APIs for all kinds of services to ingest and reuse. Because indexing, discovery, and evaluation tools rely heavily on this metadata, [content registration practices](https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration/) and metadata design choices can have major effects on the visibility and findability of research outputs and on analytics used to monitor and assess research outputs and their contributors.

For the most common types of research outputs, such as journal articles and preprints, a broad consensus has emerged over the past decades on good practices for DOI registration. Such consensus means that articles are assigned the record type ‘article’ in their Crossref metadata. Likewise, many preprint servers register DOIs for preprints at Crossref, with the record type ‘preprint’ in the metadata. (The arXiv preprint server is an exception; it registers DOIs for preprints with DataCite rather than Crossref.)

For innovative new publication platforms, however, good practices for DOI registration are less clear. The approaches to scientific publishing offered by these platforms often do not fit neatly into established ways of working. For instance, for some of these platforms, the traditional distinction between peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals and non-peer-reviewed articles posted on preprint servers is no longer applicable. This raises fundamental questions about suitable DOI registration practices for new approaches to scientific publishing.

## MetaROR

The [MetaROR (MetaResearch Open Review) platform](https://metaror.org/), launched in November 2024 by the Research on Research Institute (RoRI) and the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science (AIMOS), offers an example of the challenge of developing appropriate DOI registration practices for new publishing models.

Inspired by similar initiatives such as [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/) and others, MetaROR adopts the so-called [publish-review-curate model](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/h7swt). Authors first publish their article on a preprint server and then submit it to MetaROR. MetaROR then organizes an open peer review process for the article. Review reports are published on the MetaROR platform, along with a copy of the preprinted article and an editorial assessment. Rather than a simple binary decision (accept vs. reject), an editorial assessment is a short one-paragraph statement summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of an article. Each review report and each editorial assessment has its own DOI registered at Crossref. In this way, review reports are treated as first-class research outputs that can, for instance, be indexed in scientific literature databases and can be cited in other research outputs.

For an article submitted to MetaROR, the publication of the review reports, the editorial assessment, and a copy of the article itself concludes MetaROR’s publish-review-curate process. The authors of the article may revise their work in light of the feedback received, and MetaROR may review the revised article. However, there is no requirement that revisions must be made. The primary aim of the review reports and the editorial assessment published on the MetaROR platform is to offer context for readers of the article, helping readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the article.

## Crossref DOI registration

[Registration of DOIs](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/peer-reviews/) for open peer review reports is [increasingly common](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-growth-of-open-peer-review). By registering Crossref DOIs for review reports and editorial assessments, MetaROR enables reviewers and editors to be recognized for their contributions. But what about recognition for authors?

A crucial element in MetaROR’s philosophy is that authors of articles peer-reviewed by MetaROR deserve to be recognized in a similar way as authors of articles published in traditional peer-reviewed journals. One way to promote appropriate recognition for authors of articles peer-reviewed by MetaROR is to ensure that articles on the MetaROR platform, just like articles in peer-reviewed journals, [have their own DOI](https://www.openscience.nl/en/cases/the-metaror-publish-review-curate-model-our-experience-as-authors). While this may seem straightforward to arrange, it actually raises two non-trivial questions about good practices for Crossref DOI registration:

1. For each article on the MetaROR platform, there is a corresponding article on a preprint server. Is it acceptable to have two Crossref DOIs, one registered by the preprint server and one registered by the MetaROR platform, for essentially the same article?
2. If Crossref DOIs are registered for articles on the MetaROR platform, should the articles be assigned the type ‘article’ or the type ‘preprint’ in their Crossref metadata, or something else entirely?

On the first question, it could be argued that having [two Crossref DOIs for the same article](https://doi.org/10.64000/xjgnq-a3p05) is problematic and that MetaROR, therefore, should not register DOIs for articles on its platform. Alternatively, one could argue that an article on the MetaROR platform differs in a meaningful way from the corresponding article on a preprint server, since the article on the MetaROR platform has been enriched with peer review reports and an editorial assessment, similar to the way an article in a peer-reviewed journal may be seen as an enriched version of the corresponding article on a preprint server. This line of reasoning would justify registering DOIs for articles on the MetaROR platform.

On the second question, the argument could be made that articles on the MetaROR platform should be assigned the type ‘preprint’ in their Crossref metadata, since the type ‘article’ is intended for articles in journals and MetaROR does not consider itself to be a journal (in fact, MetaROR works with [partner journals](https://cms.metaror.org/partner-journals/) to enable articles peer-reviewed by MetaROR to be published in journals) and does not certify articles in the way journals do (i.e., MetaROR does not make accept/reject decisions). On the other hand, one could argue that articles on the MetaROR platform should be assigned the type ‘article’, since the peer-reviewed nature of articles in journals is typically seen as the key factor distinguishing these articles from articles on preprint servers. Articles on the MetaROR platform have been peer-reviewed, and in that sense, they resemble articles in journals. A third line of reasoning could be that neither the ‘preprint’ nor the ‘article’ type is fully appropriate for articles on the MetaROR platform and, consequently, that there is a need for a new Crossref record type.
