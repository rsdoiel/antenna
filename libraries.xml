      <title>Crossref at the Frankfurt Book Fair 2025</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-at-the-frankfurt-book-fair-2025/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The Frankfurt Book Fair is the largest book fair in the world, and therefore a key event on our calendar. Held annually in Frankfurt, Germany, the 77th Frankfurt Book Fair (October 15–19, 2025) saw 118,000 trade visitors and 120,000 private visitors from 131 countries. The Crossref booth was located, as usual, in Hall 4.0 where all the stands with information about academic publishing can be found. Four Crossref colleagues attended the Book Fair this year, and in this blog post, you can read more about their meetings, experiences, and plans. </p>

        <p>Even though I’ve been working in scholarly comms for over 10 years, I’d never had a chance to visit the Frankfurt Book Fair. I was therefore really excited to have an opportunity to attend this year, and it didn’t disappoint! I arrived on Monday, October 13, in time for the STM dinner, which proved a great opportunity to meet with Crossref members and collaborators. On Tuesday, I attended the <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/events/stm-dinner-conference-2025-frankfurt/" target="_blank">STM conference</a> with the exciting theme of ‘The role of publishers in science diplomacy’. I think my favorite part of the day was the last panel, where the panelists realised that even though they represent different groups, in the end, they all have the same goals and are all working towards better science and dissemination. </p>
        <p>On Wednesday, it was time to head over to our booth, where we prepared for the interesting conversations ahead. My meetings were mainly focused on collaborations in the area of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/research-integrity/">research integrity</a>, as Crossref plans to run pilots with potential partners next year. In-person meetings at the fair were a good opportunity to discuss in more detail which kinds of integrity checks could be useful to our members. I also had several meetings with organizations functioning as <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/service-providers/">Service Providers</a> –– depositing content on behalf of members –– who are eagerly awaiting the launch of our renewed Service Providers program next year. In these conversations, we shared our thinking about requirements for Crossref Service Providers and got input from organizations with experience serving our member community. Overall, it was a great opportunity to see members and collaborators in person, and I’ve already put the 2026 Frankfurt Book Fair in my calendar!</p>
        <h3 id="an-exciting-comeback---maryna">An exciting comeback - Maryna</h3>
        <p>If last year, I was a debutante at the Frankfurt Book Fair, 2025 marked an exciting comeback. It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to spend time chatting with people you usually only meet through email or Zoom. Working remotely as part of a global team is something I truly value about Crossref, but it also makes those in-person moments even more special. You get to solve issues that have been sitting on your to-do list over lunch, brainstorm ideas while walking to the venue, get immediate advice in a meeting—and, of course, talk about dogs over dinner.</p>
        <p>Frankfurt was busy but well organised. Our booth was lively with a mix of planned and spontaneous meetings. It was nice to reconnect with members and sponsors I&rsquo;ve worked with over the years. We even gave an early look at the new <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/">Participation Reports</a> before the official release (what a thrill!). There were good conversations about <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/deprecating-co-access-crossref-plans-and-timelines/">deprecating co-access</a>, the importance of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/creating-and-managing-dois/transferring-responsibility-for-dois/">title transfers</a>, and how we can keep improving the member experience. One highlight: I spoke with a prospective member about our membership model and fee structure, and they joined the following week! Their account is already active, with a prefix assigned, which was great to see.</p>
        <p>Another key topic was the importance of <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR IDs</a>. I talked with several publishers about how they could be implemented across other systems. At one point, I spotted an issue with unregistered DOIs and was able to fix it on the spot by finalising a title transfer—we&rsquo;d had permission but never received the formal request—so it was satisfying to close that loop in real time.</p>
        <p>Being a relatively small team serving a global membership of more than 23,000 and growing, it&rsquo;s not possible to meet with every member face-to-face to respond to every question. Our team works hard to respond to all queries by email, but it&rsquo;s undeniably faster and more productive in person. That&rsquo;s why we keep returning to the Frankfurt Book Fair year after year—you can definitely count on seeing us again next year! </p>
        <h3 id="third-time-at-bat---luis">Third time at bat - Luis</h3>
        <p>The Frankfurt Book Fair is always an incredible opportunity to connect with our community. We come prepared with highlights of the year, plans for developments and upcoming releases, and remind the members we meet to participate and vote in the annual elections. But most of what we learn happens during the informal moments––meetings, drop-ins, and chats over coffee and tea––where people discuss what they’re working on, trends, and interests of the scholarly and publishing community. </p>
        <p>This year, some of those conversations included meeting someone working with groups from Egypt and the UAE who are developing tools around our metadata. They wanted to talk through REST API use, recent Crossref updates, and how retraction metadata could fit into their systems. Another person opened their participation report with us and were surprised to see their metadata showing 0% despite the team believing they were sending complete metadata, which led to a discussion about getting their internal workflows running again. </p>
        <p>Booth days always fly by, but they’re deeply informative and insightful for teams that participate in person, as we can “cross-check” (pun intended) how our different support mechanisms help the community and how well we&rsquo;re delivering our communications. There is a good mix of problem-solving and catching-up; often, we see members who prepare a list of questions because they find it easier to sit and navigate through them with our support or membership colleagues. Sometimes it’s about refreshing their understanding of what Crossref is and what we do, especially during team changes. We also spoke with a publisher <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark">preparing to adopt Crossmark</a>. They wanted to check they were handling updates and relationships correctly, and mentioned that increasing transparency is becoming a priority for them. Someone else, working closely with a repository, asked about using the REST API or Metadata Plus to enrich their records. </p>
        <p>A few visitors simply needed clarity––one was pleased to learn they could register reports and datasets after being told otherwise. Another visitor who registers a small number of book DOIs each year asked whether <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/web-deposit-form/">the Web Deposit Form</a> was still the best fit. We walked through the Record Registration Form together, and its new editing features helped them plan for upcoming changes.</p>
        <p>Personally, I enjoy seeing the cultural and organisational diversity of existing and potential Crossref members, ambassadors, sponsors, allies and colleagues from all over the world at our booth. If you have the opportunity to attend the Book Fair next year, please visit our booth and say hello!</p>
        <h3 id="this-years-frankfurt-veteran---paul">This year’s Frankfurt Veteran - Paul</h3>
        <p>I think this is my 5th (?) Frankfurt book fair,  and each year I come away thinking how much I appreciate the opportunity to speak with our members face to face, and I get to see and hear the impact that Crossref has, which is always such a pleasure.</p>
        <p>This year, there were only four of us in attendance, and it felt busier than ever. We had a lot of pre-booked meetings at our wonderfully designed booth again (thanks to the amazing work of our colleague Rosa) but we also had lots of ad-hoc meetings, where members came up to say “hello”, “thank you” or ask about that really knotty, niche problem that they have, which they are not sure how to explain over email. From a technical support perspective, this is great, as we can go through these issues and get a resolution––or a solid background––without the delay and confusion of long email threads.

It’s had a visual update as well as some new functionality: you can download a gap report that lists DOI numbers of records that are missing the metadata element you choose, making it easier to identify and update missing metadata. I always like attending the Frankfurt Book Fair and so might be there next year. It&rsquo;s an important opportunity for all Crossref colleagues to engage and meet our members––many for the first time. </p>

      <source:markdown>The Frankfurt Book Fair is the largest book fair in the world, and therefore a key event on our calendar. Held annually in Frankfurt, Germany, the 77th Frankfurt Book Fair (October 15–19, 2025) saw 118,000 trade visitors and 120,000 private visitors from 131 countries. The Crossref booth was located, as usual, in Hall 4.0 where all the stands with information about academic publishing can be found. Four Crossref colleagues attended the Book Fair this year, and in this blog post, you can read more about their meetings, experiences, and plans.

### First timer fun at the Frankfurt Fair - Helena

Even though I’ve been working in scholarly comms for over 10 years, I’d never had a chance to visit the Frankfurt Book Fair. I was therefore really excited to have an opportunity to attend this year, and it didn’t disappoint! I arrived on Monday, October 13, in time for the STM dinner, which proved a great opportunity to meet with Crossref members and collaborators. On Tuesday, I attended the [STM conference](https://stm-assoc.org/events/stm-dinner-conference-2025-frankfurt/) with the exciting theme of ‘The role of publishers in science diplomacy’. I think my favorite part of the day was the last panel, where the panelists realised that even though they represent different groups, in the end, they all have the same goals and are all working towards better science and dissemination.

On Wednesday, it was time to head over to our booth, where we prepared for the interesting conversations ahead. My meetings were mainly focused on collaborations in the area of [research integrity](https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/research-integrity/), as Crossref plans to run pilots with potential partners next year. In-person meetings at the fair were a good opportunity to discuss in more detail which kinds of integrity checks could be useful to our members. I also had several meetings with organizations functioning as [Service Providers](https://www.crossref.org/community/service-providers/) –– depositing content on behalf of members –– who are eagerly awaiting the launch of our renewed Service Providers program next year. In these conversations, we shared our thinking about requirements for Crossref Service Providers and got input from organizations with experience serving our member community. Overall, it was a great opportunity to see members and collaborators in person, and I’ve already put the 2026 Frankfurt Book Fair in my calendar!

### An exciting comeback - Maryna

If last year, I was a debutante at the Frankfurt Book Fair, 2025 marked an exciting comeback. It’s always a pleasure to spend time chatting with people you usually only meet through email or Zoom. Working remotely as part of a global team is something I truly value about Crossref, but it also makes those in-person moments even more special. You get to solve issues that have been sitting on your to-do list over lunch, brainstorm ideas while walking to the venue, get immediate advice in a meeting—and, of course, talk about dogs over dinner.

Frankfurt was busy but well organised. Our booth was lively with a mix of planned and spontaneous meetings. It was nice to reconnect with members and sponsors I’ve worked with over the years. We even gave an early look at the new [Participation Reports](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/) before the official release (what a thrill!). There were good conversations about [deprecating co-access](https://www.crossref.org/blog/deprecating-co-access-crossref-plans-and-timelines/), the importance of [title transfers](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/creating-and-managing-dois/transferring-responsibility-for-dois/), and how we can keep improving the member experience. One highlight: I spoke with a prospective member about our membership model and fee structure, and they joined the following week! Their account is already active, with a prefix assigned, which was great to see.

Another key topic was the importance of [ROR IDs](https://ror.org/). I talked with several publishers about how they could be implemented across other systems. At one point, I spotted an issue with unregistered DOIs and was able to fix it on the spot by finalising a title transfer—we’d had permission but never received the formal request—so it was satisfying to close that loop in real time.

Being a relatively small team serving a global membership of more than 23,000 and growing, it’s not possible to meet with every member face-to-face to respond to every question. Our team works hard to respond to all queries by email, but it’s undeniably faster and more productive in person. That’s why we keep returning to the Frankfurt Book Fair year after year—you can definitely count on seeing us again next year!

### Third time at bat - Luis

The Frankfurt Book Fair is always an incredible opportunity to connect with our community. We come prepared with highlights of the year, plans for developments and upcoming releases, and remind the members we meet to participate and vote in the annual elections. But most of what we learn happens during the informal moments––meetings, drop-ins, and chats over coffee and tea––where people discuss what they’re working on, trends, and interests of the scholarly and publishing community.

This year, some of those conversations included meeting someone working with groups from Egypt and the UAE who are developing tools around our metadata. They wanted to talk through REST API use, recent Crossref updates, and how retraction metadata could fit into their systems. Another person opened their participation report with us and were surprised to see their metadata showing 0% despite the team believing they were sending complete metadata, which led to a discussion about getting their internal workflows running again.

Booth days always fly by, but they’re deeply informative and insightful for teams that participate in person, as we can “cross-check” (pun intended) how our different support mechanisms help the community and how well we’re delivering our communications. There is a good mix of problem-solving and catching-up; often, we see members who prepare a list of questions because they find it easier to sit and navigate through them with our support or membership colleagues. Sometimes it’s about refreshing their understanding of what Crossref is and what we do, especially during team changes. We also spoke with a publisher [preparing to adopt Crossmark](https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark). They wanted to check they were handling updates and relationships correctly, and mentioned that increasing transparency is becoming a priority for them. Someone else, working closely with a repository, asked about using the REST API or Metadata Plus to enrich their records.

A few visitors simply needed clarity––one was pleased to learn they could register reports and datasets after being told otherwise. Another visitor who registers a small number of book DOIs each year asked whether [the Web Deposit Form](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/web-deposit-form/) was still the best fit. We walked through the Record Registration Form together, and its new editing features helped them plan for upcoming changes.

Personally, I enjoy seeing the cultural and organisational diversity of existing and potential Crossref members, ambassadors, sponsors, allies and colleagues from all over the world at our booth. If you have the opportunity to attend the Book Fair next year, please visit our booth and say hello!

### This year’s Frankfurt Veteran - Paul

I think this is my 5th (?) Frankfurt book fair,  and each year I come away thinking how much I appreciate the opportunity to speak with our members face to face, and I get to see and hear the impact that Crossref has, which is always such a pleasure.

This year, there were only four of us in attendance, and it felt busier than ever. We had a lot of pre-booked meetings at our wonderfully designed booth again (thanks to the amazing work of our colleague Rosa) but we also had lots of ad-hoc meetings, where members came up to say “hello”, “thank you” or ask about that really knotty, niche problem that they have, which they are not sure how to explain over email. From a technical support perspective, this is great, as we can go through these issues and get a resolution––or a solid background––without the delay and confusion of long email threads. I also worked with a member who got their IT department to send over a file there and then for us to work through and try to navigate a difficult question regarding reference matching and whether the [simple text query form](https://doi.crossref.org/simpleTextQuery) worked using an API, which others could use. These were just two examples of many in which it was much easier to sit down and work through issues directly at the fair.

So I would always say that if you are at the Frankfurt book fair, and you have one of these issues then it is a great opportunity to come by, say hello and work through it with us. We will send out a reminder before the fair in 2026 to get any meetings booked, or just come find us at the fair.

A highlight for me this year was also showing some of our members our [new Participation Report](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/). It’s had a visual update as well as some new functionality: you can download a gap report that lists DOI numbers of records that are missing the metadata element you choose, making it easier to identify and update missing metadata. I always like attending the Frankfurt Book Fair and so might be there next year. It’s an important opportunity for all Crossref colleagues to engage and meet our members––many for the first time.

### Next year

Feeling inspired after all the great meetings and conversations we had this year, we immediately started planning for next year! We’ll definitely be in Frankfurt in 2026, where you can find our team at the Crossref booth. We’re also planning to organize another roundtable on the Monday before the fair, so put October 5-9, 2026, in your calendars and stay tuned for more details.</source:markdown>

      <title>The sunset is on the horizon for Metadata Manager. What&#39;s next?</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-sunset-is-on-the-horizon-for-metadata-manager.-whats-next/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>TL;DR. Metadata Manager will be retired at the end of 2025. Over the past four years, we have been developing a new helper tool to replace it, and that tool has now reached a stage of maturity that means we will be able to switch off Metadata Manager by the end of the year.</p>
        <h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h2>
        <p>In 2021, we <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/30vzx-r5x16" target="_blank">said</a> that we would be retiring the deprecated <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/metadata-manager/">Metadata Manager</a> as soon as we can offer members a suitable replacement for registering their journal content. So this news has been a long time coming - Metadata Manager has been very challenging for us to support, and we have found it impossible to develop additional features. However, we did not want to take the final step of switching off the interface until we were able to offer a suitable replacement for members who rely on manual helper tools to register their journal content.</p>
        <p>That replacement, our new <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/record-registration-form/">record registration form</a>, has now been used by many members for over a year to register their journal content. The feedback so far has been positive, and we have been able to add functionality to the tool at a pace that we are happy with.</p>
        <p>In July 2025, we contacted those members who are still using Metadata Manager to let them know that the tool will no longer be available after December 2025. So if you are affected by this news, you were probably already aware of it. But we wanted to go into a little more detail on the sunsetting of Metadata Manager, why we are doing it, and what’s next for Crossref’s content registration helper tools.</p>
        <h2 id="what-has-happened-since-2021">What has happened since 2021?</h2>
        <p>We have been developing the record registration form ever since that announcement in 2021. It began its life as a helper tool for registering grant records, but we knew we wanted to expand it to cover journal articles and other record types as soon as we could.</p>
        <p>To see whether the concept behind the grants form could be applied to journal content, we first built an initial prototype and tested it with a number of Crossref ambassadors and volunteers. We wanted to ensure that the tool was intuitive to use, and to understand what functionality it would need to support for it to be truly useful to our members. Following some iteration on the invaluable feedback we received from our testers, we finally released the tool to production in September 2024 and began encouraging members to use it for their real-life article deposits.</p>
        <p>We have been continuously adding new functionality since then, from additional fields for registering richer metadata to a feature that allows members to edit their articles’ metadata without having to re-enter everything into the form.</p>
        <p>Now, about two months from the target date for retiring Metadata Manager, the record registration form is used by members to register about 200 articles per day, while Metadata Manager still sees about double that volume of submissions. So we have some way left to go.</p>
        <h2 id="why-is-now-the-right-time-to-retire-metadata-manager">Why is now the right time to retire Metadata Manager?</h2>
        <p>2025 has been a year of addressing technical debt for Crossref. My colleague Sara wrote about this co-ordinated push towards modernising our system in her post about our <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/wd6rx-vpq73" target="_blank">cloud migration</a> in the summer.</p>
        <p>Having the long-awaited replacement for Metadata Manager in place will allow us to free up the resources that have been tied up for years by troubleshooting Metadata Manager, in terms of both technology and user support, so that we can focus on projects and initiatives that align with our longer-term <a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy/">strategy</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="how-will-we-avoid-the-new-tool-developing-the-same-problems-as-metadata-manager">How will we avoid the new tool developing the same problems as Metadata Manager?</h2>
        <p>As stated above, Metadata Manager has caused us many issues and headaches in different ways - but we have also learned a lot from dealing with these problems. As Bryan Vickery <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/1a52b-7pf27" target="_blank">wrote in 2020</a>, Metadata Manager is “not flexible enough to easily add other record types, like books/book chapters, or to include any changes we may make to our input schema.” To address this, we built the record registration form in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvq2e-q8t24" target="_blank">schema-driven way</a>, which makes it adaptable to any future schema changes. It also means that we can spin up prototypes of new forms for additional record types quite quickly.</p>
        <p>So while Metadata Manager was custom-built in a way that could only ever work for journal content, the record registration form already supports two record types and will support more in future. This is key for our goal of building a complete <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">research nexus</a>, which extends far beyond journal content, and even beyond “content” as such (did someone say <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">grants</a>?).</p>
        <h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Metadata Manager will no longer be available from January 2026.</li>
        <li>Starting next year, if you attempt to access Metadata Manager at <a href="https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/" target="_blank">https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/</a>, you will be redirected to a deprecation note on <a href="https://www.crossref.org/deprecated/" target="_blank">https://www.crossref.org/deprecated/</a> which will link out to the new tool.</li>

        <p>If your organisation still uses Metadata Manager to register metadata for your journal articles, now is a good time to begin familiarising yourself with the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/choose-content-registration-method/">alternatives</a> available to you from 2026 forward - these include, but are not limited to, the new record registration form.</p>
        <h3 id="if-your-journal-has-an-issn">If your journal has an ISSN</h3>
        <p>We recommend you begin using the record registration form as soon as possible. Simply go to <a href="https://manage.crossref.org/records" target="_blank">https://manage.crossref.org/records</a> and sign in with your Crossref account credentials to register a journal article. You can also see a list of all the journal article records you have previously registered using our manual helper tools at <a href="https://manage.crossref.org/records/edit" target="_blank">https://manage.crossref.org/records/edit</a> and edit their metadata using the form.</p>
        <p>To help you make the switch from Metadata Manager, we will be hosting an interactive webinar on 13 November about how to transition to the new tool. <a href="https://crossref.zoom.us/webinar/register/7317600554084/WN_WF1Ykk-4SKeih4ucpTeesA" target="_blank">Register here</a> or look out for the recording, which will be shared in our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/archive/" target="_blank">events archive</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="if-your-journal-does-not-have-an-issn">If your journal does not have an ISSN</h3>
        <p>The record registration form currently only supports ISSNs as journal identifiers. Title-level and volume/issue-level DOIs, which are at the core of how Metadata Manager handles journal metadata, have been the cause for some of the problems we have had over the years with that particular tool. Also, Crossref DOIs have always been intended primarily as citation identifiers, and entire journals/volumes/issues are very rarely cited. For that reason, we built the Record Registration Form such that it doesn&rsquo;t support registering or using journal-level DOIs.</p>
        <p>With that being said, if you do not (yet) have an ISSN for your journal for whatever reason, you can use our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/web-deposit-form/">web deposit form</a> to register your articles with journal DOI. If you do obtain an ISSN for your title later on, you can then simply begin using the record registration form from that point onward.</p>
        <h2 id="how-will-the-new-tool-continue-to-be-developed">How will the new tool continue to be developed?</h2>
        <p>We will continue to work with our members and community to develop additional functionalities for the journal article form. Currently we are working on allowing <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/principles-practices/best-practices/relationships/">relationships metadata</a> to be registered using the form.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the goal is for the record registration form to become the one-stop shop for members who manually register and update their metadata. To this end, we are working on expanding the tool to cover additional record types - we have recently developed a prototype for registering books and chapters, and we will be looking to test this in the coming months with volunteers who are currently registering their book metadata via other avenues such as the web deposit form.</p>

      <source:markdown>TL;DR. Metadata Manager will be retired at the end of 2025. Over the past four years, we have been developing a new helper tool to replace it, and that tool has now reached a stage of maturity that means we will be able to switch off Metadata Manager by the end of the year.

## How did we get here?

In 2021, we [said](https://doi.org/10.64000/30vzx-r5x16) that we would be retiring the deprecated [Metadata Manager](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/metadata-manager/) as soon as we can offer members a suitable replacement for registering their journal content. So this news has been a long time coming - Metadata Manager has been very challenging for us to support, and we have found it impossible to develop additional features. However, we did not want to take the final step of switching off the interface until we were able to offer a suitable replacement for members who rely on manual helper tools to register their journal content.

That replacement, our new [record registration form](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/record-registration-form/), has now been used by many members for over a year to register their journal content. The feedback so far has been positive, and we have been able to add functionality to the tool at a pace that we are happy with.

In July 2025, we contacted those members who are still using Metadata Manager to let them know that the tool will no longer be available after December 2025. So if you are affected by this news, you were probably already aware of it. But we wanted to go into a little more detail on the sunsetting of Metadata Manager, why we are doing it, and what’s next for Crossref’s content registration helper tools.

## What has happened since 2021?

We have been developing the record registration form ever since that announcement in 2021. It began its life as a helper tool for registering grant records, but we knew we wanted to expand it to cover journal articles and other record types as soon as we could.

To see whether the concept behind the grants form could be applied to journal content, we first built an initial prototype and tested it with a number of Crossref ambassadors and volunteers. We wanted to ensure that the tool was intuitive to use, and to understand what functionality it would need to support for it to be truly useful to our members. Following some iteration on the invaluable feedback we received from our testers, we finally released the tool to production in September 2024 and began encouraging members to use it for their real-life article deposits.

We have been continuously adding new functionality since then, from additional fields for registering richer metadata to a feature that allows members to edit their articles’ metadata without having to re-enter everything into the form.

Now, about two months from the target date for retiring Metadata Manager, the record registration form is used by members to register about 200 articles per day, while Metadata Manager still sees about double that volume of submissions. So we have some way left to go.

## Why is now the right time to retire Metadata Manager?

2025 has been a year of addressing technical debt for Crossref. My colleague Sara wrote about this co-ordinated push towards modernising our system in her post about our [cloud migration](https://doi.org/10.64000/wd6rx-vpq73) in the summer.

Having the long-awaited replacement for Metadata Manager in place will allow us to free up the resources that have been tied up for years by troubleshooting Metadata Manager, in terms of both technology and user support, so that we can focus on projects and initiatives that align with our longer-term [strategy](https://www.crossref.org/strategy/).

## How will we avoid the new tool developing the same problems as Metadata Manager?

As stated above, Metadata Manager has caused us many issues and headaches in different ways - but we have also learned a lot from dealing with these problems. As Bryan Vickery [wrote in 2020](https://doi.org/10.64000/1a52b-7pf27), Metadata Manager is “not flexible enough to easily add other record types, like books/book chapters, or to include any changes we may make to our input schema.” To address this, we built the record registration form in a [schema-driven way](https://doi.org/10.64000/cvq2e-q8t24), which makes it adaptable to any future schema changes. It also means that we can spin up prototypes of new forms for additional record types quite quickly.

So while Metadata Manager was custom-built in a way that could only ever work for journal content, the record registration form already supports two record types and will support more in future. This is key for our goal of building a complete [research nexus](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/), which extends far beyond journal content, and even beyond “content” as such (did someone say [grants](https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/)?).

## What happens next?

- Metadata Manager will no longer be available from January 2026.
- Starting next year, if you attempt to access Metadata Manager at [https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/](https://www.crossref.org/metadatamanager/), you will be redirected to a deprecation note on [https://www.crossref.org/deprecated/](https://www.crossref.org/deprecated/) which will link out to the new tool.

## What options do I have for registering my journal content going forward?

If your organisation still uses Metadata Manager to register metadata for your journal articles, now is a good time to begin familiarising yourself with the [alternatives](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/choose-content-registration-method/) available to you from 2026 forward - these include, but are not limited to, the new record registration form.

### If your journal has an ISSN

We recommend you begin using the record registration form as soon as possible. Simply go to [https://manage.crossref.org/records](https://manage.crossref.org/records) and sign in with your Crossref account credentials to register a journal article. You can also see a list of all the journal article records you have previously registered using our manual helper tools at [https://manage.crossref.org/records/edit](https://manage.crossref.org/records/edit) and edit their metadata using the form.

To help you make the switch from Metadata Manager, we will be hosting an interactive webinar on 13 November about how to transition to the new tool. [Register here](https://crossref.zoom.us/webinar/register/7317600554084/WN_WF1Ykk-4SKeih4ucpTeesA) or look out for the recording, which will be shared in our [events archive](https://www.crossref.org/events/archive/).

### If your journal does not have an ISSN

The record registration form currently only supports ISSNs as journal identifiers. Title-level and volume/issue-level DOIs, which are at the core of how Metadata Manager handles journal metadata, have been the cause for some of the problems we have had over the years with that particular tool. Also, Crossref DOIs have always been intended primarily as citation identifiers, and entire journals/volumes/issues are very rarely cited. For that reason, we built the Record Registration Form such that it doesn’t support registering or using journal-level DOIs.

With that being said, if you do not (yet) have an ISSN for your journal for whatever reason, you can use our [web deposit form](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/web-deposit-form/) to register your articles with journal DOI. If you do obtain an ISSN for your title later on, you can then simply begin using the record registration form from that point onward.

## How will the new tool continue to be developed?

We will continue to work with our members and community to develop additional functionalities for the journal article form. Currently we are working on allowing [relationships metadata](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/principles-practices/best-practices/relationships/) to be registered using the form.

Ultimately, the goal is for the record registration form to become the one-stop shop for members who manually register and update their metadata. To this end, we are working on expanding the tool to cover additional record types - we have recently developed a prototype for registering books and chapters, and we will be looking to test this in the coming months with volunteers who are currently registering their book metadata via other avenues such as the web deposit form.

If you would like to support these efforts, or you have begun using the new tool and would like to share your feedback, come join the discussion in our [community forum](https://community.crossref.org/t/feedback-on-new-helper-tool/1721).

      <title>Announcing changes to REST API rate limits</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/announcing-changes-to-rest-api-rate-limits/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/">REST API</a> makes all of the metadata we hold publicly available. It receives the majority of our API traffic, with around 1 billion hits per month. It’s one of the key ways that we fulfil our mission to make research objects easy to find, cite, link, assess, and reuse. From 1 December 2025, we will be revising the rate limits for the public and polite pools of the REST API to ensure that we can maintain a stable and reliable system, and that metadata is freely available to everyone.</p>
        <p>We haven’t changed the rate limits since the REST API was launched in 2013. In the past five years, the number of requests to the REST API has tripled and the number of metadata records has increased by a third, from 120 million to around 180 million. This means an increase in the resources needed to run it, and we’ve seen periods of instability where we haven’t been able to keep the API available for all users. We have decided that it is the right time to revisit rate limits to check that they’re in line with what our technology can provide and what our community needs. As a result, we will apply the following for the public and polite pools:</p>
        <p>Public pool:</p>
        <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
        <th>Request type</th>
        <th>Rate limit</th>
        <th>Concurrency limit</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td>Single record</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>List of records (queries, filters, etc.)</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Polite pool:</p>
        <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
        <th>Request type</th>
        <th>Rate limit</th>
        <th>Concurrency limit</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td>Single DOI record</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>List of records (queries, filters, etc.)</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The rate limit is the number of total requests that can be made per second. The concurrency limit is how many requests can be running at the same time. This means that for longer-running requests you may need to wait for previous requests to finish before you can make a new one.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of single records requests:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.1002/cphy.cp010129" target="_blank">https://api.crossref.org/v1/works/10.1002/cphy.cp010129</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://api.crossref.org/v1/journals/0266-612X&amp;mailto=my@email.com" target="_blank">https://api.crossref.org/v1/journals/0266-612X&mailto=my@email.com</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second case here will be directed to the polite pool because an email is included using the ‘mailto’ parameter. And here are examples of requests that return lists of records:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://api.crossref.org/v1/works?filter=from-created-date:2025-10-21T16:20,until-created-date:2025-10-21T17:00" target="_blank">https://api.crossref.org/v1/works?filter=from-created-date:2025-10-21T16:20,until-created-date:2025-10-21T17:00</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://api.crossref.org/v1/members/13/works&amp;mailto=my@email.com" target="_blank">https://api.crossref.org/v1/members/13/works&mailto=my@email.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://api.crossref.org/v1/works?query.bibliographic=linear&#43;dichroism&amp;mailto=my@email.com" target="_blank">https://api.crossref.org/v1/works?query.bibliographic=linear+dichroism&mailto=my@email.com</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second and third examples here will use the polite pool.</p>
        <p>Our guiding principle in making these changes is to keep all of the metadata available to everyone, all of the time. These changes to rate limits won’t restrict current users from accessing the metadata they want to retrieve, but it will make it easier for us to maintain the system now and in the future.</p>
        <h2 id="which-use-cases-do-we-support">Which use cases do we support?</h2>
        <p>Our metadata has a broad range of applications. If you’re someone who uses the REST API, we’re glad that you are part of our community! Our mission includes making it easier to find, reuse, and assess scholarly research outputs. By using metadata, you’re helping us to fulfil that goal.</p>
        <p>The main uses of the REST API fit into several categories. The new rate limits will continue to support these, among many others:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I have some metadata, what is the DOI?</li>
        <li>I have a DOI, what is its metadata?</li>
        <li>I want all of the metadata, just give me everything.</li>
        <li>Research on a specific topic or subset of metadata, often refreshing the results every few weeks or months.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rate limits can encourage responsible usage. The majority of API users make requests at a low rate and will not need to make any changes, however a few send spikes of large numbers of requests in a short space of time, sometimes making it difficult for others to access the service. These can be smoothed out by lower rate limits. Complex requests that search across large numbers of items put more pressure on our systems than requests for a single content item, so we have decided to set different rate limits for different types of request.</p>
        <h2 id="who-will-be-affected">Who will be affected?</h2>
        <p>We estimate that the changes might affect around 40 users per week across the public and polite pools, and this is only for some of their requests. In all of the cases we’ve seen, the rate of requests could be slowed down and users would still be able to get the same results. In other words, the aim of these changes is to make the load on the API more predictable, not to reduce the total number of requests or amount of metadata transferred. No changes are being made to the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus/">Metadata Plus</a> service or other APIs, such as the XML API and OAI-PMH endpoint.</p>
        <h2 id="do-i-need-to-change-how-i-use-the-api">Do I need to change how I use the API?</h2>
        <p>If you’re reading this, thank you! It’s clear that you want to be a considerate user of our services. Almost all users can continue to use the REST API in exactly the same way, you won’t need to change anything. Here is some general advice that will help you make the most of the service and ensure that you won’t encounter issues.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Use a mailto parameter. This gives you access to the polite pool meaning higher rate limits and meaning we can get in touch with you if needed. We’ll only use your address to contact you about your API requests.</li>
        <li>Check the HTTP response status for your requests. This is always good practice and can help you identify malformed requests and where you reach rate limits.</li>
        <li>Cache results to avoid repeatedly making the same requests. Most records don’t change on a regular basis. How often you update the cache will depend on what you are interested in, but most metadata fields rarely change.</li>
        <li>If you are making a very high volume of requests or have very complex analysis to carry out, consider downloading the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/learning/public-data-file/">public data file</a> which is made available once a year and contains all of our metadata. You can update it with recent additions using the REST API.</li>
        <li>If you are relying on our metadata in a production service, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus/">Metadata Plus</a> can provide more stability, support, and access to monthly snapshots of our entire database.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We have more <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-the-crossref-rest-api/">tips and tricks</a> for the REST API in our documentation. If you have questions, please join the conversation on our Community Forum.</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>Our [REST API](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/) makes all of the metadata we hold publicly available.

Public pool:

Request typeRate limitConcurrency limitSingle record51List of records (queries, filters, etc.)11

Polite pool:

The rate limit is the number of total requests that can be made per second. The concurrency limit is how many requests can be running at the same time. This means that for longer-running requests you may need to wait for previous requests to finish before you can make a new one.

Here are some examples of single records requests:

The second and third examples here will use the polite pool.

      <title>Celebrating Noyam Journals’ Metadata Award</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/celebrating-noyam-journals-metadata-award/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://noyam.org/" target="_blank">Noyam Journals</a>, based in Accra, Ghana, was recently recognised for the completeness of its metadata through the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-metadata-awards/" target="_blank">Crossref Metadata Award</a>, part of our 25th anniversary celebrations. Noyam was one of six publishers worldwide to receive the award and stood out as a leader among members of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/" target="_blank">Global Equitable Membership</a> (GEM) Program.</p>
        <p>The GEM Program supports publishers and organisations in low- and middle-income countries to participate in the global scholarly community by reducing barriers to membership and services.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, at our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/reflections-from-crossref-accra-2025-strengthening-open-science-and-partnerships-in-ghana/" target="_blank">Crossref Accra event</a>, representatives from Noyam spoke about how registering metadata with Crossref has expanded their readership worldwide. They also encouraged other publishers and institutions in Africa to utilise Crossref’s infrastructure to enhance the visibility and impact of their work.</p>
        <p>Following their award, we spoke with Naa Kai Amanor-Mfoafo from Noyam Journals about their approach to metadata quality. She shares her reflections in the Q&amp;A below.</p>
        <h2 id="what-motivates-your-team-to-work-towards-high-quality-metadata">What motivates your team to work towards high-quality metadata?</h2>
        <p>Our commitment towards high-quality metadata stems from our organisational goal to promote the dissemination of usable knowledge by publishing innovative and high-quality research content.

      <source:markdown>[Noyam Journals](https://noyam.org/), based in Accra, Ghana, was recently recognised for the completeness of its metadata through the [Crossref Metadata Award](https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-metadata-awards/), part of our 25th anniversary celebrations. Noyam was one of six publishers worldwide to receive the award and stood out as a leader among members of our [Global Equitable Membership](https://www.crossref.org/gem/) (GEM) Program.

The GEM Program supports publishers and organisations in low- and middle-income countries to participate in the global scholarly community by reducing barriers to membership and services.

Earlier this year, at our [Crossref Accra event](https://www.crossref.org/blog/reflections-from-crossref-accra-2025-strengthening-open-science-and-partnerships-in-ghana/), representatives from Noyam spoke about how registering metadata with Crossref has expanded their readership worldwide. They also encouraged other publishers and institutions in Africa to utilise Crossref’s infrastructure to enhance the visibility and impact of their work.

Following their award, we spoke with Naa Kai Amanor-Mfoafo from Noyam Journals about their approach to metadata quality. She shares her reflections in the Q&#38;A below.

## What motivates your team to work towards high-quality metadata?

Our commitment towards high-quality metadata stems from our organisational goal to promote the dissemination of usable knowledge by publishing innovative and high-quality research content. Over the last five years, registering our metadata with Crossref has strengtheed authors’ trust as their institutions can verify quality through tools like Crossmark. For instance, many institutions use the Crossmark feature on our published articles to access the latest information about a scholarly article, including updates, corrections, or retractions.

## Do you have a strategy for complete metadata?

We prioritise inclusion of ORCID IDs, Abstracts, and References as these increase visibility of our articles. We also include Affiliations, Licenses, and Crossmark, and we use Similarity Check to help ensure research integrity.

As part of our team structure, we have a dedicated staff member responsible for ensuring that every article is assigned a Crossref DOI on the same day it is published online. Our in-house system supports this process, allowing us to capture and register all the key metadata efficiently.

## What impact of good metadata can you see on your organisation?

Good metadata has made a real difference for our organisation. It has helped increase the visibility and discoverability of our journal articles, making it easier for researchers and readers around the world to find and cite our work. We’ve noticed more engagement with our publications since improving our metadata, which encourages us to keep strengthening the quality of the information we register.

## Have you encountered any challenges in curating or improving your metadata, and how did you address those?

One major challenge we’ve faced is discovering errors in previously uploaded metadata, and we haven’t yet established a systematic process for correcting them. We’re currently working to improve our workflow to help ensure the correctness of our metadata to follow Crossref’s recommended best practices.

## Have your efforts around metadata led to real benefits for your community?

Our authors appreciate the fact that their ORCID profiles are automatically updated with their published articles once they are assigned DOIs from Crossref. They are, of course, also enjoying increased visibility of our published articles globally.

## Looking ahead, how are you planning to build on your metadata quality?

We need to stay informed about developments at Crossref. Once in a while, we visit the Crossref website or participate in a webinar to stay informed. For example, a few months ago, we got to know that a new record registration form had been initiated for metadata uploads through the documentation section on the Crossref website.

We advise others who are new to Crossref to focus on consistency. Ensure your organisational system includes staff dedicated to keeping your metadata up to date. Secondly, feel free to seek technical support from the Crossref team when the need arises.</source:markdown>
