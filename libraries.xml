      <title>Piecing together the Research Nexus: uncovering relationships with open funding metadata</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/piecing-together-the-research-nexus-uncovering-relationships-with-open-funding-metadata/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The Crossref <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Grant Linking System (GLS)</a> has been facilitating the registration, sharing and re-use of open funding metadata for six years now, and we have reached some important milestones recently! What started as an interest in identifying funders through the Open Funder Registry evolved to a more nuanced and comprehensive way to share and re-use open funding data systematically. That’s how, in collaboration with the funding community, the Crossref Grant Linking System was developed. Open funding metadata is fundamental for the transparency and integrity of the research endeavour, so we are happy to see them included in the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">Research Nexus</a>.</p>
        <p>As emphasised recently by <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69" target="_blank">Hans de Jonge from NWO</a>, funding metadata’s value is in the transparency of the relationships it enables. The system is powered by the collective action of the research community– including research funders – that registers open metadata with Crossref, making these relationships possible. With close to 180,000 grant records in our corpus we wanted to know how far they reach and what story they tell.</p>
        <p>In March 2022, we <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/ske16-xve54" target="_blank">developed an approach for linking grants to research outputs</a> and analysed how many such relationships could be established. Now we’re able to present <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/aexidu9f" target="_blank">the latest dataset</a> that contains relationships between grants and research outputs, both those deposited by Crossref members and discovered by an automated matching strategy. It includes data deposited up to the end of July 2025.</p>
        <p>This work is part of our ongoing <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/">Metadata Matching</a> project.</p>
        <h2 id="what-exactly-is-in-this-new-open-dataset-of-grantoutput-relationships">What exactly is in this new open dataset of grant&lt;&gt;output relationships?</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The dataset contains 250,163 total funding relationships between grants and research outputs. </li>
        <li>We welcomed a number of funders, such as the <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69" target="_blank">Dutch Research Council</a> and <a href="https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/persistent-unique-identifiers-doi/" target="_blank">Fonds de Recherche du Quebec</a>, which together registered almost 27,000 grants in the past year. </li>
        <li>It’s clear that the more grant metadata is registered the more funding relationships we can uncover. </li>
        <li>The percentage of relationships that are registered explicitly by Crossref members providing grants IDs in funding information has grown from less than 0.1% in 2023 to 1% (modest numbers but amazing growth!).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-methodology">The methodology </h3>
        <p>We created <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/aexidu9f" target="_blank">a dataset of relationships between grants and research outputs</a> by analysing their metadata in several ways. A relationship is included in the dataset if at least one of the following conditions is met:</p>
        <ul>

Open funding metadata plays a central role in building a transparent, accountable and high integrity research environment by making visible the connections between the funding, grantees, research outputs, and their impact. Funders’ openness mandates and Open Science commitments emphasize the importance of traceability in the research process, so ensuring that the support given-whether financial or otherwise-can be systematically recorded and shared is instrumental.

At the same time, initiatives such as the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information</a> underscores the benefits of open, reusable funding metadata for monitoring, evaluation and assessment of research and researchers.</p>

        <p>Crossref houses millions of records, from the ubiquitous research articles and preprints, to books, peer review records, technical reports, datasets – you name it. Our members not only register, but also regularly update their metadata as new or corrected information becomes available. Our matching workflows allow us to make visible the hidden relationships and complete and improve the metadata records by adding new and reciprocal assertions.</p>
        <p>This analysis shows the unique value of registering funding metadata with Crossref and adding an essential piece to the Research Nexus puzzle. <strong>The relationship metadata allows the funding that underpins the research process to be connected, and contextualise scattered data points, acting as an anchor that links publications, people, and other research outputs.</strong> This is made possible by the impressive number of records continuously being registered by more than 23,000 member organisations, and by the increasing availability of funding information in the system with more research funders joining in and registering their grant metadata with us.</p>
        <h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
        <p>As we welcome more and more funders to the GLS, we, collectively, continue to complete the Research Nexus, record by record, field by field. The more awards we have in our corpus the more relationships we’ll uncover, so we’ll keep making these analyses periodically to make sure we don’t miss them.</p>
        <p>But it is not all on us. We are working towards a vision where Crossref Grant IDs are business as usual – where funders register their awards, grantees are aware of them and share them with publishers, and those publishers share them back with us when registering their content – closing the loop organically. We continue working on making this easier. In the upcoming works schema update a specific Crossref Grant ID field will be added in the funding information, alongside Award ID (for an internal identifier).</p>
        <p>Crucially, as the momentum of adoption among funders increases, and thousands of Crossref Grant IDs are available in the system, we are working with all members to raise their attention to the importance and desirability of funding metadata, so inclusion of that information in metadata of all works increases and consequently, the percentage of relationships asserted by Crossref members can grow.</p>
        <p>This matching analysis is just one example of what we do to enrich metadata to highlight relationships among works, individuals, institutions, and actions. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/">we launched the Metadata Matching project</a>, which is a major effort to rebuild our matching workflows using modern software development and data science practices. As part of the project, we plan to expose additional matched relationships between grants and research outputs in our REST API, alongside those deposited by our members. We’ll keep you updated as we go along!</p>

      <source:markdown>The Crossref [Grant Linking System (GLS)](https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/) has been facilitating the registration, sharing and re-use of open funding metadata for six years now, and we have reached some important milestones recently! What started as an interest in identifying funders through the Open Funder Registry evolved to a more nuanced and comprehensive way to share and re-use open funding data systematically. That’s how, in collaboration with the funding community, the Crossref Grant Linking System was developed. Open funding metadata is fundamental for the transparency and integrity of the research endeavour, so we are happy to see them included in the [Research Nexus](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/).

As emphasised recently by [Hans de Jonge from NWO](https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69), funding metadata’s value is in the transparency of the relationships it enables. The system is powered by the collective action of the research community– including research funders – that registers open metadata with Crossref, making these relationships possible. With close to 180,000 grant records in our corpus we wanted to know how far they reach and what story they tell.

In March 2022, we [developed an approach for linking grants to research outputs](https://doi.org/10.64000/ske16-xve54) and analysed how many such relationships could be established. Now we’re able to present [the latest dataset](https://doi.org/10.13003/aexidu9f) that contains relationships between grants and research outputs, both those deposited by Crossref members and discovered by an automated matching strategy. It includes data deposited up to the end of July 2025.

This work is part of our ongoing [Metadata Matching](https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/) project.

## What exactly is in this new open dataset of grant&#60;&#62;output relationships?

- The dataset contains 250,163 total funding relationships between grants and research outputs.
- We welcomed a number of funders, such as the [Dutch Research Council](https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69) and [Fonds de Recherche du Quebec](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/persistent-unique-identifiers-doi/), which together registered almost 27,000 grants in the past year.
- It’s clear that the more grant metadata is registered the more funding relationships we can uncover.
- The percentage of relationships that are registered explicitly by Crossref members providing grants IDs in funding information has grown from less than 0.1% in 2023 to 1% (modest numbers but amazing growth!).

### The methodology

We created [a dataset of relationships between grants and research outputs](https://doi.org/10.13003/aexidu9f) by analysing their metadata in several ways. A relationship is included in the dataset if at least one of the following conditions is met:

- A relationship was explicitly deposited by a Crossref member through a _finances_ or _isFinancedBy_ [relationship](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/markup-guide-metadata-segments/relationships/): 488 (0.2%) relationships
- The research output contains the grant DOI within the award number in the funding metadata: 2,003 (0.8%) relationships
- The award numbers in the grant and the research output are similar, and the associated funding organisations are either the same, or one is the sub-organisation of the other: 247,672 (99%) relationships

The dataset includes data deposited until the end of July 2025 and contains 250,163 total relationships.

The code used to generate the dataset is available [in our GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/crossref/data-science/matching-tools/-/tree/main/grant_matching/offline_dataset?ref_type=heads).

### The results

As you can see in the graph below, the number of relationships grant-research output continues to grow as the number of grants records Crossref members register with us increases.

![Graph of the number of relationships grant-research output](https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/graph-grant-research-output.png)

**Figure 1:** Cumulative totals of grants, linked grants, research outputs, and grant–research output relationships from 2019 to 2025. Stepwise increases correspond to the addition of major funder datasets, including Wellcome (2020), OSTI (2021), JST (2022), the European Union (2022), the Austrian Science Fund (2023), and the Fonds de recherche du Québec (2025).

Looking at the numbers broken down by grant registrants we can see that the more grants registered the more relationships can be uncovered. The table below shows funders who have at least 1,000 total grants registered and for whom at least 10% of their registered grants are linked to research outputs, showing the number of relationships, grants, linked grants and linked research outputs (sorted by the percentage of linked grants), and compared with the data from the 2023 analysis (where available) to see how the uptake of open funding metadata is evolving.

We encourage funders to join as members once they have determined the means of effective implementation of the GLS within their processes. By further analysing metadata of matched outputs, funders have the opportunity to monitor compliance with their policies and learn more about the impact of their programs.

### Following through funders’ Open Science commitments

The relationships showcased above and in the recent analysis are powered by open funding metadata. Open funding metadata plays a central role in building a transparent, accountable and high integrity research environment by making visible the connections between the funding, grantees, research outputs, and their impact. Funders’ openness mandates and Open Science commitments emphasize the importance of traceability in the research process, so ensuring that the support given-whether financial or otherwise-can be systematically recorded and shared is instrumental. Openness is also part of the strategic plans of institutions such as the International Science Council, who has [explicitly called for greater transparency in funding](https://council.science/blog/fighting-disinformation-with-sunshine-promoting-funding-transparency-in-science/) as a way to strengthen trust in science and counter misinformation. At the same time, initiatives such as the [Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information](https://barcelona-declaration.org/) underscores the benefits of open, reusable funding metadata for monitoring, evaluation and assessment of research and researchers.

Crossref’s Grant Linking System offers funders’ a way to demonstrate a commitment to openness, modeling the standards they expect of the research community they support, while creating a more robust, trustworthy and collaborative research ecosystem.

### Economy of scale: unlocking relationships with Crossref

Crossref houses millions of records, from the ubiquitous research articles and preprints, to books, peer review records, technical reports, datasets – you name it. Our members not only register, but also regularly update their metadata as new or corrected information becomes available. Our matching workflows allow us to make visible the hidden relationships and complete and improve the metadata records by adding new and reciprocal assertions.

This analysis shows the unique value of registering funding metadata with Crossref and adding an essential piece to the Research Nexus puzzle. **The relationship metadata allows the funding that underpins the research process to be connected, and contextualise scattered data points, acting as an anchor that links publications, people, and other research outputs.** This is made possible by the impressive number of records continuously being registered by more than 23,000 member organisations, and by the increasing availability of funding information in the system with more research funders joining in and registering their grant metadata with us.

### Next steps

As we welcome more and more funders to the GLS, we, collectively, continue to complete the Research Nexus, record by record, field by field. The more awards we have in our corpus the more relationships we’ll uncover, so we’ll keep making these analyses periodically to make sure we don’t miss them.

But it is not all on us. We are working towards a vision where Crossref Grant IDs are business as usual – where funders register their awards, grantees are aware of them and share them with publishers, and those publishers share them back with us when registering their content – closing the loop organically. We continue working on making this easier. In the upcoming works schema update a specific Crossref Grant ID field will be added in the funding information, alongside Award ID (for an internal identifier).

Crucially, as the momentum of adoption among funders increases, and thousands of Crossref Grant IDs are available in the system, we are working with all members to raise their attention to the importance and desirability of funding metadata, so inclusion of that information in metadata of all works increases and consequently, the percentage of relationships asserted by Crossref members can grow.

This matching analysis is just one example of what we do to enrich metadata to highlight relationships among works, individuals, institutions, and actions. Earlier this year, [we launched the Metadata Matching project](https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/), which is a major effort to rebuild our matching workflows using modern software development and data science practices. As part of the project, we plan to expose additional matched relationships between grants and research outputs in our REST API, alongside those deposited by our members. We’ll keep you updated as we go along!

      <title>Innovation in scientific publishing and its implications for Crossref DOI registration practices - Request for input</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/innovation-in-scientific-publishing-and-its-implications-for-crossref-doi-registration-practices-request-for-input/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><em>Lots of exciting innovations are being made in scientific publishing, often raising fundamental questions about established publishing practices. In this guest post, Ludo Waltman and André Brasil discuss the recently launched MetaROR publish-review-curate platform and the questions it raises about good practices for Crossref DOI registration in this emerging landscape.</em></p>
        <p>Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique identifiers commonly assigned to research outputs such as journal articles, preprints, peer review reports, and datasets. The DOI of a research output allows the output to be identified online in a persistent way, even when the underlying publishing infrastructure changes (e.g., a journal moving from one publisher to another).</p>
        <p>There are several DOI registration agencies. Most of the larger scientific publishers work with Crossref, and so do many preprint servers, and therefore our focus in this post is on Crossref. Crossref also keeps track of <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5_v2" target="_blank">metadata associated with research outputs</a>, such as the title, authors, and publication date of an output, and it makes this metadata openly available via APIs for all kinds of services to ingest and reuse. Because indexing, discovery, and evaluation tools rely heavily on this metadata, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration/">content registration practices</a> and metadata design choices can have major effects on the visibility and findability of research outputs and on analytics used to monitor and assess research outputs and their contributors.</p>
        <p>For the most common types of research outputs, such as journal articles and preprints, a broad consensus has emerged over the past decades on good practices for DOI registration. Such consensus means that articles are assigned the record type ‘article’ in their Crossref metadata. Likewise, many preprint servers register DOIs for preprints at Crossref, with the record type ‘preprint’ in the metadata. (The arXiv preprint server is an exception; it registers DOIs for preprints with DataCite rather than Crossref.)</p>
        <p>For innovative new publication platforms, however, good practices for DOI registration are less clear. The approaches to scientific publishing offered by these platforms often do not fit neatly into established ways of working. For instance, for some of these platforms, the traditional distinction between peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals and non-peer-reviewed articles posted on preprint servers is no longer applicable. This raises fundamental questions about suitable DOI registration practices for new approaches to scientific publishing.</p>
        <h2 id="metaror">MetaROR</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://metaror.org/" target="_blank">MetaROR (MetaResearch Open Review) platform</a>, launched in November 2024 by the Research on Research Institute (RoRI) and the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science (AIMOS), offers an example of the challenge of developing appropriate DOI registration practices for new publishing models.</p>
        <p>Inspired by similar initiatives such as <a href="https://elifesciences.org/" target="_blank">eLife</a> and others, MetaROR adopts the so-called <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/h7swt" target="_blank">publish-review-curate model</a>. Authors first publish their article on a preprint server and then submit it to MetaROR. MetaROR then organizes an open peer review process for the article. Review reports are published on the MetaROR platform, along with a copy of the preprinted article and an editorial assessment. Rather than a simple binary decision (accept vs. reject), an editorial assessment is a short one-paragraph statement summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of an article. Each review report and each editorial assessment has its own DOI registered at Crossref. In this way, review reports are treated as first-class research outputs that can, for instance, be indexed in scientific literature databases and can be cited in other research outputs.</p>
        <p>For an article submitted to MetaROR, the publication of the review reports, the editorial assessment, and a copy of the article itself concludes MetaROR’s publish-review-curate process. The authors of the article may revise their work in light of the feedback received, and MetaROR may review the revised article. However, there is no requirement that revisions must be made. The primary aim of the review reports and the editorial assessment published on the MetaROR platform is to offer context for readers of the article, helping readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the article.</p>

      <source:markdown>_Lots of exciting innovations are being made in scientific publishing, often raising fundamental questions about established publishing practices. In this guest post, Ludo Waltman and André Brasil discuss the recently launched MetaROR publish-review-curate platform and the questions it raises about good practices for Crossref DOI registration in this emerging landscape._

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique identifiers commonly assigned to research outputs such as journal articles, preprints, peer review reports, and datasets. The DOI of a research output allows the output to be identified online in a persistent way, even when the underlying publishing infrastructure changes (e.g., a journal moving from one publisher to another).

There are several DOI registration agencies. Most of the larger scientific publishers work with Crossref, and so do many preprint servers, and therefore our focus in this post is on Crossref. Crossref also keeps track of [metadata associated with research outputs](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5_v2), such as the title, authors, and publication date of an output, and it makes this metadata openly available via APIs for all kinds of services to ingest and reuse. Because indexing, discovery, and evaluation tools rely heavily on this metadata, [content registration practices](https://www.crossref.org/services/content-registration/) and metadata design choices can have major effects on the visibility and findability of research outputs and on analytics used to monitor and assess research outputs and their contributors.

For the most common types of research outputs, such as journal articles and preprints, a broad consensus has emerged over the past decades on good practices for DOI registration. Such consensus means that articles are assigned the record type ‘article’ in their Crossref metadata. Likewise, many preprint servers register DOIs for preprints at Crossref, with the record type ‘preprint’ in the metadata. (The arXiv preprint server is an exception; it registers DOIs for preprints with DataCite rather than Crossref.)

For innovative new publication platforms, however, good practices for DOI registration are less clear. The approaches to scientific publishing offered by these platforms often do not fit neatly into established ways of working. For instance, for some of these platforms, the traditional distinction between peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals and non-peer-reviewed articles posted on preprint servers is no longer applicable. This raises fundamental questions about suitable DOI registration practices for new approaches to scientific publishing.

## MetaROR

The [MetaROR (MetaResearch Open Review) platform](https://metaror.org/), launched in November 2024 by the Research on Research Institute (RoRI) and the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science (AIMOS), offers an example of the challenge of developing appropriate DOI registration practices for new publishing models.

Inspired by similar initiatives such as [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/) and others, MetaROR adopts the so-called [publish-review-curate model](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/h7swt). Authors first publish their article on a preprint server and then submit it to MetaROR. MetaROR then organizes an open peer review process for the article. Review reports are published on the MetaROR platform, along with a copy of the preprinted article and an editorial assessment. Rather than a simple binary decision (accept vs. reject), an editorial assessment is a short one-paragraph statement summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of an article. Each review report and each editorial assessment has its own DOI registered at Crossref. In this way, review reports are treated as first-class research outputs that can, for instance, be indexed in scientific literature databases and can be cited in other research outputs.

For an article submitted to MetaROR, the publication of the review reports, the editorial assessment, and a copy of the article itself concludes MetaROR’s publish-review-curate process. The authors of the article may revise their work in light of the feedback received, and MetaROR may review the revised article. However, there is no requirement that revisions must be made. The primary aim of the review reports and the editorial assessment published on the MetaROR platform is to offer context for readers of the article, helping readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the article.

## Crossref DOI registration

[Registration of DOIs](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/peer-reviews/) for open peer review reports is [increasingly common](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-growth-of-open-peer-review). By registering Crossref DOIs for review reports and editorial assessments, MetaROR enables reviewers and editors to be recognized for their contributions. But what about recognition for authors?

A crucial element in MetaROR’s philosophy is that authors of articles peer-reviewed by MetaROR deserve to be recognized in a similar way as authors of articles published in traditional peer-reviewed journals. One way to promote appropriate recognition for authors of articles peer-reviewed by MetaROR is to ensure that articles on the MetaROR platform, just like articles in peer-reviewed journals, [have their own DOI](https://www.openscience.nl/en/cases/the-metaror-publish-review-curate-model-our-experience-as-authors). While this may seem straightforward to arrange, it actually raises two non-trivial questions about good practices for Crossref DOI registration:

1. For each article on the MetaROR platform, there is a corresponding article on a preprint server. Is it acceptable to have two Crossref DOIs, one registered by the preprint server and one registered by the MetaROR platform, for essentially the same article?
2. If Crossref DOIs are registered for articles on the MetaROR platform, should the articles be assigned the type ‘article’ or the type ‘preprint’ in their Crossref metadata, or something else entirely?

On the first question, it could be argued that having [two Crossref DOIs for the same article](https://doi.org/10.64000/xjgnq-a3p05) is problematic and that MetaROR, therefore, should not register DOIs for articles on its platform. Alternatively, one could argue that an article on the MetaROR platform differs in a meaningful way from the corresponding article on a preprint server, since the article on the MetaROR platform has been enriched with peer review reports and an editorial assessment, similar to the way an article in a peer-reviewed journal may be seen as an enriched version of the corresponding article on a preprint server. This line of reasoning would justify registering DOIs for articles on the MetaROR platform.

On the second question, the argument could be made that articles on the MetaROR platform should be assigned the type ‘preprint’ in their Crossref metadata, since the type ‘article’ is intended for articles in journals and MetaROR does not consider itself to be a journal (in fact, MetaROR works with [partner journals](https://cms.metaror.org/partner-journals/) to enable articles peer-reviewed by MetaROR to be published in journals) and does not certify articles in the way journals do (i.e., MetaROR does not make accept/reject decisions). On the other hand, one could argue that articles on the MetaROR platform should be assigned the type ‘article’, since the peer-reviewed nature of articles in journals is typically seen as the key factor distinguishing these articles from articles on preprint servers. Articles on the MetaROR platform have been peer-reviewed, and in that sense, they resemble articles in journals. A third line of reasoning could be that neither the ‘preprint’ nor the ‘article’ type is fully appropriate for articles on the MetaROR platform and, consequently, that there is a need for a new Crossref record type.

      <title>Crossref and PKP enter new partnership phase to support richer and more inclusive metadata</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-and-pkp-enter-new-partnership-phase-to-support-richer-and-more-inclusive-metadata/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Crossref and the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) have been working closely together for many years, sharing resources and supporting our overlapping communities of organisations involved in communicating research. Now we’re delighted to share that we have agreed on a new set of objectives for our partnership, centred on further development of the tools that our shared community relies upon, as well as building capacity to enable richer metadata registration for organisations using the Open Journal Systems (OJS).</p>
        <p>Crossref is working towards the vision of a rich and open network underpinning global scholarship, making relationships between works, people, institutions, and actions visible, thanks to the thread of metadata – the research nexus. This vision depends upon participation of research communication organisations coming from all parts of the world, disciplines, and languages. Working with PKP towards making tools for metadata registration more comprehensive, accessible, and easier to use is a big step towards supporting our community to participate in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">the research nexus</a>.</p>
        <p>The renewed partnership has three main goals:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Developments to improve experience and support metadata registration workflows in OJS, bringing relevant functionalities together under the Crossref plug-in, and developing an OMP Crossref plug-in.</li>
        <li>Joint community engagement in support of transitioning OJS users to the future Long-Term Support (LTS) version of OJS, which will enable richer metadata registration.</li>

      <source:markdown>Crossref and the Public Knowledge Project (PKP) have been working closely together for many years, sharing resources and supporting our overlapping communities of organisations involved in communicating research. Now we’re delighted to share that we have agreed on a new set of objectives for our partnership, centred on further development of the tools that our shared community relies upon, as well as building capacity to enable richer metadata registration for organisations using the Open Journal Systems (OJS).

Crossref is working towards the vision of a rich and open network underpinning global scholarship, making relationships between works, people, institutions, and actions visible, thanks to the thread of metadata – the research nexus. This vision depends upon participation of research communication organisations coming from all parts of the world, disciplines, and languages. Working with PKP towards making tools for metadata registration more comprehensive, accessible, and easier to use is a big step towards supporting our community to participate in [the research nexus](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/).

The renewed partnership has three main goals:

- Developments to improve experience and support metadata registration workflows in OJS, bringing relevant functionalities together under the Crossref plug-in, and developing an OMP Crossref plug-in.
- Joint community engagement in support of transitioning OJS users to the future Long-Term Support (LTS) version of OJS, which will enable richer metadata registration.
- Creation of a PKP School self-paced training course for system administrators.

[Crossref and PKP have a rich history of collaboration](https://doi.org/10.59350/n3pa8-x3548), including previous investment in tools development in 2020, which resulted in some vital improvements to Crossref metadata management in OJS and a more streamlined experience for Crossref members on the platform, as well as many collaborative community events and training.

We know that thousands of Crossref members use OJS to register their metadata. Many are based in resource-constrained institutions, so the training provided by Crossref and PKP will be key to building their capacity to participate in the research nexus. With OJS 3.5 empowering organisations to register richer metadata, we look forward to opening up more opportunities for members to enhance their participation.

&#62; At PKP, we’re excited to deepen our longstanding collaboration with Crossref, supporting our global community in amplifying the visibility and impact of their research through streamlined integration for robust metadata management. By working together on both technological innovation and capacity-building initiatives, we anticipate even greater outcomes that will strengthen open scholarship throughout the duration of this partnership and well into the future.” – said Kevin Stranack, PKP Director of Operations.

      <title>Raising the standard: GigaScience Press on metadata and discoverability</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/raising-the-standard-gigascience-press-on-metadata-and-discoverability/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>To mark Crossref’s 25th anniversary, we launched our first Metadata Awards to highlight members with the best metadata practices.
        <a href="https://www.gigasciencepress.org/" target="_blank">GigaScience Press</a>, based in Hong Kong, was the leader among small publishers, defined as organisations with less than USD 1 million in publishing revenue or expenses. We spoke with Scott Edmunds, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief at GigaScience Press, about how discoverability drives their high metadata standards.</p>
        <h3 id="what-motivates-your-organisationteam-to-work-towards-high-quality-metadata-what-objectives-does-it-support-for-your-organisation">What motivates your organisation/team to work towards high-quality metadata? What objectives does it support for your organisation?</h3>
        <p>Our objective is to communicate science openly and collaboratively, without barriers, to solve problems in a data- and evidence-driven manner through Open Science publishing. High-quality metadata helps us address these objectives by improving the discoverability, transparency, and provenance of the work we publish. It is an integral part of the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR principles</a> and UNESCO Open Science Recommendation, playing a role in increasing the accessibility of research for both humans and machines. As one of the authors of the FAIR principles paper and an advisor of the <a href="https://makedatacount.org/" target="_blank">Make Data Count</a> project, I’ve also personally been very conscious to practice what I preach.</p>
        <h3 id="do-you-have-a-strategy-for-complete-metadata-which-elements-did-you-prioritise-what-workflows-tools-or-collaborations-helped-you-get-there">Do you have a strategy for complete metadata? Which elements did you prioritise? What workflows, tools, or collaborations helped you get there?</h3>
        <p>We’ve been privileged to work with our technical partners at <a href="https://rivervalley.io/" target="_blank">River Valley Technologies</a>, and the novel XML-first publishing platform they have developed has made it particularly easy to integrate and collect persistent identifiers and other metadata, embedding it into the resulting rich-XML. As Open Access advocates, licensing and machine readability were early focuses when launching our journals. We ensured that we provided a text and data mining portal, allowing bulk downloads of our content to encourage reuse. Many specific metadata elements highlighted by the FAIR principles and <a href="https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546#:~:text=The%20UNESCO%20Recommendation%20on%20Open,openly%20available%2C%20accessible%20and%20reusable" target="_blank">UNESCO Open Science</a> recommendations, and so these have also helped guide what should be prioritised. If there’s one specific tool to mention, we’ve been big fans of the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reports/participation-reports/" target="_blank">Crossref participation reports</a>, as this has helped highlight what is missing and what we need to improve upon.</p>
        <h3 id="how-have-you-integrated-these-into-your-metadata-processes">How have you integrated these into your metadata processes?</h3>
        <p>The participation reports, in particular, have been useful for this, and by regularly checking them, we’ve managed to spot when processes have broken, for example. When you’ve added new fields to the reports like <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR IDs (Research Organization Registry)</a>, this has also motivated us to prioritise integrating these, so having a curated list of metadata fields like this definitively helps users focus on what should be the most important. River Valley Technologies has been very responsive to this type of feedback, and being able to see the participation report data in real-time has helped drive them to fix and update our metadata. So I thank them for being so patient and quick to respond to our very demanding standards.</p>
        <h3 id="what-impact-of-good-metadata-can-you-see-for-your-organisation">What impact of good metadata can you see for your organisation?</h3>
        <p>From an Editorial side, our technical partners at River Valley Technologies have found having this metadata information available very useful in the Research Integrity tools they have developed and integrated into our publication platform. Things like <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID IDs</a>, RORs, and other identifiers are very useful for tracking provenance and increasing trust.</p>
        <p>From a business side, putting the effort into collecting rich metadata has paid off in the long run by making it easier to integrate our publishing data into new platforms. Making it easier and quicker to integrate and track our data via <a href="https://oaswitchboard.org/" target="_blank">OA Switchboard</a>, for example. It also helps us more easily mirror and list our content in indexes like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/" target="_blank">PMC</a>, <a href="https://www.scopus.com/" target="_blank">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/" target="_blank">Web of Science</a>, and others.</p>
        <h3 id="have-you-encountered-any-challenges-in-curating-or-improving-your-metadata">Have you encountered any challenges in curating or improving your metadata?</h3>
        <p>One of the main metadata areas that has currently let us down, funding and registries, is because our publishing model is so affordable. The automated production processes from RVT&rsquo;s novel publishing platform have allowed us to publish very cost-effectively (the APC of GigaByte is $535). We’ve also received sponsorship from the WHO to publish a series of public health papers, particularly supporting authors from the Global South who may not have sources of funding listed in these registries. Because of this, we’ve published numerous papers from independent researchers, students, and self-financed projects that may not have funding IDs or grant numbers. We’d like to push to get “unfunded” counted as a metadata field to address this.</p>
        <h3 id="have-your-efforts-regarding-metadata-yielded-tangible-benefits-for-your-community-is-this-something-your-editors-authors-or-readers-are-aware-of-and-appreciate-if-so-why">Have your efforts regarding metadata yielded tangible benefits for your community? Is this something your editors, authors, or readers are aware of and appreciate? If so, why?</h3>
        <p>We’d like to think our authors find this useful, but we’ve not had any specific feedback on this. Our readers, both human and machine, should hopefully appreciate finding our work more easily, and from a purely selfish perspective, should get us higher access and citations. This is difficult to measure, but as evidence nerds, we have <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/xv7tk" target="_blank">attempted to conduct RCTs</a> examining this for Data Citations. One anecdote I can give is about the author who told us they pasted their paper into ChatGPT and asked it which was the best journal for their work, and it suggested our journal. I’d like to think that putting in this effort in making our papers more machine-readable and comprehensible pays off at times like this to make the discoverability and visibility of our journals greater.</p>
        <h3 id="looking-ahead-how-are-you-planning-to-build-on-your-metadata-quality-are-there-new-elements-or-practices-youre-exploring-and-what-advice-would-you-give-to-others-just-starting-to-strengthen-their-metadata">Looking ahead, how are you planning to build on your metadata quality? Are there new elements or practices you’re exploring? And what advice would you give to others just starting to strengthen their metadata?</h3>
        <p>We still need to update older content with RORs, and improve it for the datasets
        linked to our papers. To do this, we’ve had interns working to improve our <a href="https://datacite.org/" target="_blank">DataCite</a> metadata.</p>
        <p>We encourage others to think about metadata issues when setting up their workflows. While it may seem like additional work, it will be increasingly important to future-proof and get journals ready for our increasingly AI-centric age. And as we show here, we can more easily carry out important tasks like getting your content more quickly and widely indexed and disseminated.</p>
        <p>Strong metadata ties open science, integrity, and discoverability together. GigaScience Press shows how consistent identifiers, machine-readable formats, and continuous checks deliver real benefits. As discovery becomes more AI-assisted, the priority is clear: keep metadata complete, open, and usable.</p>

      <source:markdown>To mark Crossref’s 25th anniversary, we launched our first Metadata Awards to highlight members with the best metadata practices.
[GigaScience Press](https://www.gigasciencepress.org/), based in Hong Kong, was the leader among small publishers, defined as organisations with less than USD 1 million in publishing revenue or expenses. We spoke with Scott Edmunds, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief at GigaScience Press, about how discoverability drives their high metadata standards.

### What motivates your organisation/team to work towards high-quality metadata? What objectives does it support for your organisation?

Our objective is to communicate science openly and collaboratively, without barriers, to solve problems in a data- and evidence-driven manner through Open Science publishing. High-quality metadata helps us address these objectives by improving the discoverability, transparency, and provenance of the work we publish. It is an integral part of the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and UNESCO Open Science Recommendation, playing a role in increasing the accessibility of research for both humans and machines. As one of the authors of the FAIR principles paper and an advisor of the [Make Data Count](https://makedatacount.org/) project, I’ve also personally been very conscious to practice what I preach.

### Do you have a strategy for complete metadata? Which elements did you prioritise? What workflows, tools, or collaborations helped you get there?

We’ve been privileged to work with our technical partners at [River Valley Technologies](https://rivervalley.io/), and the novel XML-first publishing platform they have developed has made it particularly easy to integrate and collect persistent identifiers and other metadata, embedding it into the resulting rich-XML. As Open Access advocates, licensing and machine readability were early focuses when launching our journals.

If there’s one specific tool to mention, we’ve been big fans of the [Crossref participation reports](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reports/participation-reports/), as this has helped highlight what is missing and what we need to improve upon.

### How have you integrated these into your metadata processes?

The participation reports, in particular, have been useful for this, and by regularly checking them, we’ve managed to spot when processes have broken, for example. When you’ve added new fields to the reports like [ROR IDs (Research Organization Registry)](https://ror.org/), this has also motivated us to prioritise integrating these, so having a curated list of metadata fields like this definitively helps users focus on what should be the most important. River Valley Technologies has been very responsive to this type of feedback, and being able to see the participation report data in real-time has helped drive them to fix and update our metadata. So I thank them for being so patient and quick to respond to our very demanding standards.

### What impact of good metadata can you see for your organisation?

From an Editorial side, our technical partners at River Valley Technologies have found having this metadata information available very useful in the Research Integrity tools they have developed and integrated into our publication platform. Things like [ORCID IDs](https://orcid.org/), RORs, and other identifiers are very useful for tracking provenance and increasing trust.

It also helps us more easily mirror and list our content in indexes like [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/), [Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/), and others.

### Have you encountered any challenges in curating or improving your metadata?

One of the main metadata areas that has currently let us down, funding and registries, is because our publishing model is so affordable. The automated production processes from RVT’s novel publishing platform have allowed us to publish very cost-effectively (the APC of GigaByte is $535). We’ve also received sponsorship from the WHO to publish a series of public health papers, particularly supporting authors from the Global South who may not have sources of funding listed in these registries. Because of this, we’ve published numerous papers from independent researchers, students, and self-financed projects that may not have funding IDs or grant numbers. We’d like to push to get “unfunded” counted as a metadata field to address this.

### Have your efforts regarding metadata yielded tangible benefits for your community? Is this something your editors, authors, or readers are aware of and appreciate? If so, why?

We’d like to think our authors find this useful, but we’ve not had any specific feedback on this. Our readers, both human and machine, should hopefully appreciate finding our work more easily, and from a purely selfish perspective, should get us higher access and citations. This is difficult to measure, but as evidence nerds, we have [attempted to conduct RCTs](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/xv7tk) examining this for Data Citations. One anecdote I can give is about the author who told us they pasted their paper into ChatGPT and asked it which was the best journal for their work, and it suggested our journal. I’d like to think that putting in this effort in making our papers more machine-readable and comprehensible pays off at times like this to make the discoverability and visibility of our journals greater.

### Looking ahead, how are you planning to build on your metadata quality? Are there new elements or practices you’re exploring? And what advice would you give to others just starting to strengthen their metadata?

We still need to update older content with RORs, and improve it for the datasets
linked to our papers. To do this, we’ve had interns working to improve our [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) metadata.

We encourage others to think about metadata issues when setting up their workflows. While it may seem like additional work, it will be increasingly important to future-proof and get journals ready for our increasingly AI-centric age. And as we show here, we can more easily carry out important tasks like getting your content more quickly and widely indexed and disseminated.

Strong metadata ties open science, integrity, and discoverability together. GigaScience Press shows how consistent identifiers, machine-readable formats, and continuous checks deliver real benefits. As discovery becomes more AI-assisted, the priority is clear: keep metadata complete, open, and usable.

&#62; While it may seem like additional work, it will be increasingly important to future-proof and get journals ready for our increasingly AI-centric age.
