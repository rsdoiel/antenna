State policymakers and institutions face increasing pressure to demonstrate “value” to taxpayers and prospective students, which often means redirecting state funding to “credentials of value” as measured by students’ earnings. Yet those who have experienced a liberal arts and sciences education often describe deeply appreciating its value, even if they have difficulty quantifying that value or describing exactly which features of their education made it so meaningful.

      <title>Highlights of a very busy year: our 2025 annual report</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/highlights-of-a-very-busy-year-our-2025-annual-report/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>As we finish <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/25years/">celebrating our 25th anniversary</a>, we can look back on a truly transformational year, defined by the successful delivery of several long-planned, foundational projects&mdash;as well as updates to our teams, services, and fees&mdash;that position Crossref for success over the next quarter century as essential open scholarly infrastructure. In our <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/bm6g0-gvy36" target="_blank">update at the end of 2024</a>, we highlighted that we had restructured our leadership team and paused some projects. The changes made in 2024 positioned us for a year of getting things done in 2025. We launched cross-functional programs, modernised our systems, strengthened connections with our growing global community, and streamlined a bunch of technical and business operations while continuing to grow our staff, members, content, relationships, and community connections.</p>
        <p>Read on for the highlights of a very busy year, grouped around our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy/">four strategic themes</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="strategic-theme-1-contribute-to-an-environment-where-the-community-identifies-and-co-creates-solutions-for-broad-benefit">Strategic theme 1: Contribute to an environment where the community identifies and co-creates solutions for broad benefit</h2>
        <h3 id="enhanced-tools-and-services">Enhanced tools and services</h3>
        <p>In October, we released an <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/8d5ga-2n897" target="_blank">enhanced Participation Reports dashboard</a> that shows metadata coverage across all 180 million records and provides individual member organisations with actionable gap reports to guide them to improve metadata completeness. The new tool provides more complete coverage of all members and resource types, now including funders and grants, with up to 11 best-practice metadata elements publicly tracked.</p>
        <p>We launched support for journal articles in the <a href="https://manage.crossref.org/" target="_blank">New Metadata Manager record registration form</a> (initially only for grants), which includes built-in reference and relationships deposit capabilities. In the New Metadata Manager, it’s now also possible to search for previously registered DOIs to edit your metadata records. In the coming years, we are planning to expand the new Metadata Manager to support all the many different content types that you can register with Crossref DOIs.</p>
        <p>After a long break between regular updates, we have fixed our process for and <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/open_funder_registry" target="_blank">just released v.1.63 of the Open Funder registry</a>. With the updated process, we&rsquo;re now able to resume more frequent updates to the registry (while of course still working towards the transition to ROR for funders).</p>
        <p>Throughout 2025, we conducted a website information architecture review to improve the information we provide to our members and the wider community. Based on the recommendations from this review, we will be renewing our website and documentation in 2026.</p>
        <h3 id="deprecations-and-modernisation">Deprecations and modernisation</h3>
        <p>‘Old’ Metadata Manager is to be <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/ys7s6-pwn71" target="_blank">retired at the end of 2025</a>, with users transitioning to the &lsquo;New&rsquo; version or to our other helper tools for registering and updating DOIs. All users have been contacted during 2025 and received <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN3M90LKNqs" target="_blank">training on how to use the New Metadata Manager</a>.</p>
        <p>We also <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/w6pw6-c7y02" target="_blank">announced the deprecation of Co-access</a>, which will end in 2026, bringing an end to the service that allowed duplicate DOIs for book content. Users of co-access have been informed and are in the process of transitioning to <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/creating-and-managing-dois/multiple-resolution/">multiple resolution</a>.</p>
        <p>Together with Turnitin and our members, we are working to transition all subscribers to our Similarity Check service to a new version of iThenticate 2.0. We are happy to report that all platforms with integrations with us transitioned to 2.0 during 2025, and we will continue working with our members to get everyone transitioned during 2026.</p>
        <h3 id="eating-our-own-doi-dogfood">Eating our own DOI dogfood</h3>
        <p>In June this year, we were particularly pleased to finally <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/552ec-b8g03" target="_blank">support the registration of DOIs for our own content, this very blog</a>, through partnering with Rogue Scholar. Blogs are a growing format for scholarly discourse and our own blog is no different as it’s the main way that we share guidelines and best practices, as well as news and stories from the scholarly community. With a Crossref DOI for all blogs going back to 2006, we’re setting ourselves up to ensure better future preservation of the discussion and information about Crossref.</p>
        <h3 id="community-connections">Community connections</h3>
        <p>We delivered 29 metadata health-check webinars over the course of the year, in French, Indonesian, Spanish, and English, reaching 2,166 participants with practical advice on identifying gaps in journal metadata using <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">Participation Reports</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/x38ew-0n632" target="_blank">Crossref Accra</a> took place in March as our first in-person event in a <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">GEM</a> country. We also held similar events in Ecuador and Türkiye with <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/17251274" target="_blank">Crossref Quito</a> in September and <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/17952555" target="_blank">Crossref Ankara</a> in November. At these three events, we welcomed key figures from each country&rsquo;s library, government, publishing, and academic communities and we learned so much about the thriving communities there, and also that even more dedicated workshops on the specifics of metadata quality improvements would be appreciated.</p>
        <p>Our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/metadata-sprint/">metadata sprint in Madrid</a> in April brought together community members to tackle specific problems collaboratively, with teams exploring coding, documentation, translation, and research using our open metadata. We&rsquo;re already planning our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/metadata-sprint/">next sprint in São Paulo</a> for March 2026, and it will be held in three languages: Portuguese, Spanish, and English.</p>
        <p>A strategic goal for Crossref is to grow research funders’ adoption of the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Grant Linking System</a>, and we produced the first in a series of interviews with funder members this year to highlight how and why Crossref DOIs are fulfilling goals to assess the reach and return of their research support for <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/n9n69-y5b75" target="_blank">FWF</a> (Austria), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69" target="_blank">NWO</a> (Netherlands), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/9gjfp-5p698" target="_blank">FCCN|FCT</a> (Portugal), and <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/c1dh8-qn968" target="_blank">Wellcome</a>. This year, we welcomed more funders including Fonds de recherche du Québec (Canada) and Independent Research Fund Denmark as part of their national research platform NORA; we look forward to reporting on their experiences and outcomes next year and others as they work towards Crossref Grant DOI adoption.</p>
        <p>We continued working closely with PKP and <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/r2zgm-99706" target="_blank">renewed our partnership to help drive better experience for OJS users</a> registering metadata with Crossref. We also delivered a proportion of the metadata health-checks together to maximise the learning opportunities for our members using OJS; and we joined PKP Sprint in Oslo to help make improvements to OJS and OMP.</p>
        <p>Crossref staff members serve on almost 50 committees, boards, and other community bodies alongside our own direct work. These include in the areas of research integrity, metascience, metadata and PID standards, open science policy or monitoring, development of new models (such as Diamond OA), editorial production, library and institutional publishing, and citation and other metadata analyses. We also work with other DOI Registration Agencies and support the sustainability of the DOI Foundation with an additional annual subsidy. Many DOI RAs are also Crossref Sponsors so that their members can access our unique reference matching service. While we often might advise, we also learn a huge amount from collaborating with the numerous systems and initiatives that make up thw wider research community.</p>
        <p>Our involvement with developing the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information</a> led us to become the fiscal host and to participate in most of the working groups on open metadata. Of particular note this year was the Funding Metadata Working Group round table about <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/news/20251023_community_roundtable/" target="_blank">moving forward the state of funding metadata</a>, which we co-hosted with Barcelona Declaration colleagues, and three funding bodies, NWO (Netherlands), FWF (Austria), and ANR (France) as we heard from publishers and their vendors about challenges and how to overcome them to increase the quantity and quality of available open funding metadata.</p>
        <p>All our community engagement activities have been enthusiastically supported and enriched by our indispensable <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/our-ambassadors/">Ambassadors</a> and our group of now 130 <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/">Sponsors</a>, organisations that help thousands of Crossref members with local language and technical support and lower cost access to our membership.</p>
        <h2 id="strategic-theme-2-a-sustainable-source-of-complete-open-and-global-scholarly-metadata-and-relationships">Strategic theme 2: A sustainable source of complete, open, and global scholarly metadata and relationships</h2>
        <h3 id="schema-developments">Schema developments</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/grants-schema/">grant schema version 0.2.0 was released in January</a>, adding support for ROR identifiers to identify funders and new funding types for in our taxonomy, including APC, BPC, and infrastructure. All of these funding types can be specified in the metadata of our grant-giving members alongside the existing types such as use of facilities or salary/training awards, etc.</p>
        <p>Version <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/325070" target="_blank">5.4 of our publications schema was released in March</a>, marking our first update in many years and a great opportunity to learn how to do this and make the process more efficient. This release introduced typed references to denote the type of object referenced (dataset, blog, software, etc.), preprint status indicators, and version numbering.</p>
        <p>Just last week, we also added a dedicated field for <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/markup-guide-metadata-segments/funding-information">grant DOIs to our publications schema</a>. This means it’s now possible to indicate in an article&rsquo;s metadata which grant(s) funded the research using the persistent identifier. This is an essential step toward better alignment between grant funding and research, enriching the Research Nexus.</p>
        <p>We also launched our new <a href="https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/metadata-advisory/">Metadata Advisory Group</a> and they have already devised sub-working groups in the three focus topic areas:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Multilingual metadata</li>
        <li>Subjects and keywords</li>
        <li>Relationships</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="public-data-file">Public data file</h3>
        <p>We released the <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/614659" target="_blank">2025 public data file</a> in March, containing metadata for (at the time) over 165 million research outputs from more than 22,000 organisations.</p>
        <h3 id="inaugural-metadata-awards">Inaugural Metadata Awards</h3>
        <p>In May, we launched the <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/xh94q-w7335" target="_blank">first-ever Metadata Awards</a> to recognise members demonstrating excellence in metadata completeness and enrichment. Winners included <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/v2v2s-r9037" target="_blank">Noyam Publishers</a> (Ghana), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/z2qhj-7nd90" target="_blank">GigaScience Press</a> (Hong Kong), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/3gcdf-23s29" target="_blank">eLife</a> (UK), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/xxwy3-xhf38" target="_blank">American Society for Microbiology</a> (USA), <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/51bv6-89j85" target="_blank">Universidad La Salle Arequipa</a> (Peru), and <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/hkxmk-5qe50" target="_blank">Instituto Geologico y Minero de España</a> (Spain). The awards will be held biennially going forward.</p>
        <h3 id="metadata-matching-project">Metadata Matching project</h3>
        <p>In April, we launched the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/">metadata matching</a> project with the aim of building a more complete picture of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">the research nexus</a> over time by automatically identifying missing relationships between entities across the scholarly record. The project’s goal is to modernise Crossref’s enrichment workflows by rebuilding them using modern software development and data science practices.</p>
        <p>We are in the throws of developing a consolidated matching workflow that will eventually replace all existing production matching processes, with results exposed through the REST API. All new matching strategies will be rigorously evaluated, and the resulting data will be accompanied by clear provenance information. This project covers six matching tasks:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>bibliographic reference matching</li>
        <li>funder name matching</li>
        <li>preprint matching</li>
        <li>affiliation matching</li>
        <li>grant matching</li>
        <li>title matching</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the meantime, while work continues on integrating matching results into the REST API, we’ve been releasing standalone matching datasets for separate download and analysis. These include <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15124417" target="_blank">relationships between preprints and journal articles</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15254993" target="_blank">relationships involving research organisations</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/waej1een" target="_blank">relationships between grants and research outputs</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="data-infrastructure-and-research-nexus-participation-dashboard">Data infrastructure and Research Nexus participation dashboard</h3>
        <p>Staying on the data science front, we’ve established an internal data environment that combines all relevant data sources (scholarly metadata, logs and usage data, and external datasets) in their raw forms into a single place. This environment is supported by a suite of modern tools and data processing techniques, enabling data science experiments and analytics pipelines to run effectively at scale.</p>
        <p>Building on this foundation, we plan to develop a series of dashboards to monitor the state of the scholarly record over time. These dashboards will feature both work-level and member-level statistics (for example, how many works of a given type have been registered, or how many members are registering grant IDs) as well as more detailed insights at the relationship level (for example, how many bibliographic references have been automatically matched, or how many times ROR IDs are included in funder assertions). Some of these <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jYXAILYgGWth-1lJhsJZPJJVSpyydenjK6E8fL4r1q0/edit?gid=2029795659#gid=2029795659" target="_blank">statistics are already available</a> in a public spreadsheet for now, pending the dashboard.</p>
        <h3 id="retraction-watch-integration">Retraction Watch integration</h3>
        <p>In 2023, Crossref <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9" target="_blank">acquired the Retraction Watch database</a> to make it open data. Initially, this was done through sharing simple CSV files, but this year we have set up a pipeline to feed this information into our REST API, which means that Retraction Watch data is now fully available through the REST API, integrated with Crossref member-supplied retraction and correction metadata. This is the first example of Crossref integrating third-party metadata, and we&rsquo;re learning a lot about how to best incorporate other datasets in future.</p>
        <h3 id="metadata-api-and-services-improvements">Metadata API and services improvements</h3>
        <p>From 1 December 2025, we <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/wadve-3tj60" target="_blank">revised rate limits for the REST API</a> to ensure system stability whilst maintaining free access to metadata for everyone. Changes were made to the rate limits for our ‘public’ and ‘polite’ APIs, while the limits for our Metadata Plus users stayed the same. We continue to make all metadata openly available to the whole community.</p>
        <p>We also improved how information from our content system feeds into the REST API. A tool we call ‘pusher’&mdash;because it pushes information from the content system to the REST API&mdash;was rebuilt so that we now have a more reliable transfer of information between our two systems.</p>
        <p>While adding to technical improvements, we’ve also worked to better understand the use of and streamline the service offering for paid options. We’ll share more about this year’s Metadata Plus consultation soon. And based on feedback, we have already retired the ‘Query Affiliate’ service, where a handful of organisations still paid us a fee to access our XML API, whereas no credentials have been required for some time.</p>
        <h2 id="strategic-theme-3-manage-crossref-openly-and-sustainably-modernising-and-making-transparent-all-operations-so-that-we-are-accountable-to-the-communities-that-govern-us">Strategic theme 3: Manage Crossref openly and sustainably, modernising and making transparent all operations so that we are accountable to the communities that govern us</h2>
        <h3 id="infrastructure-modernisation">Infrastructure modernisation</h3>
        <div class="shortcode-divwrap align-left">
        <span><figure class="img-responsive"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/data-centre-out.jpg"
        alt="Saying goodbye to the Crossref data centre" width="100%">
        </figure>
        </span>
        </div>
        <p>One of our biggest projects of 2025&mdash;if not <strong>the</strong> biggest&mdash;was the move from our data centre into the cloud (AWS). For 25 years, Crossref had been running a physical data centre in Massachusetts, USA, but as part of modernising our systems, it was high time to move everything into the cloud. The move to AWS took several months, but <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/wd6rx-vpq73" target="_blank">we successfully completed this move to the cloud</a> in July this year. We’re spending these last weeks of 2025 fully decommissioning our data centre, which means that we are removing all the equipment we had there and locking the door for the last time.</p>
        <p>A part of the move to AWS included moving onto an open-source database solution, PostgreSQL. This reduced our reliance on closed, costly licensed solutions, while also aligning with our POSI commitment to open-source. Running our entire system in AWS provides a more stable, modern approach to our infrastructure, but it also is expensive. We expect to spend about 2 million USD on AWS fees next year, with the majority of this cost coming from REST API usage. Some of the improvements described above will help us manage those costs and better observe traffic patterns.</p>
        <p>Our new cloud infrastructure is a bittersweet milestone: while we are happy to not have to rely on a physical presence to support a 24/7 global infrastructure, we also say a sad farewell of our much-loved and long-suffering Sys Admin, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/tim-pickard/">Tim Pickard</a>, who has been with Crossref since 2002, and has contributed significantly and unwaveringly to keeping our system up and running in the data centre. Tim will be leaving Crossref at the end of the year; we’re grateful to Tim for all his years of dedication, and we will greatly miss his impressive Hawaiian shirt game on our all-staff calls.</p>
        <p>After 25 years, it was also time to get serious about modernising our core content system, because even though it serves our community well, an older system with legacy code is a constant risk and frustration. We’ve therefore embarked on a multi-year modernisation project where we are replacing our old code piece by piece. We no longer want to have one big content system (a monolith), but are planning to identify different pieces of functionality and rebuild these as separate services (a modular, flexible, and robust approach). This year, we already managed to reconstruct some smaller pieces (for example, the ‘pusher’ mentioned above), and next year we will tackle larger projects, such as Metadata Matching and Authentication.</p>
        <p>We continue to prioritise open, timely communication for planned or unplanned service interruptions and encourage everyone to monitor our status page at <a href="https://status.crossref.org" target="_blank">status.crossref.org</a>. We’ll further hone our incident response processes in 2026, including openly posting incident reviews, and we’ll also centre system maintenance and documentation clarity in everything we do.</p>
        <h3 id="rcfs-projects">RCFS Projects</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability projects (RCFS)</a> and the work of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/">Membership &amp; Fees Committee</a> resulted in deciding not to change some things (such as the <em>basis</em> for annual membership fees), but to <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10" target="_blank">change three things about our fees, as reported in July</a>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A new lower membership fee tier of 200 USD for members with annual revenues/expenses of under 1000 USD - so far, this includes around 3000 members. <a href="#membership-growth-efficiencies-and-accessibility">See below</a> for more info.</li>
        <li>A removal of volume discounts to reduce complexity in our billing code; they were little used, and those who did use these were fine with the loss of the discount.</li>
        <li>A removal of the rule that only publishers of a title could register peer review reports (including comments and annotations) at the lower 0.25 USD fee for the first review; this lower fee is now available to any member to register any reviews of any other members’ works.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A new late-breaking addition to these fee decisions is the reduction of fees for members registering Grant IDs. As of January 1st 2026, there will be no fee for back-year (BY) grant registration, to encourage the faster adoption of older grants, which are more likely to have research outputs to be matched. This will be a two-year pilot to trial how a reduced fee incentivises adoption and boosts metadata connections, and could be extended to other record types as we monitor its success and sustainability. In addition, the 2 USD fee per current-year (CY) grant record is being reduced to 1 USD in line with the next-nearest fee, this is a permanent change for the foreseeable future. More on this change in January.</p>
        <h3 id="membership-growth-efficiencies-and-accessibility">Membership growth, efficiencies, and accessibility</h3>
        <p>Crossref now serves 23,600 members across 164 countries, with continued growth particularly in Asia and Latin America. We&rsquo;ve continued our ongoing member onboarding activities to support new members joining the community. We see around 230 new members join each month, and have welcomed 2,700 this year so far. We recently reported on how the <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/tch5n-9px70" target="_blank">shape of membership has evolved over our 25 years</a> of operation.</p>
        <p>From January 2026, we&rsquo;re introducing a <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/j2bgz-v7h50" target="_blank">new lower membership fee tier</a> of 200 USD for organisations with annual revenue or expenses of 1,000 USD or less, making membership more accessible to low-resourced organisations. Already, over 3000 members have been eligible to move into or join under that fee, and the idea is to monitor how this affects Crossref’s financial sustainability and potentially adjust the 200 USD annual fee down again in future years.</p>
        <p>From 1 January 2026, the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">GEM program, which offers fee-free membership and content registration for all members from certain countries, will expand</a> to include 19 additional countries, further reducing financial barriers to participation in the scholarly record, so we expect several hundred further members to join the existing 600 organisations in this category.</p>
        <p>As our membership base continues to grow, the Membership and Finance teams are constantly exploring ways to make shared processes more efficient. A key component in this work has been the efforts to automate several tasks within both teams to help us manage the additional work caused by our growth and allow our teams to focus more on providing the best quality service we can.</p>
        <p>In March, the board voted to <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/dtrvw-8cm10" target="_blank">update membership terms and bylaws</a> to clarify processes for suspending and revoking membership, and to be more explicit about <a href="https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/member-practices/">member practices that preserve the integrity of the scholarly record</a>. A short-term Member Practices Working Group will be meeting in the first half of 2026 to draft these.</p>
        <p>Our membership team continues to support our members, sponsors, service providers, metadata users and the wider community by email and through our <a href="https://community.crossref.org/" target="_blank">community forum</a>. The membership team includes staff members who focus on member support, and staff members who focus on technical support. During 2025 so far, we’ve received 36.8k member enquiries through our support system, a 17% increase from last year. This includes 22.6k inquiries related to general membership and 13k technical support enquiries. We’ve received 3.8k membership applications, and welcomed 2.7k new members.</p>
        <h3 id="growth-by-the-numbers">Growth by the numbers</h3>
        <p>Crossref continues its steady revenue growth in 2025 due to the expansion of our membership base. With the addition of new members and the general growth of Crossref, comes an increase in the transaction-based tasks our Finance team handles.</p>
        <p>So far in 2025 we have issued 14,833 invoices, which is a 9% increase since last year. We’ve seen an 11% increase in the number of payments received and applied, and a 12% increase in the amount of credit and debit memos applied over the same time last year. We have also seen a 42% increase in the number of billing-related tickets, totalling 20,723. A large segment of these tickets are related to fee updates associated with the new $200 membership tier.</p>
        <p>Not all transactional work in Finance has increased as steadily, with increased revenue of 8% we have also seen a 14% increase in operating expenses. Through the strategic consolidation of vendors and use of financial tools, we have only seen a 1% increase in Accounts Payable invoices processed.</p>
        <h3 id="organisational-sustainability">Organisational sustainability</h3>
        <p>Finance-wise, we’re doing well. We’re projecting to finish this year with revenue of 14,200,000 USD and expect revenue next year of 14,500,000 USD. We’re budgeting 2% growth in overall revenue, accounting for some of the changes to fees that will reduce our earnings on membership dues, but anticipating continued growth of content registration revenue.</p>
        <figure class="img-responsive"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/financials/2024-YE-overall.jpg"
        alt="A chart showing Crossref&#39;s Revenue and expenses over the years" width="100%"><figcaption>
        <p>Revenue and expenses trends</p>
        </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>About 67% of our expenses come from personnel costs, and the other 33% include non-personnel costs like AWS, travel, legal fees, etc. As we continue to build out the team, we have ten new positions planned for the next year (recruitment for many of these is already underway or done). With additional staff roles and AWS expenses, we’re expecting expense growth of 16%. We post our financial statements and Form 990 filings on the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/financials">financials page on our website</a>.</p>
        <figure class="img-responsive"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/financials/2024-rev-by-tier.jpg"
        alt="A chart showing revenue per member size (by tier) with smallest members providing highest revenue" width="100%"><figcaption>
        <p>Revenue per member size (by tier)</p>
        </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As the chart above shows, we still &rsquo;the long tail&rsquo; of members in the smallest category (275 USD) contributing more revenue than those in the largest category (50,000 USD) at 5.8 million USD versus 5 million USD.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of sustainability is our impact on the world around us. And this year we were able to publish a second <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/4yc7f-4h586" target="_blank">report on Crossref’s carbon footprint</a>, having monitored and controlled for several carbon-heavy activities, primarily staff travel. Our reported emissions went up 40% from 2023 to 2024, due to more travel given our growth in staff and members, better recording our emissions (for example, with hotel stays), and including travel that we support for our partners, ambassadors and board members. In terms of travel spending, we are still well below 2019 when we were smaller, demonstrating that we are following through on not going back to the pre-pandemic norm.</p>
        <p>We were one of the first open infrastructure organisations to adopt the POSI Principles and now have a few years’ experience in trying to meet them. Together with other adopters, we <a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/6148078" target="_blank">proposed updates and additions to the principles</a>, based on real-world practice, and gathered a lot of community comment, resulting in the group <a href="https://doi.org/10.14454/G8WV-VM65" target="_blank">publishing POSI v2</a> in October. We conduct a <a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/posi">self-assessment</a> every other year and we’ll be involving all our staff in the next self-assessment, due later in 2026.</p>
        <h3 id="open-governance-through-board-election-and-annual-meeting">Open governance through board election and annual meeting</h3>
        <p>We continued our commitment to being member-led and community-driven. This year’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/0team-dyy285" target="_blank">anniversary Annual Meeting</a> in October brought together members to discuss strategy, metadata developments, and hear the results of their voting in our board election. It comprised two half-days of online conferencing and several in-person satellite meetings spread across five continents, gathering close to 500 members of our community. It was a platform to reflect together on the past quarter of the century of building community infrastructure and connections underpinning the progress of scholarship, and to share plans for the future.</p>
        <p>Each member has one vote, and together they elected the following organisations to serve a three-year term alongside the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#board-members">rest of the board</a>:</p>
        <p>Tier 1 candidates (electing one seat):</p>

        <h3 id="team-structure">Team structure</h3>
        <p>We reorganised the team heading into 2025 because we had ambitious goals that required a more structured, collaborative approach. We reorganised the work around three strategic, mission-driven areas of focus described above. This was our first full year with the <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/4s2ee-wkr84" target="_blank">cross-functional program groups</a> in place, and the activities reported here make it evident that our team members, both existing and new, are firing on all cylinders.</p>
        <h3 id="new-staff-and-new-roles">New staff and new roles</h3>
        <p>We welcomed eight new team members in 2025. In February, we welcomed our new Director of Programs &amp; Services, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/helena-cousijn">Helena Cousijn</a>, and a new member of the Technical Support team, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/arley-soto">Arley Soto</a>. In March, we welcomed our new Community Manager for funders, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/roc%C3%ADo-gaudioso-pedraza">Rocío Gaudioso Pedraza</a>. In April, we <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/6e4f8-3yj41" target="_blank">launched our new Data Science team</a> by welcoming <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/jason-portenoy">Jason Portenoy</a> and <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/alex-b%C3%A9dard-vall%C3%A9e">Alex Bédard-Vallée</a>. In November, we welcomed our new DevOps Engineer, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/thelma-laryea">Thelma Laryea,</a> and our new Program Technical Lead for the OSO program, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/bharath-govindarajan">Bharath Govindarajan.</a> In December, we welcomed another member of the Technical Support team, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/natali-giorgobiani">Natali Giorgobiani</a>.</p>
        <p>We also had team members step up into new roles. <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/dominika-tkaczyk">Dominika Tkaczyk</a> completed the new leadership team by taking on the Director of Technology role, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/paul-davis">Paul Davis </a>has started his new role as Product Manager, and <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/michelle-cancel/">Michelle Cancel</a> has taken on the Head of Human Resources role. And there’s more to come! As next year begins, two team members will step into Program Technical Lead roles: <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/carlos-del-ojo-elias">Carlos del Ojo Elias</a> for the CRN program and <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/patrick-vale">Patrick Vale</a> for the CCT program. Together with the Program Technical Lead for the OSO program and the Head of Infrastructure Services, these roles will complete the new structure of the technology team. This structure is more closely aligned with how our work is organised and will enable stronger coordination both within and across cross-functional programs.</p>
        <h3 id="supporting-a-thriving-global-culture">Supporting a thriving global culture</h3>
        <p>As our team grows in different aspects within our new <a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/org-chart/">org structure</a> to meet the needs of the community, we remain committed to supporting a thriving culture through training, conducting regular temperature checks, and organising our annual staff retreat. This year, we continued our work on psychological safety and introduced workshops on giving and receiving feedback and on consensus building. We were able to put some of this training into practice at our in-person all-staff event in Split, Croatia, where we all came together to <a href="https://roadmap.productboard.com/e6fdeba8-a5b3-4aef-8104-d48863ba975e" target="_blank">build our roadmap</a>.</p>
        <p>We are ending the year with 51 staff in 14 countries and look forward to diversifying and evolving even further as a team in 2026&mdash;we’re currently hiring in UX, Communications, and Membership&mdash;and keep an eye on our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/jobs">jobs</a> page for forthcoming opportunities in Software, DevOps, Metadata, and Operations!</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Thank you to our community of members, partners, board, ambassadors, sponsors, metadata users, service providers, integrators—and of course our team—for making 2025 such a productive year. Together, we&rsquo;re building a richer, more connected research ecosystem for the benefit of society. We can’t wait to continue the work together in 2026.</p>]]>
      </description>
      <source:markdown>As we finish [celebrating our 25th anniversary](https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/25years/), we can look back on a truly transformational year, defined by the successful delivery of several long-planned, foundational projects—as well as updates to our teams, services, and fees—that position Crossref for success over the next quarter century as essential open scholarly infrastructure. In our [update at the end of 2024](https://doi.org/10.64000/bm6g0-gvy36), we highlighted that we had restructured our leadership team and paused some projects. The changes made in 2024 positioned us for a year of getting things done in 2025. We launched cross-functional programs, modernised our systems, strengthened connections with our growing global community, and streamlined a bunch of technical and business operations while continuing to grow our staff, members, content, relationships, and community connections.

Read on for the highlights of a very busy year, grouped around our [four strategic themes](https://www.crossref.org/strategy/).

## Strategic theme 1: Contribute to an environment where the community identifies and co-creates solutions for broad benefit

### Enhanced tools and services

In October, we released an [enhanced Participation Reports dashboard](https://doi.org/10.64000/8d5ga-2n897) that shows metadata coverage across all 180 million records and provides individual member organisations with actionable gap reports to guide them to improve metadata completeness. The new tool provides more complete coverage of all members and resource types, now including funders and grants, with up to 11 best-practice metadata elements publicly tracked.

We launched support for journal articles in the [New Metadata Manager record registration form](https://manage.crossref.org/) (initially only for grants), which includes built-in reference and relationships deposit capabilities. In the New Metadata Manager, it’s now also possible to search for previously registered DOIs to edit your metadata records. In the coming years, we are planning to expand the new Metadata Manager to support all the many different content types that you can register with Crossref DOIs.

After a long break between regular updates, we have fixed our process for and [just released v.1.63 of the Open Funder registry](https://gitlab.com/crossref/open_funder_registry). With the updated process, we’re now able to resume more frequent updates to the registry (while of course still working towards the transition to ROR for funders).

Throughout 2025, we conducted a website information architecture review to improve the information we provide to our members and the wider community. Based on the recommendations from this review, we will be renewing our website and documentation in 2026.

### Deprecations and modernisation

‘Old’ Metadata Manager is to be [retired at the end of 2025](https://doi.org/10.64000/ys7s6-pwn71), with users transitioning to the ‘New’ version or to our other helper tools for registering and updating DOIs. All users have been contacted during 2025 and received [training on how to use the New Metadata Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN3M90LKNqs).

We also [announced the deprecation of Co-access](https://doi.org/10.64000/w6pw6-c7y02), which will end in 2026, bringing an end to the service that allowed duplicate DOIs for book content. Users of co-access have been informed and are in the process of transitioning to [multiple resolution](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/creating-and-managing-dois/multiple-resolution/).

Together with Turnitin and our members, we are working to transition all subscribers to our Similarity Check service to a new version of iThenticate 2.0. We are happy to report that all platforms with integrations with us transitioned to 2.0 during 2025, and we will continue working with our members to get everyone transitioned during 2026.

### Eating our own DOI dogfood

In June this year, we were particularly pleased to finally [support the registration of DOIs for our own content, this very blog](https://doi.org/10.64000/552ec-b8g03), through partnering with Rogue Scholar. Blogs are a growing format for scholarly discourse and our own blog is no different as it’s the main way that we share guidelines and best practices, as well as news and stories from the scholarly community. With a Crossref DOI for all blogs going back to 2006, we’re setting ourselves up to ensure better future preservation of the discussion and information about Crossref.

### Community connections

We delivered 29 metadata health-check webinars over the course of the year, in French, Indonesian, Spanish, and English, reaching 2,166 participants with practical advice on identifying gaps in journal metadata using [Participation Reports](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/).

[Crossref Accra](https://doi.org/10.64000/x38ew-0n632) took place in March as our first in-person event in a [GEM](https://www.crossref.org/gem/) country. We also held similar events in Ecuador and Türkiye with [Crossref Quito](https://zenodo.org/records/17251274) in September and [Crossref Ankara](https://zenodo.org/records/17952555) in November. At these three events, we welcomed key figures from each country’s library, government, publishing, and academic communities and we learned so much about the thriving communities there, and also that even more dedicated workshops on the specifics of metadata quality improvements would be appreciated.

Our [metadata sprint in Madrid](https://www.crossref.org/events/metadata-sprint/) in April brought together community members to tackle specific problems collaboratively, with teams exploring coding, documentation, translation, and research using our open metadata. We’re already planning our [next sprint in São Paulo](https://www.crossref.org/events/metadata-sprint/) for March 2026, and it will be held in three languages: Portuguese, Spanish, and English.

A strategic goal for Crossref is to grow research funders’ adoption of the [Grant Linking System](https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/), and we produced the first in a series of interviews with funder members this year to highlight how and why Crossref DOIs are fulfilling goals to assess the reach and return of their research support for [FWF](https://doi.org/10.64000/n9n69-y5b75) (Austria), [NWO](https://doi.org/10.64000/dvqke-j4v69) (Netherlands), [FCCN\|FCT](https://doi.org/10.64000/9gjfp-5p698) (Portugal), and [Wellcome](https://doi.org/10.64000/c1dh8-qn968). This year, we welcomed more funders including Fonds de recherche du Québec (Canada) and Independent Research Fund Denmark as part of their national research platform NORA; we look forward to reporting on their experiences and outcomes next year and others as they work towards Crossref Grant DOI adoption.

We continued working closely with PKP and [renewed our partnership to help drive better experience for OJS users](https://doi.org/10.64000/r2zgm-99706) registering metadata with Crossref. We also delivered a proportion of the metadata health-checks together to maximise the learning opportunities for our members using OJS; and we joined PKP Sprint in Oslo to help make improvements to OJS and OMP.

Crossref staff members serve on almost 50 committees, boards, and other community bodies alongside our own direct work. These include in the areas of research integrity, metascience, metadata and PID standards, open science policy or monitoring, development of new models (such as Diamond OA), editorial production, library and institutional publishing, and citation and other metadata analyses. We also work with other DOI Registration Agencies and support the sustainability of the DOI Foundation with an additional annual subsidy. Many DOI RAs are also Crossref Sponsors so that their members can access our unique reference matching service. While we often might advise, we also learn a huge amount from collaborating with the numerous systems and initiatives that make up thw wider research community.

Our involvement with developing the [Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information](https://barcelona-declaration.org/) led us to become the fiscal host and to participate in most of the working groups on open metadata. Of particular note this year was the Funding Metadata Working Group round table about [moving forward the state of funding metadata](https://barcelona-declaration.org/news/20251023_community_roundtable/), which we co-hosted with Barcelona Declaration colleagues, and three funding bodies, NWO (Netherlands), FWF (Austria), and ANR (France) as we heard from publishers and their vendors about challenges and how to overcome them to increase the quantity and quality of available open funding metadata.

All our community engagement activities have been enthusiastically supported and enriched by our indispensable [Ambassadors](https://www.crossref.org/community/our-ambassadors/) and our group of now 130 [Sponsors](https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/), organisations that help thousands of Crossref members with local language and technical support and lower cost access to our membership.

## Strategic theme 2: A sustainable source of complete, open, and global scholarly metadata and relationships

### Schema developments

The [grant schema version 0.2.0 was released in January](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/grants-schema/), adding support for ROR identifiers to identify funders and new funding types for in our taxonomy, including APC, BPC, and infrastructure. All of these funding types can be specified in the metadata of our grant-giving members alongside the existing types such as use of facilities or salary/training awards, etc.

Version [5.4 of our publications schema was released in March](https://doi.org/10.13003/325070), marking our first update in many years and a great opportunity to learn how to do this and make the process more efficient. This release introduced typed references to denote the type of object referenced (dataset, blog, software, etc.), preprint status indicators, and version numbering.

Just last week, we also added a dedicated field for [grant DOIs to our publications schema](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/markup-guide-metadata-segments/funding-information). This means it’s now possible to indicate in an article’s metadata which grant(s) funded the research using the persistent identifier. This is an essential step toward better alignment between grant funding and research, enriching the Research Nexus.

We also launched our new [Metadata Advisory Group](https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/metadata-advisory/) and they have already devised sub-working groups in the three focus topic areas:

- Multilingual metadata
- Subjects and keywords
- Relationships

### Public data file

We released the [2025 public data file](https://doi.org/10.13003/614659) in March, containing metadata for (at the time) over 165 million research outputs from more than 22,000 organisations.

### Inaugural Metadata Awards

In May, we launched the [first-ever Metadata Awards](https://doi.org/10.64000/xh94q-w7335) to recognise members demonstrating excellence in metadata completeness and enrichment. Winners included [Noyam Publishers](https://doi.org/10.64000/v2v2s-r9037) (Ghana), [GigaScience Press](https://doi.org/10.64000/z2qhj-7nd90) (Hong Kong), [eLife](https://doi.org/10.64000/3gcdf-23s29) (UK), [American Society for Microbiology](https://doi.org/10.64000/xxwy3-xhf38) (USA), [Universidad La Salle Arequipa](https://doi.org/10.64000/51bv6-89j85) (Peru), and [Instituto Geologico y Minero de España](https://doi.org/10.64000/hkxmk-5qe50) (Spain). The awards will be held biennially going forward.

### Metadata Matching project

In April, we launched the [metadata matching](https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/metadata-matching/) project with the aim of building a more complete picture of [the research nexus](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/) over time by automatically identifying missing relationships between entities across the scholarly record. The project’s goal is to modernise Crossref’s enrichment workflows by rebuilding them using modern software development and data science practices.

We are in the throws of developing a consolidated matching workflow that will eventually replace all existing production matching processes, with results exposed through the REST API. All new matching strategies will be rigorously evaluated, and the resulting data will be accompanied by clear provenance information. This project covers six matching tasks:

- bibliographic reference matching
- funder name matching
- preprint matching
- affiliation matching
- grant matching
- title matching

In the meantime, while work continues on integrating matching results into the REST API, we’ve been releasing standalone matching datasets for separate download and analysis. These include [relationships between preprints and journal articles](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15124417), [relationships involving research organisations](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15254993), and [relationships between grants and research outputs](https://doi.org/10.13003/waej1een).

### Data infrastructure and Research Nexus participation dashboard

Staying on the data science front, we’ve established an internal data environment that combines all relevant data sources (scholarly metadata, logs and usage data, and external datasets) in their raw forms into a single place. This environment is supported by a suite of modern tools and data processing techniques, enabling data science experiments and analytics pipelines to run effectively at scale.

Building on this foundation, we plan to develop a series of dashboards to monitor the state of the scholarly record over time. These dashboards will feature both work-level and member-level statistics (for example, how many works of a given type have been registered, or how many members are registering grant IDs) as well as more detailed insights at the relationship level (for example, how many bibliographic references have been automatically matched, or how many times ROR IDs are included in funder assertions). Some of these [statistics are already available](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jYXAILYgGWth-1lJhsJZPJJVSpyydenjK6E8fL4r1q0/edit?gid=2029795659#gid=2029795659) in a public spreadsheet for now, pending the dashboard.

### Retraction Watch integration

In 2023, Crossref [acquired the Retraction Watch database](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9) to make it open data. Initially, this was done through sharing simple CSV files, but this year we have set up a pipeline to feed this information into our REST API, which means that Retraction Watch data is now fully available through the REST API, integrated with Crossref member-supplied retraction and correction metadata. This is the first example of Crossref integrating third-party metadata, and we’re learning a lot about how to best incorporate other datasets in future.

### Metadata API and services improvements

From 1 December 2025, we [revised rate limits for the REST API](https://doi.org/10.64000/wadve-3tj60) to ensure system stability whilst maintaining free access to metadata for everyone. Changes were made to the rate limits for our ‘public’ and ‘polite’ APIs, while the limits for our Metadata Plus users stayed the same. We continue to make all metadata openly available to the whole community.

We also improved how information from our content system feeds into the REST API. A tool we call ‘pusher’—because it pushes information from the content system to the REST API—was rebuilt so that we now have a more reliable transfer of information between our two systems.

While adding to technical improvements, we’ve also worked to better understand the use of and streamline the service offering for paid options. We’ll share more about this year’s Metadata Plus consultation soon. And based on feedback, we have already retired the ‘Query Affiliate’ service, where a handful of organisations still paid us a fee to access our XML API, whereas no credentials have been required for some time.

## Strategic theme 3: Manage Crossref openly and sustainably, modernising and making transparent all operations so that we are accountable to the communities that govern us

### Infrastructure modernisation

![Saying goodbye to the Crossref data centre](https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/data-centre-out.jpg)

One of our biggest projects of 2025—if not **the** biggest—was the move from our data centre into the cloud (AWS). For 25 years, Crossref had been running a physical data centre in Massachusetts, USA, but as part of modernising our systems, it was high time to move everything into the cloud. The move to AWS took several months, but [we successfully completed this move to the cloud](https://doi.org/10.64000/wd6rx-vpq73) in July this year. We’re spending these last weeks of 2025 fully decommissioning our data centre, which means that we are removing all the equipment we had there and locking the door for the last time.

A part of the move to AWS included moving onto an open-source database solution, PostgreSQL. This reduced our reliance on closed, costly licensed solutions, while also aligning with our POSI commitment to open-source. Running our entire system in AWS provides a more stable, modern approach to our infrastructure, but it also is expensive. We expect to spend about 2 million USD on AWS fees next year, with the majority of this cost coming from REST API usage. Some of the improvements described above will help us manage those costs and better observe traffic patterns.

Our new cloud infrastructure is a bittersweet milestone: while we are happy to not have to rely on a physical presence to support a 24/7 global infrastructure, we also say a sad farewell of our much-loved and long-suffering Sys Admin, [Tim Pickard](https://www.crossref.org/people/tim-pickard/), who has been with Crossref since 2002, and has contributed significantly and unwaveringly to keeping our system up and running in the data centre. Tim will be leaving Crossref at the end of the year; we’re grateful to Tim for all his years of dedication, and we will greatly miss his impressive Hawaiian shirt game on our all-staff calls.

After 25 years, it was also time to get serious about modernising our core content system, because even though it serves our community well, an older system with legacy code is a constant risk and frustration. We’ve therefore embarked on a multi-year modernisation project where we are replacing our old code piece by piece. We no longer want to have one big content system (a monolith), but are planning to identify different pieces of functionality and rebuild these as separate services (a modular, flexible, and robust approach). This year, we already managed to reconstruct some smaller pieces (for example, the ‘pusher’ mentioned above), and next year we will tackle larger projects, such as Metadata Matching and Authentication.

We continue to prioritise open, timely communication for planned or unplanned service interruptions and encourage everyone to monitor our status page at [status.crossref.org](https://status.crossref.org). We’ll further hone our incident response processes in 2026, including openly posting incident reviews, and we’ll also centre system maintenance and documentation clarity in everything we do.

### RCFS Projects

The [Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability projects (RCFS)](https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/) and the work of our [Membership &#38; Fees Committee](https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/) resulted in deciding not to change some things (such as the _basis_ for annual membership fees), but to [change three things about our fees, as reported in July](https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10):

- A new lower membership fee tier of 200 USD for members with annual revenues/expenses of under 1000 USD - so far, this includes around 3000 members. [See below](#membership-growth-efficiencies-and-accessibility) for more info.
- A removal of volume discounts to reduce complexity in our billing code; they were little used, and those who did use these were fine with the loss of the discount.
- A removal of the rule that only publishers of a title could register peer review reports (including comments and annotations) at the lower 0.25 USD fee for the first review; this lower fee is now available to any member to register any reviews of any other members’ works.

A new late-breaking addition to these fee decisions is the reduction of fees for members registering Grant IDs. As of January 1st 2026, there will be no fee for back-year (BY) grant registration, to encourage the faster adoption of older grants, which are more likely to have research outputs to be matched. This will be a two-year pilot to trial how a reduced fee incentivises adoption and boosts metadata connections, and could be extended to other record types as we monitor its success and sustainability. In addition, the 2 USD fee per current-year (CY) grant record is being reduced to 1 USD in line with the next-nearest fee, this is a permanent change for the foreseeable future. More on this change in January.

### Membership growth, efficiencies, and accessibility

Crossref now serves 23,600 members across 164 countries, with continued growth particularly in Asia and Latin America. We’ve continued our ongoing member onboarding activities to support new members joining the community. We see around 230 new members join each month, and have welcomed 2,700 this year so far. We recently reported on how the [shape of membership has evolved over our 25 years](https://doi.org/10.64000/tch5n-9px70) of operation.

From January 2026, we’re introducing a [new lower membership fee tier](https://doi.org/10.64000/j2bgz-v7h50) of 200 USD for organisations with annual revenue or expenses of 1,000 USD or less, making membership more accessible to low-resourced organisations. Already, over 3000 members have been eligible to move into or join under that fee, and the idea is to monitor how this affects Crossref’s financial sustainability and potentially adjust the 200 USD annual fee down again in future years.

From 1 January 2026, the [GEM program, which offers fee-free membership and content registration for all members from certain countries, will expand](https://www.crossref.org/gem/) to include 19 additional countries, further reducing financial barriers to participation in the scholarly record, so we expect several hundred further members to join the existing 600 organisations in this category.

As our membership base continues to grow, the Membership and Finance teams are constantly exploring ways to make shared processes more efficient. A key component in this work has been the efforts to automate several tasks within both teams to help us manage the additional work caused by our growth and allow our teams to focus more on providing the best quality service we can.

In March, the board voted to [update membership terms and bylaws](https://doi.org/10.64000/dtrvw-8cm10) to clarify processes for suspending and revoking membership, and to be more explicit about [member practices that preserve the integrity of the scholarly record](https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/member-practices/). A short-term Member Practices Working Group will be meeting in the first half of 2026 to draft these.

Our membership team continues to support our members, sponsors, service providers, metadata users and the wider community by email and through our [community forum](https://community.crossref.org/). The membership team includes staff members who focus on member support, and staff members who focus on technical support. During 2025 so far, we’ve received 36.8k member enquiries through our support system, a 17% increase from last year. This includes 22.6k inquiries related to general membership and 13k technical support enquiries. We’ve received 3.8k membership applications, and welcomed 2.7k new members.

### Growth by the numbers

Crossref continues its steady revenue growth in 2025 due to the expansion of our membership base. With the addition of new members and the general growth of Crossref, comes an increase in the transaction-based tasks our Finance team handles.

So far in 2025 we have issued 14,833 invoices, which is a 9% increase since last year. We’ve seen an 11% increase in the number of payments received and applied, and a 12% increase in the amount of credit and debit memos applied over the same time last year. We have also seen a 42% increase in the number of billing-related tickets, totalling 20,723. A large segment of these tickets are related to fee updates associated with the new $200 membership tier.

Not all transactional work in Finance has increased as steadily, with increased revenue of 8% we have also seen a 14% increase in operating expenses. Through the strategic consolidation of vendors and use of financial tools, we have only seen a 1% increase in Accounts Payable invoices processed.

### Organisational sustainability

Finance-wise, we’re doing well. We’re projecting to finish this year with revenue of 14,200,000 USD and expect revenue next year of 14,500,000 USD. We’re budgeting 2% growth in overall revenue, accounting for some of the changes to fees that will reduce our earnings on membership dues, but anticipating continued growth of content registration revenue.

![A chart showing Crossref&#39;s Revenue and expenses over the years](https://www.crossref.org/images/financials/2024-YE-overall.jpg)

Revenue and expenses trends

About 67% of our expenses come from personnel costs, and the other 33% include non-personnel costs like AWS, travel, legal fees, etc. As we continue to build out the team, we have ten new positions planned for the next year (recruitment for many of these is already underway or done). With additional staff roles and AWS expenses, we’re expecting expense growth of 16%. We post our financial statements and Form 990 filings on the [financials page on our website](https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/financials).

![A chart showing revenue per member size (by tier) with smallest members providing highest revenue](https://www.crossref.org/images/financials/2024-rev-by-tier.jpg)

Revenue per member size (by tier)

As the chart above shows, we still ’the long tail’ of members in the smallest category (275 USD) contributing more revenue than those in the largest category (50,000 USD) at 5.8 million USD versus 5 million USD.

Another aspect of sustainability is our impact on the world around us. And this year we were able to publish a second [report on Crossref’s carbon footprint](https://doi.org/10.64000/4yc7f-4h586), having monitored and controlled for several carbon-heavy activities, primarily staff travel. Our reported emissions went up 40% from 2023 to 2024, due to more travel given our growth in staff and members, better recording our emissions (for example, with hotel stays), and including travel that we support for our partners, ambassadors and board members. In terms of travel spending, we are still well below 2019 when we were smaller, demonstrating that we are following through on not going back to the pre-pandemic norm.

We were one of the first open infrastructure organisations to adopt the POSI Principles and now have a few years’ experience in trying to meet them. Together with other adopters, we [proposed updates and additions to the principles](https://doi.org/10.13003/6148078), based on real-world practice, and gathered a lot of community comment, resulting in the group [publishing POSI v2](https://doi.org/10.14454/G8WV-VM65) in October. We conduct a [self-assessment](https://www.crossref.org/categories/posi) every other year and we’ll be involving all our staff in the next self-assessment, due later in 2026.

### Open governance through board election and annual meeting

We continued our commitment to being member-led and community-driven. This year’s [anniversary Annual Meeting](https://doi.org/10.64000/0team-dyy285) in October brought together members to discuss strategy, metadata developments, and hear the results of their voting in our board election. It comprised two half-days of online conferencing and several in-person satellite meetings spread across five continents, gathering close to 500 members of our community. It was a platform to reflect together on the past quarter of the century of building community infrastructure and connections underpinning the progress of scholarship, and to share plans for the future.

Each member has one vote, and together they elected the following organisations to serve a three-year term alongside the [rest of the board](https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/#board-members):

Tier 1 candidates (electing one seat):

- Rebecca Wambua, Distance, Open and e-Learning Practitioners’ Association of Kenya

Tier 2 candidates (electing four seats):

- Damian Bird, CABI
- Rose L’Huillier, Elsevier\*
- Anjalie Nawaratne, Springer Nature\*
- Nick Lindsay, The MIT Press\*

\*returning board member

Congratulations to the remaining and incoming board members as we start their new term in January 2026. Have a look at [all the outputs from our Annual Meeting](https://doi.org/10.13003/431937misogo).

## Strategic theme 4: Foster a strong team—because reliable infrastructure needs committed people who contribute to and realise the vision, and thrive doing it

### Team structure

We reorganised the team heading into 2025 because we had ambitious goals that required a more structured, collaborative approach. We reorganised the work around three strategic, mission-driven areas of focus described above. This was our first full year with the [cross-functional program groups](https://doi.org/10.64000/4s2ee-wkr84) in place, and the activities reported here make it evident that our team members, both existing and new, are firing on all cylinders.

### New staff and new roles

We welcomed eight new team members in 2025. In February, we welcomed our new Director of Programs &#38; Services, [Helena Cousijn](https://www.crossref.org/people/helena-cousijn), and a new member of the Technical Support team, [Arley Soto](https://www.crossref.org/people/arley-soto). In March, we welcomed our new Community Manager for funders, [Rocío Gaudioso Pedraza](https://www.crossref.org/people/roc%C3%ADo-gaudioso-pedraza). In April, we [launched our new Data Science team](https://doi.org/10.64000/6e4f8-3yj41) by welcoming [Jason Portenoy](https://www.crossref.org/people/jason-portenoy) and [Alex Bédard-Vallée](https://www.crossref.org/people/alex-b%C3%A9dard-vall%C3%A9e). In November, we welcomed our new DevOps Engineer, [Thelma Laryea,](https://www.crossref.org/people/thelma-laryea) and our new Program Technical Lead for the OSO program, [Bharath Govindarajan.](https://www.crossref.org/people/bharath-govindarajan) In December, we welcomed another member of the Technical Support team, [Natali Giorgobiani](https://www.crossref.org/people/natali-giorgobiani).

We also had team members step up into new roles. [Dominika Tkaczyk](https://www.crossref.org/people/dominika-tkaczyk) completed the new leadership team by taking on the Director of Technology role, [Paul Davis](https://www.crossref.org/people/paul-davis) has started his new role as Product Manager, and [Michelle Cancel](https://www.crossref.org/people/michelle-cancel/) has taken on the Head of Human Resources role. And there’s more to come! As next year begins, two team members will step into Program Technical Lead roles: [Carlos del Ojo Elias](https://www.crossref.org/people/carlos-del-ojo-elias) for the CRN program and [Patrick Vale](https://www.crossref.org/people/patrick-vale) for the CCT program. Together with the Program Technical Lead for the OSO program and the Head of Infrastructure Services, these roles will complete the new structure of the technology team. This structure is more closely aligned with how our work is organised and will enable stronger coordination both within and across cross-functional programs.

### Supporting a thriving global culture

As our team grows in different aspects within our new [org structure](https://www.crossref.org/people/org-chart/) to meet the needs of the community, we remain committed to supporting a thriving culture through training, conducting regular temperature checks, and organising our annual staff retreat. This year, we continued our work on psychological safety and introduced workshops on giving and receiving feedback and on consensus building. We were able to put some of this training into practice at our in-person all-staff event in Split, Croatia, where we all came together to [build our roadmap](https://roadmap.productboard.com/e6fdeba8-a5b3-4aef-8104-d48863ba975e).

We are ending the year with 51 staff in 14 countries and look forward to diversifying and evolving even further as a team in 2026—we’re currently hiring in UX, Communications, and Membership—and keep an eye on our [jobs](https://www.crossref.org/jobs) page for forthcoming opportunities in Software, DevOps, Metadata, and Operations!

* * *

Thank you to our community of members, partners, board, ambassadors, sponsors, metadata users, service providers, integrators—and of course our team—for making 2025 such a productive year. Together, we’re building a richer, more connected research ecosystem for the benefit of society. We can’t wait to continue the work together in 2026.</source:markdown>

      <title>Twenty-five years of Crossref: reflections from the 2025 annual meeting and board election</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/twenty-five-years-of-crossref-reflections-from-the-2025-annual-meeting-and-board-election/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Crossref turned twenty-five this year, and our 2025 Annual Meeting became more than a celebration—it was a shared moment to reflect on how far open scholarly infrastructure has come and where we, as a community, are heading next.</p>
        <p>Over two days in October, hundreds of participants joined online and in local satellite meetings in Madrid, Nairobi, Medan, Bogotá, Washington D.C., and London––a reminder that our community spans the globe. The meetings offered updates, community highlights, and a look at what’s ahead for our shared metadata network––including plans to connect funders, platforms, and AI tools across the global research ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Ed Pentz opened with thanks and perspective. He reflected on how it all began: twelve members, one shared goal — to make research easier to find and verify. 25 years later, the same goal underpins 174 million open metadata records, 1.9 billion citation links, and roughly 1.3 billion DOI resolutions each month. What started as reference linking is now a global network of relationships among people, institutions, and research outputs. Ed also reaffirmed <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a> as the foundation of our operations and our collaborations with other community-governed infrastructures.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Each number represents shared effort, trust, and long-term commitment,” Ed reminded us. “Open infrastructure works because people keep showing up.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="shared-perspectives-from-the-community">Shared perspectives from the community</h3>
        <p>We featured perspectives from organizations that have built key scholarly infrastructure alongside Crossref over the years. A shared message ran through their talks: open infrastructure only works when it’s interoperable, community-led, and practical for the people who use it.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=ZGOsAXGkryd-LKWy&amp;t=1953" target="_blank">Urooj Nizami (PKP)</a></strong> described PKP and Crossref as “independent and interdependent,” using the archipelago metaphor to show how open software and shared metadata services connect local publishing to a global network.</p>

        <h3 id="governance-and-election-results">Governance and election results</h3>
        <p>Leading off the formal annual meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=Gcjw0XERzNc45pRQ&amp;t=3826" target="_blank">Lisa Schiff, Chair of the Crossref Board, looked back on our 25th anniversary</a> as one marked by progress and problem-solving. She talked about moving all our systems to the cloud—a big step that makes the organization’s work faster and more reliable. She also spoke about ongoing efforts to maintain the research record&rsquo;s trustworthiness, including adding Retraction Watch data and updating member terms. Lisa noted new ways we are making membership more accessible, <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10" target="_blank">like the lower $200 tier</a> and the expansion of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">the GEM program</a>.</p>
        <p>Lucy Ofiesh brought it back to the role of the members themselves, reminding everyone that success still rests with its members. The annual meeting is when members directly influence Crossref’s direction––when each vote helps shape how we move forward together.</p>
        <p>We extend our thanks to the Board members whose terms have concluded, and we congratulate the newly elected members who will carry the work forward.</p>
        <p>Five directors were elected: Rebecca Wambua (Distance, Open and e-Learning Practitioners’ Association of Kenya), Damian Bird (CABI), Rose L’Huillier (Elsevier), Anjalie Nawaratne (Springer Nature), and Nick Lindsay (MIT Press).</p>

        </a></p>
        <p>We also thank the 2025 Nominating Committee for their thoughtful work guiding this year&rsquo;s process and slate selection.</p>
        <p>The Board plays an important role in making sure our governance remains community-led, transparent, and accountable. The volunteer members bring experience from research funders, publishers, and libraries, giving a balance of perspectives that help steer our long-term strategy and sustainability.</p>
        <h3 id="tools-in-practice">Tools in practice</h3>
        <p>Then our attention turned to the tools that many members use every day. Patrick Vale walked participants through updates to Participation Reports and the Record Registration Form— designed to make working with metadata simpler.</p>
        <figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/prep-la-salle.png"
        alt="Screenshot of a participation report for Universidad La Salle Arequipa in Peru, showing percentages per metadata element." width="100%"><figcaption>
        <p>Updated Participation Report for Universidad La Salle Arequipa (Peru), showing metadata element coverage percentages.</p>
        </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">Participation Reports</a>, first launched in 2018, have now been completely rebuilt as version 1.2. <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/8d5ga-2n897" target="_blank">The refreshed interface</a> runs on a new technology stack and supports morecontent types, and offers a new “download gap report” feature that generates a CSV list of records missing key fields—so members can identify and fix gaps directly.</p>
        <p>Patrick then demonstrated improvements to the Record Registration Form, now streamlined for creating as well as editing records. The form includes real-time validation, auto-fill options for journals previously used, and the ability to edit existing records directly. Members can now easily add abstracts, funding data, licenses, and affiliations linked to ORCID and ROR—all within one place.</p>
        <p>In the final demonstration, Luis Montilla, shared a “short research story”. He showed how anyone can explore Crossref metadata to uncover global participation patterns—turning what might seem like a mass of disconnected records into something meaningful once you start asking questions. He also shared a workflow that automatically retrieves and enriches data with country and regional information, then visualises member contributions and metadata coverage.</p>
        <p>Luis also demonstrated an interactive notebook that lets users explore participation trends through radar charts and other visuals—illustrating how open data can help the community understand and improve the completeness of the scholarly record.</p>
        <h3 id="crossref-then--now">Crossref then &amp; now</h3>
        <p>Amanda Bartell walked through how the community has changed over 25 years.</p>
        <figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/summary-growth-over-years-2025.png"
        alt="Image of statistics" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <p>The membership has broadened dramatically: universities and scholar-led groups now form the largest share, and more organizations in Asia and Latin America have joined (with big growth in Indonesia and Brazil). Most members are small: 98% qualify for the lowest fee tier, and 57% participate via a Sponsor. In support of including members from smaller economies, Crossref launched a GEM programme, which will be expanding to 19 new countries in 2026.</p>
        <p>She expanded her presentation later <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/tch5n-9px70" target="_blank">with a blog post to share insights about the changes in the Crossref global community</a>.</p>
        <p>With our growing membership, the needs of the community are evolving too, including expectations about Crossref’s role in preserving the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Our role in preserving the integrity of the scholarly record is focused on enriching the metadata to provide fuller and better trust signals while keeping barriers to participation low.” —Amanda Bartell, Crossref</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In response to the growing membership across the globe, we launched our Ambassadors program in 2018. Johanssen Obanda highlighted the activities of what is now 50 volunteers across 38 countries. Ambassadors act as local contacts—running training sessions, organizing events, translating materials, and providing feedback from their regions. Over the past year, they’ve led 41 activities reaching around 1,200 people. Many also contribute to GEM outreach, metadata health checks, and regional events—often in local languages.</p>

        <h3 id="roadmap-highlights">Roadmap highlights</h3>
        <p>Helena Cousijn outlined progress across three programs—Co-creation and Community Trends, Contributing to the Research Nexus, and Open and Sustainable Operations.
        Along with already showcased progress with Participation Reports and the new Record Registration Form, the Community Trends program involves working in partnership with others on DSpace integration and OJS plug-ins consolidation. In the near future there&rsquo;s also a consideration for piloting AI detection tools.
        The Contributing to Research Nexus program carried out a consultation with Metadata Plus subscribers, and develops a new data citations endpoint for the Crossref REST API. This team is also developing further matching services, in the first instance looking to match funder metadata to ROR IDs.</p>
        <p>Finally, Helena discussed the recent accomplishment of the Open and Sustainable Operations program, the migration of our database from the data centre to the cloud with Amazon Web Services. Other projects in this program involve ravamping resolution reports, rebuilding the Crossref authentication system, and launching new metadata schema.</p>
        <h3 id="resourcing-crossref-for-future-sustainability-rcfs">Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability (RCFS)</h3>
        <p>RCFS program is focused on equity, simplicity, and revenue balance. Kora shared recent developments and next steps:
        :
        A new $200 membership tier (for organizations with ≤$1,000 in publishing revenue/expenses) takes effect on January 1, 2026; more than 3,000 members have already moved into it.
        We will keep “publishing revenue/expenses” as the sizing basis for publishers while funder sizing is still under review.
        Volume discounts for content registration end on January 1, 2026.
        Backfile discounts for theses/dissertations and conference proceedings are under review.
        Peer-review fees are normalized at $0.25 for the first review of a work, with subsequent reviews (same member, same work) for free</p>
        <h3 id="behind-the-scenes-metadata-data-science">Behind the scenes: metadata, data science</h3>
        <p>Patricia Feeney reviewed recent and upcoming changes to our metadata schemas. Earlier this year, we began accepting ROR IDs as funder identifiers and released schema 5.4, which added versioning across all record types, a new status field for preprints, and a way to label citation types (like data sets, software, or blog posts).</p>
        <p>Coming soon, Crossref will add grant DOIs to funding metadata and release schema 5.5, which supports the CRediT contributor vocabulary and allows multiple contributor roles. A new grant schema will follow, including support for beneficiaries, project identifiers (like RAiD), and repeatable roles. Looking ahead to 2026, our plans to overhaul how names and organizations are modeled, add richer funding and data-availability statements, and expand abstract and multilingual metadata support. A new Metadata Advisory Group has also been formed to guide work on multilingual fields, subjects, keywords, and relationship modeling.</p>

        alt="Slide explaining that ROR can be supplied as a funder identifier, and listing updates to the Grants schema and schema 5.4." width="100%">
        </figure>
        <p>Finally, Patricia announced <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/zppnw-1se30" target="_blank">plans to deprecate older schemas</a>—a gradual, multi-year process—to simplify and modernize our metadata structure. She highlighted the importance of stronger relationships, richer records, and practical improvements that make metadata more useful across the community. That focus on connection carried directly into the next session about building through data science.</p>
        <h3 id="data-science-at-crossref">Data science at Crossref</h3>
        <p>Dominika Tkaczyk introduced the new data science team, formed a few months ago as part of the technology group. The team was created because of the growing scale and complexity of the data Crossref manages, driven by the expanding scholarly community. Their role is to use data science to assess, improve, and enrich scholarly metadata.</p>
        <p>Their work falls into two areas: data analysis and insights—to help Crossref understand the scholarly record and guide decisions—and data services and workflows—to apply data science in building and maintaining production systems. Examples include studying overlap between scholarly databases and improving metadata quality. The session then focused on two projects: creating an internal data processing environment and developing metadata matching services.</p>
        <p>Alex Bédard-Vallée described the team’s first project: building a data lake to bring together fragmented data from different systems. Previously, data were split across silos like the REST API, internal logs, and production databases. It enables tracking of reference deposits, closing 718M citation gaps. The system already enables analyses that were previously impractical, such as tracking how many members include reference metadata in deposits. It will also power new dashboards, monitoring tools, and other data-driven initiatives that support the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>
        <p><figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/two-flavors.jpg"
        alt="Slide summarizing recent data science work at Crossref, including metadata analysis and matching services." width="75%">
        </figure>
        <br></p>
        <p>Jason Portenoy then outlined the metadata matching project, which links pieces of information (like citations, funder names, or affiliations) to their identifiers such as DOIs or ROR IDs. He gave examples including reference-to-DOI, funder-to-ROR ID, affiliation-to-ROR ID, grant-to-DOI, and preprint-to-published-article matching.</p>
        <p>He explained that much metadata is already deposited by members but large gaps remain. For example, among more than a billion citation links, about 843 million already include DOIs, while another 718 million references can’t yet be matched. The goal is to close these gaps to build a more complete and connected scholarly record—the “research nexus.”</p>

        </figure>
        <h3 id="community-highlights">Community highlights</h3>
        <p>Martyn Rittman, Program Lead, and Kora each opened the community highlights over the two days by noting that everyone presenting is sharing how they use metadata and contribute to the broader ecosystem.</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>Crossref turned twenty-five this year, and our 2025 Annual Meeting became more than a celebration—it was a shared moment to reflect on how far open scholarly infrastructure has come and where we, as a community, are heading next.

Over two days in October, hundreds of participants joined online and in local satellite meetings in Madrid, Nairobi, Medan, Bogotá, Washington D.C., and London––a reminder that our community spans the globe. The meetings offered updates, community highlights, and a look at what’s ahead for our shared metadata network––including plans to connect funders, platforms, and AI tools across the global research ecosystem.

Ed Pentz opened with thanks and perspective. He reflected on how it all began: twelve members, one shared goal — to make research easier to find and verify. 25 years later, the same goal underpins 174 million open metadata records, 1.9 billion citation links, and roughly 1.3 billion DOI resolutions each month. What started as reference linking is now a global network of relationships among people, institutions, and research outputs. Ed also reaffirmed [the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/) as the foundation of our operations and our collaborations with other community-governed infrastructures.

&#62; “Each number represents shared effort, trust, and long-term commitment,” Ed reminded us. “Open infrastructure works because people keep showing up.”

_Crossref’s purpose as per the Certificate of Incorporation._

Following up Ed’s talk, we showed a video timeline, ‘25 years of Crossref’, tracing milestones from the first DOIs to today’s connected Research Nexus.

### Shared perspectives from the community

We featured perspectives from organizations that have built key scholarly infrastructure alongside Crossref over the years. A shared message ran through their talks: open infrastructure only works when it’s interoperable, community-led, and practical for the people who use it.

**[Urooj Nizami (PKP)](https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=ZGOsAXGkryd-LKWy&#38;t=1953)** described PKP and Crossref as “independent and interdependent,” using the archipelago metaphor to show how open software and shared metadata services connect local publishing to a global network.

**[Todd Carpenter (NISO)](https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=wTyUw6m-DBbh9w2D&#38;t=2633)** emphasized standards being a social, and technical contract, noting how persistent identifiers and reliable metadata underpin a broader knowledge graph—and why provenance and linking matter even more as AI systems remix content.

**[Abel Packer (SciELO)](https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=A9EdjLpip3m-2xrF&#38;t=3233)** highlighted Latin America’s strong DOI coverage while pointing out where multilingual versions and preprint–article–data links still break visibility—arguing for metadata that connects versions, not splits them. \[data point\]

**[Soichi Kubota (J-STAGE/JST)](https://youtu.be/0NPqLrPHhYA?si=_lCBwuJ9T0M37q7O&#38;t=2048)** showed how Crossref services (from citation linking, Cited-by, metadata, to Similarity Check) anchor Japan’s national platform and how deeper cooperation (e.g., Crossmark) will support richer, more reliable metadata.

**[Leena Shah (DOAJ)](https://youtu.be/0NPqLrPHhYA?si=wzUIHxHKf2j2J6n0&#38;t=2449)** outlined DOAJ’s open index, renewed POSI commitment, and hands-on collaboration with Crossref—from the MoU and PLACE to help-desk coordination, gap analyses, and plans to boost DOAJ records via Crossref’s API and open references.

**[Susan Murray (AJOL)](https://youtu.be/0NPqLrPHhYA?si=w5w4IolcyaSI_N04&#38;t=2894)** spoke of capacity building: with 900+ journals across 40 countries, benefiting from AJOL’s support in registering identifiers and metadata , and of their long-standing partnership with Crossref making it possible for journals with limited resources to take part.

These voices echoed a common call: Build bridges, not silos.

### Governance and election results

Leading off the formal annual meeting, [Lisa Schiff, Chair of the Crossref Board, looked back on our 25th anniversary](https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=Gcjw0XERzNc45pRQ&#38;t=3826) as one marked by progress and problem-solving. She talked about moving all our systems to the cloud—a big step that makes the organization’s work faster and more reliable. She also spoke about ongoing efforts to maintain the research record’s trustworthiness, including adding Retraction Watch data and updating member terms. Lisa noted new ways we are making membership more accessible, [like the lower $200 tier](https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10) and the expansion of [the GEM program](https://www.crossref.org/gem/).

Lucy Ofiesh brought it back to the role of the members themselves, reminding everyone that success still rests with its members. The annual meeting is when members directly influence Crossref’s direction––when each vote helps shape how we move forward together.

We extend our thanks to the Board members whose terms have concluded, and we congratulate the newly elected members who will carry the work forward.

Five directors were elected: Rebecca Wambua (Distance, Open and e-Learning Practitioners’ Association of Kenya), Damian Bird (CABI), Rose L’Huillier (Elsevier), Anjalie Nawaratne (Springer Nature), and Nick Lindsay (MIT Press).

We also thank the 2025 Nominating Committee for their thoughtful work guiding this year’s process and slate selection.

The Board plays an important role in making sure our governance remains community-led, transparent, and accountable. The volunteer members bring experience from research funders, publishers, and libraries, giving a balance of perspectives that help steer our long-term strategy and sustainability.

### Tools in practice

Then our attention turned to the tools that many members use every day. Patrick Vale walked participants through updates to Participation Reports and the Record Registration Form— designed to make working with metadata simpler.

Updated Participation Report for Universidad La Salle Arequipa (Peru), showing metadata element coverage percentages.

[Participation Reports](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/), first launched in 2018, have now been completely rebuilt as version 1.2. [The refreshed interface](https://doi.org/10.64000/8d5ga-2n897) runs on a new technology stack and supports morecontent types, and offers a new “download gap report” feature that generates a CSV list of records missing key fields—so members can identify and fix gaps directly.

Patrick then demonstrated improvements to the Record Registration Form, now streamlined for creating as well as editing records. The form includes real-time validation, auto-fill options for journals previously used, and the ability to edit existing records directly. Members can now easily add abstracts, funding data, licenses, and affiliations linked to ORCID and ROR—all within one place.

In the final demonstration, Luis Montilla, shared a “short research story”. He showed how anyone can explore Crossref metadata to uncover global participation patterns—turning what might seem like a mass of disconnected records into something meaningful once you start asking questions. He also shared a workflow that automatically retrieves and enriches data with country and regional information, then visualises member contributions and metadata coverage.

Luis also demonstrated an interactive notebook that lets users explore participation trends through radar charts and other visuals—illustrating how open data can help the community understand and improve the completeness of the scholarly record.

### Crossref then &#38; now

Amanda Bartell walked through how the community has changed over 25 years.

![Image of statistics](https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/summary-growth-over-years-2025.png)

The membership has broadened dramatically: universities and scholar-led groups now form the largest share, and more organizations in Asia and Latin America have joined (with big growth in Indonesia and Brazil). Most members are small: 98% qualify for the lowest fee tier, and 57% participate via a Sponsor. In support of including members from smaller economies, Crossref launched a GEM programme, which will be expanding to 19 new countries in 2026.

She expanded her presentation later [with a blog post to share insights about the changes in the Crossref global community](https://doi.org/10.64000/tch5n-9px70).

With our growing membership, the needs of the community are evolving too, including expectations about Crossref’s role in preserving the integrity of the scholarly record.

&#62; “Our role in preserving the integrity of the scholarly record is focused on enriching the metadata to provide fuller and better trust signals while keeping barriers to participation low.” —Amanda Bartell, Crossref

In response to the growing membership across the globe, we launched our Ambassadors program in 2018. Johanssen Obanda highlighted the activities of what is now 50 volunteers across 38 countries. Ambassadors act as local contacts—running training sessions, organizing events, translating materials, and providing feedback from their regions. Over the past year, they’ve led 41 activities reaching around 1,200 people. Many also contribute to GEM outreach, metadata health checks, and regional events—often in local languages.

![Slide titled &#38;quot;Ambassador highlights: supporting GEM program&#38;quot; with left-side collage of conference photos and a world map of Crossref Ambassadors with location pins.](https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/map-ambassadors-2025.png)

### Roadmap highlights

Helena Cousijn outlined progress across three programs—Co-creation and Community Trends, Contributing to the Research Nexus, and Open and Sustainable Operations.
Along with already showcased progress with Participation Reports and the new Record Registration Form, the Community Trends program involves working in partnership with others on DSpace integration and OJS plug-ins consolidation. In the near future there’s also a consideration for piloting AI detection tools.
The Contributing to Research Nexus program carried out a consultation with Metadata Plus subscribers, and develops a new data citations endpoint for the Crossref REST API. This team is also developing further matching services, in the first instance looking to match funder metadata to ROR IDs.

Finally, Helena discussed the recent accomplishment of the Open and Sustainable Operations program, the migration of our database from the data centre to the cloud with Amazon Web Services. Other projects in this program involve ravamping resolution reports, rebuilding the Crossref authentication system, and launching new metadata schema.

### Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability (RCFS)

RCFS program is focused on equity, simplicity, and revenue balance. Kora shared recent developments and next steps:
:
A new $200 membership tier (for organizations with ≤$1,000 in publishing revenue/expenses) takes effect on January 1, 2026; more than 3,000 members have already moved into it.
We will keep “publishing revenue/expenses” as the sizing basis for publishers while funder sizing is still under review.
Volume discounts for content registration end on January 1, 2026.
Backfile discounts for theses/dissertations and conference proceedings are under review.
Peer-review fees are normalized at $0.25 for the first review of a work, with subsequent reviews (same member, same work) for free

### Behind the scenes: metadata, data science

Patricia Feeney reviewed recent and upcoming changes to our metadata schemas. Earlier this year, we began accepting ROR IDs as funder identifiers and released schema 5.4, which added versioning across all record types, a new status field for preprints, and a way to label citation types (like data sets, software, or blog posts).

Coming soon, Crossref will add grant DOIs to funding metadata and release schema 5.5, which supports the CRediT contributor vocabulary and allows multiple contributor roles. A new grant schema will follow, including support for beneficiaries, project identifiers (like RAiD), and repeatable roles. Looking ahead to 2026, our plans to overhaul how names and organizations are modeled, add richer funding and data-availability statements, and expand abstract and multilingual metadata support. A new Metadata Advisory Group has also been formed to guide work on multilingual fields, subjects, keywords, and relationship modeling.

![Slide explaining that ROR can be supplied as a funder identifier, and listing updates to the Grants schema and schema 5.4.](https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/ror-grant-schema.png)

Finally, Patricia announced [plans to deprecate older schemas](https://doi.org/10.64000/zppnw-1se30)—a gradual, multi-year process—to simplify and modernize our metadata structure. She highlighted the importance of stronger relationships, richer records, and practical improvements that make metadata more useful across the community. That focus on connection carried directly into the next session about building through data science.

### Data science at Crossref

Dominika Tkaczyk introduced the new data science team, formed a few months ago as part of the technology group. The team was created because of the growing scale and complexity of the data Crossref manages, driven by the expanding scholarly community. Their role is to use data science to assess, improve, and enrich scholarly metadata.

Their work falls into two areas: data analysis and insights—to help Crossref understand the scholarly record and guide decisions—and data services and workflows—to apply data science in building and maintaining production systems. Examples include studying overlap between scholarly databases and improving metadata quality. The session then focused on two projects: creating an internal data processing environment and developing metadata matching services.

Alex Bédard-Vallée described the team’s first project: building a data lake to bring together fragmented data from different systems. Previously, data were split across silos like the REST API, internal logs, and production databases. It enables tracking of reference deposits, closing 718M citation gaps. The system already enables analyses that were previously impractical, such as tracking how many members include reference metadata in deposits. It will also power new dashboards, monitoring tools, and other data-driven initiatives that support the integrity of the scholarly record.

![Slide summarizing recent data science work at Crossref, including metadata analysis and matching services.](https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/two-flavors.jpg)

Jason Portenoy then outlined the metadata matching project, which links pieces of information (like citations, funder names, or affiliations) to their identifiers such as DOIs or ROR IDs. He gave examples including reference-to-DOI, funder-to-ROR ID, affiliation-to-ROR ID, grant-to-DOI, and preprint-to-published-article matching.

He explained that much metadata is already deposited by members but large gaps remain. For example, among more than a billion citation links, about 843 million already include DOIs, while another 718 million references can’t yet be matched. The goal is to close these gaps to build a more complete and connected scholarly record—the “research nexus.”

![Two “Matching — Why bother?” slides with pie charts showing gaps in DOI and ROR ID metadata. Each chart highlights deposited IDs, automatically matchable items, and items with no identifier. Crossref 25th logo included.](https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2025/matching-why-bother.png)

### Community highlights

Martyn Rittman, Program Lead, and Kora each opened the community highlights over the two days by noting that everyone presenting is sharing how they use metadata and contribute to the broader ecosystem.

&#62; Crossref does not exist without our members and the broader community—people who provide metadata and people who use the metadata. That’s why we’re here.” ~ Martyn Rittman

**[Antoine Drouin (Fonds de Recherche du Québec)](https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=m_bOdQ0UrDekhHCd&#38;t=8158)** shared that FRQ joined Crossref earlier this year and created 22,000+ grant and scholarship DOIs, linking grants to outputs and improving interoperability with ORCID, ROR, and Crossref grant IDs.

**[Agon Memeti (University of Tetova)](https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=l9euyQIB8tcIrDR5&#38;t=8928)** shared findings of his analysis of abstract metadata coverage across 2024 articles from 13 university journals.

**[Charlie Rapple (Kudos)](https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=AQ0Y6pDEUY2saoj3&#38;t=9528)** presented a Crossref-supported study on how researchers engage with the UN SDGs and described Kudos’ work explaining research for wider audiences. A survey of ~4,500 researchers showed strong awareness, regional differences in SDG priorities, and some targeted budgets for promotion, alongside challenges in publishing SDG-focused local research in prestige venues.

**[Pia Kretschmar (SCOAP3)](https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=fg9M2VzEzeZtyUc&#38;t=10264)** outlined integrating Crossref metadata into new SCOAP³ open science elements in Phase 4; SCOAP³ funds OA publishing in high-energy physics and has covered 78,000+ articles. Publishers are scored on elements such as metadata provision to Crossref, identifiers, and links to datasets/software; completeness was checked via the Crossref API, results varied, and evaluation continues next year.

**[Barbara Rivera (Barcelona Declaration)](https://youtu.be/csDj_YkNuG8?si=fBmVBqAXG0Uy0ULr&#38;t=10923)** introduced the Declaration, its four commitments, and its community of 125 signatories and 52 supporters, including Crossref. Working groups are executing a joint roadmap, with recent actions such as a funding-metadata roundtable and upcoming surveys on metadata frameworks and repository workflows.

**[Hans de Jonge (Dutch Research Council, NWO)](https://youtu.be/0NPqLrPHhYA?si=WybCBaSxzh-Wnoa3&#38;t=7753)** presented his and Bianca Kramer’s [recent study (as of 10/23/25 Preprint, not yet reviewed)](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/ndx3f_v1) of metadata completeness in Crossref among publishers using different manuscript submission systems. They compared six metadata types across major publishers and found that differences had more to do with workflow choices, customization, and policy than with the system itself.

**[Audrey Kenni (Pan African Medical Journal)](https://youtu.be/0NPqLrPHhYA?si=DIs2W6wIgUHHYy2h&#38;t=8350)** shared PAMJ’s journey with Crossref to increased visibility.

**[Nurul Ain Mohd Noor (UMT Press, Malaysia)](https://youtu.be/0NPqLrPHhYA?si=8LT4O1xOYA9W1Hva&#38;t=8721)** described UMT Press’s evolution since 2003, rebranding in 2007 and joining Crossref in 2020. Nurul explained how registering their metadata with Crossref increased citation visibility and indexing across databases.

**[Achal Agrawal (PostPub)](https://youtu.be/0NPqLrPHhYA?si=BzmyKx8i0g4SYjPl&#38;t=9123)** introduced PostPub’s dashboard providing retraction statistics by country and institution, supported by a Catalyst Grant from Digital Science, and shared their journey through disambiguation challenges.

**[Ratna Galuh Manika Trisista (Universitas Islam Jakarta)](https://youtu.be/0NPqLrPHhYA?si=sOPvYU5VV5p_bL5H&#38;t=9641)** presented how enabling reference linking transformed her law journal’s citation visibility.

### Closing reflections

We closed the meeting with a panel discussion on the **Research Nexus in the real world**: What is the impact and potential of open scholarly metadata. Ginny Hendricks, Crossref; Dominika Tkaczyk, Crossref; Bianca Kramer, Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information; David Oliva Uribe, UNESCO; Amber Osman, XploreOpen; Mariángela Nápoli, CONICET-IICE UBA-FFYL; Crossref; Kazuhiro Hayashi, National Institute of Science and Technology Policy; Science Council of Japan, shared a diversity of perspectives, which we’ll share in an upcoming blog.

      <title>Wellcome and Europe PMC: supporting Open Research through open metadata</title>
      <link>https://www.crossref.org/blog/wellcome-and-europe-pmc-supporting-open-research-through-open-metadata/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In my latest conversations with research funders, I talked with Hannah Hope, Open Research Lead at Wellcome, and Melissa Harrison, Team Leader of Literature Services at Europe PMC. Wellcome and Europe PMC are working together to realise the potential of funding metadata and the Crossref Grant Linking System for, among other things, programmatic grantee reporting. In this blog, we explore how this partnership works and how the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/wellcome-explains-the-benefits-of-developing-an-open-and-global-grant-identifier/" target="_blank">Crossref Grant Linking System is supporting Wellcome</a> in realising their Open Science vision.</p>
        <h3 id="what-motivated-you-to-join-crossref">What motivated you to join Crossref?</h3>
        <p>Hannah: The motivation for Crossref Grant IDs is to be able to disaggregate research outputs between funders. Funders’ grant identifiers come in a range of formats, funders might change them over time, and there are also similarities between funders’ names, which is a challenge. Permanent identifiers, in this case, Crossref Grant IDs, are an opportunity to avoid some of the confusion if we were able to implement them throughout the research ecosystem.</p>
        <p>This is also being discussed in different contexts, for example, within the Barcelona Declaration working groups, <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/news/20251023_community_roundtable/" target="_blank">funders and other stakeholders</a> are exploring the diverse motivations that exist to implement changes into our workflows, as well as the challenges that funding metadata and persistent grant IDs can help solve.</p>
        <h3 id="the-way-wellcome-implemented-the-grant-linking-system-is-a-bit-unique-given-that-it-partnered-with-europe-pmc-for-the-technical-implementation-and-metadata-registration-with-crossref-can-you-tell-us-more-about-how-it-works">The way Wellcome implemented the Grant Linking System is a bit unique, given that it partnered with Europe PMC for the technical implementation and metadata registration with Crossref. Can you tell us more about how it works?</h3>
        <p>Hannah: The collaboration between Wellcome and Europe PMC in the implementation of Crossref’s Grant Linking System started because they already had the grants <a href="https://europepmc.org/grantfinder/grantdetails?query=pi%3A%22%7BDr%7D%7BFritz%7D%7BZoe%7D%7BZ%7D%22%20gid%3A%22208213%22%20ga%3A%22Wellcome%20Trust%22" target="_blank">landing page feature</a> ready and available to us.</p>
        <p>There was an initial hope that other funders of Europe PMC, which also have these grant landing pages, could then leverage that same system to make Crossref grant IDs more broadly available to the research community, but I am not sure if that has materialised yet.</p>
        <p>Melissa: Currently we are supporting Wellcome’s implementation of Crossref grant IDs, but the infrastructure remains available to other Europe PMC funders should they decide to take advantage of it. We already have funding metadata for Europe PMC funders because it is a requirement for grantees to select their grant identifier when submitting their accepted manuscripts for indexing and archiving. As we already have that metadata, naturally we can pull it together and send it to Crossref, along with the link to the Europe PMC grant landing pages!</p>
        <p>An additional benefit of partnering with Europe PMC is the comprehensive metadata we deliver to Crossref with the grant IDs. For example, we have invested in supplementing affiliation data with ROR iDs and we deliver to Crossref all the data we have that matches their schema for grant data.</p>
        <h3 id="how-is-wellcome-leveraging-the-funding-metadata-and-crossref-grants-ids-that-are-being-shared-and-registered-with-crossref">How is Wellcome leveraging the funding metadata and Crossref grants IDs that are being shared and registered with Crossref?</h3>
        <p>Hannah: We are discussing internally how we can better socialise the Crossref grant DOIs among the grantees, either via our grant management system or through Europe PMC. One place where the Crossref grant DOIs are being used and shared is through our publishing platform, <a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/" target="_blank">Wellcome Open Research</a>. The Crossref grant DOI is included in the publication metadata, ensuring that the research output is linked to the funding via the open metadata registered.</p>
        <p>However, as we use Europe PMC as our repository for funded written research outputs, these outputs are aggregated alongside the grant records which includes the Crossref grant DOI, facilitated by Europe PMC APIs. So we have the means to link the two things together.</p>
        <p>Melissa: There are some UX and technical blockers to fully integrate Crossref grant IDs within the Europe PMC grant system currently that are detrimental to the utility of these IDs, for example, you can’t search for a specific grant in <a href="https://europepmc.org/grantfinder" target="_blank">Europe PMC grant finder</a> using a Crossref grant ID. We are partnering with Crossref to solve these challenges and offer users more functionality in this space next year.</p>
        <p>Hannah: Beyond eLife and Wellcome Open Research, I am not sure which publishers use Crossref grants DOIs in their workflows.</p>
        <p>Rocio: That’s an interesting question, as we aren’t seeing a massive flow of Crossref grant IDs in the works metadata records just yet. We are exploring with publishers and their service providers how to make this business-as-usual, and in the meantime, we are running a series of matching projects to ensure that, when possible, we <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/piecing-together-the-research-nexus-uncovering-relationships-with-open-funding-metadata/" target="_blank">make those connections ourselves to enrich the metadata with funding information</a>. We already insert reciprocal relationships where one record asserts a link with another (in this case, where either a grant <code>Finances</code> a work or a work <code>isFinancedBy</code> a grant record, Crossref adds in the reverse). Improving and enriching these relationships directly in the metadata makes sure that metadata provided by funders can make their way to the research outputs that originate from the grant.</p>
        <h3 id="wellcome-is-streamlining-the-way-of-asking-grantees-to-report-on-their-publications-facilitated-by-europe-pmc-can-you-tell-us-a-bit-more-about-how-this-will-work-and-what-role-metadata-will-play">Wellcome is streamlining the way of asking grantees to report on their publications, facilitated by Europe PMC. Can you tell us a bit more about how this will work and what role metadata will play?</h3>
        <p>Hannah: We will stop asking researchers to report their publications directly to us as part of progress and end-of-grant reporting. We believe there is sufficient open metadata with high-quality tagging in the ecosystem for us to collect written research outputs programmatically from this public data. Under our new system, we will be directing researchers to look at their grant record within Europe PMC and make sure that their written research outputs are properly linked there; otherwise, we won’t see them. We are trying to leverage open data, existing infrastructure, and a route that enables us to improve the completeness of open metadata.</p>
        <p>There aren’t many mechanisms that enable our researchers to add assertions to funding and research output records retrospectively, and Europe PMC offers us that opportunity, and that is really critical for us. Rather than collecting information in our own system, we can contribute to enhancing the global corpus of knowledge and the quality of open metadata more broadly. Since correcting metadata at source isn’t easy, Europe PMC presents us with an opportunity to contribute to that system.</p>
        <p>Melissa: We are thinking broadly about this problem; many institutions curate their research information in spreadsheets or closed CRIS systems and struggle to make it publicly available. We are thinking about how Europe PMC can be leveraged to be a public home for that data. EMBL-EBI hosts Europe PMC and utilises it as the institutional repository, so we have started a pilot project to add ROR IDs for affiliations to EMBL-authored publications within Europe PMC. This is manually curated, high-quality metadata that would otherwise be lost from the public ecosystem.</p>
        <h3 id="if-you-look-into-the-future-what-would-your-hopes-be-for-the-gls-and-greater-transparency-in-funding-metadata-in-general-what-do-you-think-that-we-could-achieve-collectively-as-a-community">If you look into the future, what would your hopes be for the GLS and greater transparency in funding metadata in general? What do you think that we could achieve collectively as a community?</h3>
        <p>Melissa: It would be amazing (!) if everybody, from funders to publishers, to institutions and authors, would coalesce around the Crossref Grant Linking System, and add to metadata exchange workflows – you would potentially have a very clean and clear picture of where the money is going, what the outputs are, and how they relate.</p>
        <p>Currently, even with the Open Funder Registry, there is ambiguity around funder names - for example, different geographical national funders sharing the same exact name as their counterpart in another country - so even with the best will in the world, funder institutions could be misidentified in systems and assigned the wrong identifier. The Crossref Grant Linking System facilitates complete disambiguation because grants are associated with the issuing funder’s correct identifier, ensuring traceability of outputs and funding and enabling more precise, cleaner metadata.</p>
        <p>Hannah: I think that is a bit of the Holy Grail and in reality, its a bit messy, there isn’t just one system! We need to be able to move past the chicken and egg discussion, where we talk about the use of different identifiers, with sometimes competing priorities. For me, the real challenge for the metadata community is how do we enrich metadata, correct errors, and develop greater interoperability between PID systems. So that multiple parties can contribute towards the creation of a greater whole record, rather than relying on a single owner of the record to provide all the information. If we could all, funders included, connect information from individual partners to create a unified record at the end of it, we could have better records and probably save time by distributing the workload.</p>
        <h3 id="what-would-you-say-to-colleagues-in-other-funders-about-investing-in-open-metadata">What would you say to colleagues in other funders about investing in open metadata?</h3>
        <p>We all need information from other partners in the ecosystem and investing in our own internal system <strong>will not give us the same return as collectively investing in opening up that information</strong> wherever possible.</p>
        <p>—&mdash;-</p>
        <p>We are very grateful to Hannah Hope and Melissa Harrison for their perspectives on open funding metadata and the role of the community in ensuring a complete and comprehensive Research Nexus.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In January 2026, our new annual membership fee tier takes effect. The new tier is US$200 for member organisations that operate on publishing revenue or expenses (whichever is higher) of up to US$1,000 annually. We <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/cvvj8-tax10" target="_blank">announced the Board’s decision</a>, making it possible in July, and––as you can infer from <a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/tch5n-9px70" target="_blank">Amanda’s latest blog</a>––this is the first such change to the annual membership fee tiers in close to 20 years!</p>
        <p>The new fee tier resulted from the consultation process and fees review undertaken as part of the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability program</a>, carried out with the help of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/">Membership and Fees Committee</a> (made up of representatives from member organisations and community partners). The program is ongoing, and the new fee tier, intended to make Crossref membership more accessible, is one of the first changes it helped us determine.</p>
        <p>When our membership renewal invoices are sent out in January 2026, the new fee tier will apply to 3,194 of our existing members, who will receive annual membership invoices 27% lower than previously. Surveys preceding the introduction of the new fee tier have shown that it might be applicable to between 30-60% of the organisations in what used to be our lowest fee tier (US$275 fee for organisations with publishing revenue or expenses of up to US$1 million).</p>
        <p>We received positive feedback from members affected by the change.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We are very grateful for the new lowest membership fee tier. The Crossref fee is indeed a significant expense for our organisation, but we accept it given its importance. This new fee structure will make it easier for us to cover the cost.” – said Marina Pérez, Análisis Filosófico.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>This initiative by Crossref to reduce membership fees is a welcome step toward achieving a truly global and connected research ecosystem. This will undoubtedly help our journal&rsquo;s mission in fostering inclusive, open, and accessible publishing.” – said Dev Roychowdhury, Journal of Psychological Experience.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Following the feedback provided in the consultations and a number of prompts over the months after the original announcement, our Membership Team gathered information necessary to transition 3,194 members into the new fee tier. That’s 14.5% of all Crossref members (please note that in the graph below the number of members in $200 tier is higher due to recent influx of new members who didn&rsquo;t need to transition, further – &ldquo;$0&rdquo; denotes all our sponsored members, who don’t pay membership fees to us, and those included in the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">GEM program</a>).</p>

        alt="pie chart showing proportion of Crossref members on each membership fee tier" width="75%">
        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>Any members out there who think their organisation should be moved to the new lowest membership fee tier and haven’t already informed us – please contact us as soon as possible, before the end of the year, so we can make the change before invoices are raised in January.</p>
        <p>We know – from speaking with our community (and thank you SO MUCH, for everyone’s feedback in surveys and discussions!) that this change makes participation in Crossref more accessible to smaller organisations communicating research. This will result in a continued flow of new records and associated metadata into the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/" target="_blank">research nexus</a>, helping us to make it easier to find and assess research, achieve greater transparency in the scientific process, and continue building trust in its outputs.</p>
        <p>We’re not done reviewing our fees, and we don’t think the new fee tier addresses all the needs of the growing and evolving scholarly community. We continue working with Sponsors and Ambassadors, and we have upcoming changes to the Global Equitable Membership program to facilitate participation by all types and sizes of organisations sharing research.</p>]]>
