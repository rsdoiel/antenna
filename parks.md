## Grand Canyon National Park to Temporarily Close Overnight Hotel Accommodations Beginning August 29

date: 2024-08-28, from: Press Releases

Grand Canyon National Park will implement Stage 4 water restrictions on the South Rim starting the afternoon of Thursday, August 29, due to a series of four significant breaks in the 12½ mile-long Transcanyon Waterline that supplies water from the canyon for use in the park. Since July 8, the park has faced challenges with water supply, and currently, no water is being pumped to either the South or North Rim. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/temporary-closure-of-hotel-accomodations.htm

<p>BARSTOW, CA. – <a name="_Hlk160197126">The Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comment on a proposed land sale of approximately 30 acres of public lands located in San Bernardino County to </a><a name="_Hlk160562469">Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway</a>. The <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-19256.pdf">Notice of Realty Action</a> will publish in the Federal Register on Wednesday, August 28, to begin a public comment period that will close Oct. 15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway has proposed to use the land for the <a href="https://bnsfbig.com/">Barstow International Gateway</a> project, an approximately 4,500-acre integrated rail facility that would transfer goods from international to domestic containers. The proposed project would result in a more than $1.5 billion investment in the community, potentially creating more than 20,000 new jobs and helping to address logistics and supply chain issues. If approved, the Barstow International Gateway project is expected to also help reduce freeway congestion around the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.</p>

<p>The public land proposed for sale is suitable for private sale since it is surrounded by private lands and provides no public access. As such, there would be no impacts to public land access or recreation. If approved, the public lands would be sold to Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway at fair market value.</p>

<p>Anyone interested reviewing the environmental assessment, the appraisal, or maps, may visit the <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2033900/510">BLM National NEPA Register</a>, or visit the BLM Barstow Field Office, 2601 Barstow Road in Barstow, CA 92311, during business hours 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., five days a week, excluding federal holidays. The public may contact the office at 760-252-6000 to make visitation arrangements.</p>

<p>Written comments should be sent to Bureau of Land Management, Barstow Field Office, ATTN: Tim McCain, 2601 Barstow Road in Barstow, CA 92311, or sent by email to tmccain@blm.gov.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For additional information, contact Tim McCain, Realty Specialist, at <a href="mailto:tmccain@blm.gov">tmccain@blm.gov</a>.</p>
