On Sept. 13, Grand Canyon wildlife managers successfully relocated 100 bison from the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. All bison were transferred to the Intertribal Buffalo Council, which transported them to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota.

Since reduction efforts began in 2018, park staff have removed 306 bison from the North Rim, with 282 transferred to eight different American Indian tribes through an agreement with the Intertribal Buffalo Council. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/100-bison-transferred-from-north-rim-2024.htm
