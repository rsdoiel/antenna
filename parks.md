## Grand Canyon South Rim Reimplements Water Conservation Measures

date: 2024-08-04, from: Press Releases

Effective immediately, Grand Canyon National Park will reimplement mandatory water conservation measures for the South Rim of the park. These water restrictions are in response to a pump failure at Havasupai Gardens.

Water conservation measures require all park residents and visitors to conserve and reduce water usage wherever possible in homes, hotel rooms and campgrounds. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/water-conservation-measures-reimplemented-south-rim.htm
