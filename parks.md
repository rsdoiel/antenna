## Repairing the Ikpikpuk River Gage

date: 2024-01-03, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>Repairing the Ikpikpuk River Gage</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p paraeid="{7615ef32-c3fa-4060-8e4d-dbccba4fab36}{9}" paraid="1155231820">In February 2023 the Ikpikpuk River gage stopped streaming quality data, indicating an issue with the pressure transducers (i.e., water level sensors). As Bureau of Land Management (BLM) staff considered whether to fix the gage or decommission it, members of the Utqiagvik community contacted the office inquiring about the status of the gage. They told the BLM how valuable the river data was to their community. The gage is monitored by the public to assess the travel conditions along the river and has been a handy tool to watch for potential flooding events that would affect subsistence camps and cabins downstream of the gage site. The data is especially useful during river breakup and freeze up.  </p>

<p paraeid="{577b156c-8d0c-47df-ba9a-a665d6e76d55}{212}" paraid="1260451055">The BLM Arctic District Office manages about 187 river miles of the Ikpikpuk River within the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A). The Ikpikpuk River flows north from its headwaters in the foothills of the Brooks Range to the Beaufort Sea. BLM established a river gage on the Ikpikpuk River below Frye Creek in 2002 that is accessible by helicopter from Umiat or Inigok field stations. The gage is about 70 miles from the Umiat Field Station and 40 miles from Inigok Field Station. </p>

It’s logistically challenging to manage due to its location, so site visits occur opportunistically between late May and early September when other aquatic monitoring is being done within the NPR-A.</p>

            <div class="field contact-block -media-image">  <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/styles/bio_photo/public/images/2024-01/20230629%20Ikpikpuk%20Logger%20Box.jpg?itok=jzBIqcr4" width="640" height="480" alt="The Ikpikpuk River gage is on the west bank of the river." typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>

<figcaption>The Ikpikpuk River gage is on the west bank of the river. At the top of the bank, there are meteorological sensors and a data logger box. A cable runs from the data logger box to a conduit box, located lower on the bank closer to the water’s edge. From the conduit box, cables extend to pressure transducers (PTs) situated in the river to record water depth.</figcaption></figure><p paraeid="{78d2545c-2ef2-4c81-b63d-952d14646403}{97}" paraid="1866066542">We went to the Ikpikpuk River gage in early June for an initial assessment of the issue with the river gage. While patches of snow lingered on the riverbanks, the river was ice-free and the early flowers of the season, Anemone parviflora, were in bloom. A portion of the bank above the conduit box had slid since last summer, burying the PTs and associated cables with sediment. We took an inventory of things needed to fix the gage and planned our trip back.   </p>

<p paraeid="{78d2545c-2ef2-4c81-b63d-952d14646403}{163}" paraid="1100428544">We returned when the riverbank was covered with green foliage and a variety of wildflowers with two new PTs and cable. We deployed the new equipment, protecting the PTs with piping and the cables with conduit and waited to confirm that data was being transmitting correctly. Typically, the PT should be placed low enough in the river that it is able to capture all flow regimes and, if possible, utilize features of the riverbed to stay in place. However, due to high water on the day of our visit, we were not able to situate the PTs in this ideal way and instead positioned them to the best of our ability from the shore. </p>

We could see that the PTs had come out of the water at various times of lower water level. Given that we had one final field visit planned, there was still time to make further adjustments before winter set in. </p>

<p paraeid="{6a0bd124-a95b-456e-979e-af9527e50c36}{49}" paraid="724949401">On August 29th, we visited the Ikpikpuk River gage for the last time of the field season. The leaves had already turned towards autumn. The river was even higher than it had been on our last visit. Still, we were able to resituate the PTs a little deeper into the river so that they would be less likely to come out of water. We hand surveyed the water level using previously established elevation benchmarks and applied appropriate offsets to the water level readings from the PTs so that water level reported online is comparable with that of the historical record. Additionally, we installed a new wind sensor.  </p>

We immediately heard back that people had already noticed the updates to the reported data online and had been reviewing the gage data regularly on their hunting trip. </p>
