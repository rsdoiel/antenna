## Grand Canyon South Rim Implements Water Conservation Measures

date: 2025-08-05, from: Press Releases

Effective immediately, Grand Canyon National Park will implement water conservation measures for the South Rim of the park. These water restrictions are in response to a broken section of pipeline north of Phantom Ranch. Water conservation measures require all park residents and visitors to conserve and reduce water usage wherever possible in homes, hotel rooms and campgrounds. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/water-restrictions-south-rim-august-2025.htm
