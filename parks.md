Male sage-grouse are most vulnerable <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-03-31/sage-grouse-springtime-lands-thousand-dances">on the lek</a>, but females are most at-risk on the nest, where their single focus is bringing their eggs safely to hatch.

<p><br>
Female sage-grouse lay 6 to 8 eggs, one per day, in ground-level nests. Sometimes, a hen will build this year's nest within a few feet of where she had success the previous year but always under the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-05-12/sagebrush-and-grasses-and-forbs-all-better-nesting">best available cover of sagebrush and native grasses</a> that have begun to appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 4 weeks, a hen will leave her nest only once or twice a day, typically at the same time each day, to eat and relieve herself. Males also return to denser cover by the end of May to rest and find food, but they play no part in nest-tending. Their work is done until next spring's breeding season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hens will continue to take shelter and lead their surviving chicks to find food in this type of vegetation in the weeks that follow hatching.&nbsp;</p>
