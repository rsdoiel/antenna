## Ripple Effect: Dillon Field Office Partners Help Riparian Areas Thrive

<p>The Southwest Montana Sagebrush Partnership (SMSP) and the Youth Employment Program (YEP) have been hard at work this summer installing Beaver Dam Analogs (BDAs) on BLM-administered lands in southwestern Montana.</p>

<p>BDAs are handmade structures that mimic beaver dams. They hold back water and cause it to spread across the landscape. This process creates larger wetland areas which in turn increases willows and other riparian area plant species.</p>

<p>Riparian areas are critically important for diverse wildlife habitat and forage. By expanding riparian areas and holding more water on the landscape, these riparian areas continue to thrive and help the BLM fulfill its multiple use mission.</p>

<p>So far this summer, SMSP and YEP have maintained close to 70 BDA structures and built 60 new ones. YEP crews are comprised of mostly high school-aged youth and some college-aged employees. The youthful enthusiasm of the crews makes for a very fun and productive environment. They are very important to the Dillon Field Office and get a lot of work accomplished on BLM and adjacent lands.</p>

## Grand Canyon Implements Water Conservation Measures

date: 2024-07-15, from: Press Releases

Effective immediately, Grand Canyon National Park will implement mandatory water conservation measures for the South Rim of the park. These water restrictions are in response to a failure in the Trans Canyon Waterline after it was shut off for repairs. Crews were trying to repressurize the line when there was a break, causing an extension of the current water outage. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/news-release.htm
