<p>FERNDALE, Calif. –  The Bureau of Land Management will offer two yearling fillies and four wild burros for adoption Saturday, March 9, at the Humboldt County Fairgrounds in Ferndale. </p>

<p>Anyone interested can see the available animals between noon and 5 p.m., Friday, March 8.  The adoption begins with a silent auction at 9 a.m. Saturday.  Animals not taken during the auction will be available on a first come, first served basis for a $125 adoption fee.  The BLM’s Adoption Incentive Program applies to this event; adopters receive a check for $1,000, when they receive title to their animals a year after adoption.</p>

<p>To qualify, adopters must be at least 18 years old and have facilities that meet the BLM’s requirements. Title to the animals remains with the federal government for a year, after which adopters can apply for title. Detailed information about adopter qualifications and facility requirements can be found <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/wild-horse-and-burro/adoptions-and-sales">online</a>.</p>

<p>The adoption event is being held in conjunction with the Back Country Horsemen of California Trail Obstacle Challenge, a free event for spectators. The event includes demonstrations on back country horse and burro packing topics, including Dutch oven cooking, predator encounters, trail etiquette and correctly packing gear.</p>

<p>The BLM is responsible under the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/programs_wildhorse_history_doc1.pdf">Wild Free Roaming Horses and Burro Act</a> for protecting and managing wild horses and burros on public lands. The agency periodically removes animals from the range when populations exceed levels established to allow wild horse and burro herds to thrive in balance with other range users, including wildlife and permitted livestock. These animals are then available for adoption at events throughout the country.</p>

<p>NEEDLES, Calif. – The Bureau of Land Management California Desert District welcomes Ron Nuckles as the new field manager for the Needles Field Office. In his role, Nuckles will oversee the management of more than 3.2 million acres of public lands in San Bernardino County. Nuckles started his position today and succeeds Michael Ahrens, who retired in December 2023.</p>

<p>“Ron brings a deep understanding of the BLM’s mission and programs and has experience working with others through challenging issues,” said Shelly Lynch, California Desert District Manager. “We are fortunate to have a field manager who is originally from the area and is familiar with the local communities and landscapes.”</p>

<p>Nuckles started his career with the BLM in 2017, where he managed engineering, maintenance, and support services for the Vale District Office in Oregon. He most recently spent two years as the Assistant Field Manager for the Lake Havasu Field Office in Arizona, managing operations for one of the only lake systems in the BLM, commercial leasing, recreation events, and Tribal relations. Nuckles served in the U.S. Marine Corps and has more than 20 years of federal experience, including eight years at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, and five years with the National Park Service at Joshua Tree National Park and Shenandoah National Park.</p>

<p>“I’m eager to be back in California working with staff, partners, and communities to accomplish the goals of the agency using innovative solutions,” said Nuckles. “I have extensive experience working with various agencies across multiple jurisdictions and understand how to balance stakeholder and community wants and needs, while achieving the BLM’s multiple-use mission.”</p>

<p>Nuckles was born and raised in southern California where he has spent most of his life. In his personal time, Ron enjoys recreating on public lands and waterways with his wife and three kids.</p>

<p>The Needles Field Office manages the eastern most portion of the California Desert Conservation Area which includes a large portion of the 1.6-million-acre Mojave Trails National Monument. The Monument is home to Amboy Crater National Natural Landmark, Afton Canyon Natural Area, Sheephole Valley Wilderness, and encampments of General George S. Patton Jr. The California Historic Route 66 National Scenic Byway also runs through the field office.

## BLM donates water tender to Cedarville Volunteer Fire Department

date: 2024-02-27, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>BLM donates water tender to Cedarville Volunteer Fire Department</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p>The Bureau of Land Management has donated a firefighting water tender to the Cedarville Volunteer Fire Department, increasing the capability of the department that often assists the BLM with wildfires near northeast California communities.</p>

<p>The 1997 diesel powered tender has a 3,000-gallon water tank and is designed to draft water from a source such as a pond, stream or hydrant and haul it to fire engines working on the fireline. This vehicle is ruggedly built and can handle travel to and from wildland fire incidents.</p>

<div data-embed-button="embed_image" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.wysiwyg_embed" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4fe2e67f-1fa7-4ec1-88ef-e2c75ab20b12" data-langcode="en" class="align-center embedded-entity" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]"><div>
  
  




  

            <div class="field contact-block -media-image">  <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/styles/bio_photo/public/images/2024-02/53532628772_d991e1acf0_c.jpg?itok=SAUGNYTD" width="640" height="458" alt="Two men review a document while standing in front of a water truck." typeof="foaf:Image">

</div>


<p> </p>

<p>“We are happy to donate this engine to the Cedarville Fire Department,” said John Toomey, fire management officer for the BLM Applegate Field Office. “This unit has served the BLM well, and still has plenty of service life left.”</p>

<p>Cedarville Fire Chief Jim Hill said the unit will replace an older water tender. It will support the department’s wildland fire engine and two engines designed for fighting structure fires.</p>

<p>The water tender was provided to the volunteer department under the BLM’s <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/public-safety-and-fire/rural-fire-readiness-program">Rural Fire Readiness Program</a>, which provides equipment to qualifying fire departments that cooperate with the BLM and assist fighting fires on public lands. In the program, local departments apply to receive BLM fire fighting equipment declared surplus when the BLM purchases new equipment.</p>

<p>The water tender went into service in 1997 with the Bakersfield Field Office, where it was steadily utilized until it was replaced about two years ago. Before transferring the truck to the local department, the BLM arranged for inspections and repairs so that it arrived in Cedarville ready for service.</p>

<p>The donation was the fourth in recent years in northeast California. In addition to the water tender donation to Cedarville, the BLM has donated wildland fire engines to the Standish-Litchfield, Milford and Fort Bidwell volunteer fire departments.</p>

## BLM Arizona Project Manager Alexia Williams makes a difference on public lands

<p style="margin-bottom: 11px;"><em>During Black History Month, we are highlighting outstanding employees who make a difference at the Bureau of Land Management Arizona and beyond. These employees, such as Alexia Williams, strengthen our mission to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.</em></p>

<p><em>“For me, Black History Month means celebrating the accomplishments of the Black Americans that came before us, and those who continue to break barriers, persist, and excel despite the obstacles,” Williams said.</em></p>

<div>
<p><em>From Wyoming to California to Arizona, Williams makes a difference in her stewardship of America's public lands and resources.</em></p>

<p>The sun rises against the Imperial Sand Dunes in El Centro, California.</p>

<p>The early mornings – with 5 and 6 a.m. start times – bring a small crew closer together. The group is scouring survey plots for purple flowers, Peirson's milkvetch, which are popping up across the sand. Peirson's milkvetch, a California endangered plant species, is a flower that is endemic to southern Arizona and northern Mexico.</p>

<p>Among them, Alexia Williams.</p>

<p>At BLM California, Williams, who was an outdoor recreation planner, was driven by a love of public lands to help wherever she could, even in areas beyond her title.</p>

<p>Williams was an outdoor recreation planner for seven years at BLM California’s El Centro Field Office, from 2016 to 2023. “When I was thinking about my career and where it was going, I wanted to seek out more project management opportunities,” she said.</p>

<p>That led her back to Tucson, where she also earned her Bachelor of Science in ecology and evolutionary biology, along with a minor in conservation biology, from the University of Arizona in 2014.</p>

<p>“Back when I graduated college, I actually did not know what the BLM was. But an internship opportunity came up, and I didn't know what I was going to do,” she said. “It was an awesome opportunity for all of us who applied.” That summer after graduating she was an outdoor recreation planner at the BLM Kemmerer Field Office through the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/careers/students-and-grads/direct-hire-program">DHA-RAI program</a>.</p>

<p>“After two years, I decided Wyoming was a little too cold, and my parents lived in Yuma, Arizona, after military service,” she said. El Centro is only about an hour away from Yuma.</p>

<p>“When I was in El Centro, I did a lot of visitor contacts out in the Imperial Sand Dunes and a couple of other open OHV areas, and I got the question a lot about how to get into the federal government. It came up more times than I can count,” she said. “I explained to everyone that I had gotten in through an internship, but there are a variety of ways to get into public service.”</p>

<p>“My advice for those interested in working in the federal government is to keep an open mind,” Williams said. At the BLM, there are a variety of ways to get into federal service, including through an internship like Williams did. “Many of us started as seasonal employees, interns, contractors, etc., and typically even volunteer experience counts towards the qualifications.”</p>

<p>After her own stints at BLM Wyoming and BLM California, Williams is now a project manager focused on Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act-funded projects in the Bureau of Land Management Arizona’s Gila District.</p>

<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act funds about 50 projects in the Gila District on BLM-managed public lands. These projects would not be successful without the passion and hard work of project managers like Williams.</p>

</div>

<figcaption>Alexia Williams participates in flat tail horned lizard surveys in the Yuha Desert in California.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>These projects that Williams works on include a lot of collaboration, she said. Often, there are multiple agencies, cities, and even states collaborating on different projects, she explained. For example, the Gila District cooperates with several local cities, counties, and friends’ groups in water management such as groundwater and surface water monitoring and modeling.</p>

<p>“In seeing that kind of collaboration, you would have no idea it is taking place if you're not involved in it,” she said. “That is an interesting aspect of this position.”</p>

<p>The Bureau of Land Management’s Gila District alone encompasses the management of over two million acres of desert, mountains, and grasslands in eastern and southeastern Arizona – and this management is supported by countless partnerships and other agencies. The BLM partners with many diverse organizations to carry out our multiple-use mission.</p>

<p>“Managing for multiple uses definitely poses a challenge, but hopefully the decisions now will lead to a more sustainable future,” she said.<br>
<br>
“I love that public lands support a variety of activities such as free camping and hiking, fee sites with amenities such as boat launches, filming and photography, birdwatching, picnicking, orienteering, rocket-launching, etc., and the fact that there are landscapes that are protected such as Wilderness Areas,” she said. “Visitors come from all over the world to take advantage of these opportunities, and it would be awesome if more Americans were aware of these resources right here at home.”</p>
