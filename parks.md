<p>ARCATA, Calif.  –  The Bureau of Land Management has completed restoration of the 114-year-old Punta Gorda Light Station overlooking the Pacific Coast along the Lost Coast Trail south of Eureka. The rehabilitation project was partially funded by $2.8 million received through the Great American Outdoors Act.</p>

<p>In addition to restoring the scenic quality of the two-story lighthouse and adjacent oil house, renovations included repairing railings and replacing a spiral stairway leading to the lighthouse lantern room and deck. The project was planned and supervised by a team of BLM Arcata Field Office staff members with expertise ranging from engineering to wildlife biology.</p>

<p>“A challenging aspect was completing the work without disturbing a colony of northern elephant seals and harbor seals protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act,” said Paul Sever, manager of the BLM King Range National Conservation Area. “We had a four-month window of work time and monitored the seals constantly for any sign of disturbance. We were happy to see that the seals tolerated our project well.”</p>

<p>The light station, a beacon for ship navigation, was built in 1910. Its light was fueled by oil stored in the nearby and now-restored oil house. The station also included housing and other wooden structures. The light station was deactivated in 1951 and the Fresnel lens used to cast the lighthouse beam far out to sea was removed. The station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.  </p>

<p>The light station is near the Mattole Trailhead at the north end of the King Range National Conservation Area, near the community of Petrolia. Hiking to the site requires planning and caution due to creek crossings, a trail section that is only passable at low tide, and the potential for unpredictably high waves. Information on day hiking to the site and backpacking the Lost Coast Trail safely is available from the BLM King Range Office at 707-986-5400.<br />

<p class="MsoBodyText">PALM SPRINGS, Calif. – <a name="_Hlk144204777" id="_Hlk144204777">The Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comment on new solar energy work in eastern Riverside County. If approved, the Sapphire Project could generate and store up to 117 megawatts of photovoltaic solar energy and deliver renewable electricity to the statewide transmission grid.</a></p>

<p>The project would include approximately 41 acres of public lands for access roads, facilities, and lines to transmit the power. The planned solar panel arrays, battery energy storage, and related facilities would sit on about 1,082 acres of adjoining private land.</p>

<p>“Clean energy remains a BLM top priority,” said California Desert District Manager Shelly Lynch.  “BLM-managed public lands offer a tremendous opportunity to advance solar technology, and we value public input in the process.” </p>

<p>The BLM plans to hold a public meeting on Monday, Jan. 8, from 5:30-7:30 p.m. at the Lake Tamarisk Golf Course Clubhouse (also known as the CSA Hall), located at 26251 Parkview Drive, in Desert Center. A virtual public meeting will be held via Zoom on Tuesday, Jan. 9, from 5:30-7:30 p.m. Please <a href="https://blm.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_QUzqa0LjQvuA_316CrivDA#/registration">register in advance</a> to attend the virtual meeting.</p>

<p>During the 30-day public scoping period, the BLM will gather input that will help inform an environmental assessment considering the proposal. The comment period closes January 18, 2024. Written comments may be <a name="_Hlk149124639" id="_Hlk149124639">submitted through the “Participate Now” function at the </a><a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2030262/510">BLM National NEPA Register</a> (preferred), emailed to blm_ca_pssc_sapphire@blm.gov, or delivered to the Palm Springs – South Coast Field Office (Attn:  Sapphire Project) located at 1201 Bird Center Drive in Palm Springs, CA 92262.</p>

<p>The BLM manages vast stretches of public lands that have the potential to make significant contributions to the nation’s renewable energy portfolio. To promote the development of these energy sources, the BLM provides sites for environmentally sound development of renewable energy on public lands. The efficient deployment of renewable energy from our nation’s public lands is crucial in achieving the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, as well as Congress’ direction in the Energy Act of 2020 to permit 25 gigawatts of solar, wind, and geothermal production on public lands no later than 2025.</p>

<p>For additional information, please contact Amanda Moore, Project Manager, at 503-930-4133.</p>
