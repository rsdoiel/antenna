## UC graduate student researchers secure increases in employment rates, wages

date: 2024-01-30, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

Academic workers reached an agreement with the UC on Monday to increase wages and employment rates for graduate student researchers.
Affected researchers will receive raises as high as $10,000 per year, according to a United Auto Workers Local 2865 press release from Monday afternoon.&#160;
Since UAW and the UC came to an agreement on their historic contract in December 2022, graduate student researchers – previously under Student Researchers United-UAW before its merger with UAW Local 2865 in February – argued that UC management ignored its contract and manipulated full-time equivalent percentages of student researcher appointments to short them on pay.

“I Saw the TV Glow” is breaking through the static of the horror genre.
After making their narrative film debut at Sundance 2021 with their lo-fi horror film “We’re All Going to the World’s Fair,” writer-director Jane Schoenbrun returned to this year’s festival with “I Saw the TV Glow.” The filmmaker’s A24-produced sophomore entry centers on lonely teenagers Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine) who find solace in their favorite television show, “The Pink Opaque.”
Smith, Lundy-Paine and cast member Ian Foreman spoke with the Daily Bruin’s Graciana Paxton at the Sundance Film Festival about the ways in which the coming-of-age horror explores media obsessions, isolation and identity.
