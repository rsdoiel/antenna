## YouTube revenue and recent good ones

<p>There&apos;s an interesting trend in YouTube land lately, which is prominent creators talking about how little they make from YouTube/Google itself, instead needing brand deals to advertise a product inside their videos to truly make a living. </p><p>For high-end channels that put out weekly videos, they often</p>

## Daily AI Tools

date: 2025-05-27, from: Paolo Valdemarin's blog

Here’s a snapshot of what AI tools and how am I using them on this 27th of May 2025. Things change fast, I’m writing this for my future self who will be moved while reminiscing these pioneering times. I more or less always have the Claude and ChatGPT apps running. Recently I have also created a &#8230; <a href="https://val.demar.in/2025/05/daily-ai-tools/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "Daily AI Tools"</span></a>

## Take My Hand, Precious Lord

date: 2025-05-27, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><em>Take My Hand, Precious Lord</em> (also known as the inverse <em>Precious Lord, Take My Hand</em>) is an old gospel hymn with a unique and special tie-in to the American Civil Rights story. Written in 1932 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Dorsey">Thomas Dorsey</a> after he co-founded National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses (NCGCC), the tune borrowed from a 1844 hymn called “Maitland” (George N. Allan) and took inspiration from a performance of the song by Blind Connie Williams.</p>
<p>The song was written after the death of Dorsey’s wife Nettie and his son during childbirth. Tragic doesn’t even begin to describe the situation. You feel the heartache in the simple refrain, “I am tired, I am weak, I am worn”. It’s a cry for help and comfort beyond what the world can offer.</p>
<p>One notable fan of the song was MLK. Dr. King would often asked Mahalia Jackson to sing this particular song at civil rights rallies. He even made her promise to sing the song at his funeral. And on April 4th, 1968 outside the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, Dr. King’s last recorded words were to musician Ben Branch for an event he was performing that evening…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ben, make sure you play ‘Take My Hand, Precious Lord’ in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moments later, Dr. King was shot and died on the way to the hospital. This began a bit of a tradition with this song.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WduYIw8Yrnw">Mahalia sang the song at Dr. King’s funeral in 1968</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/GoBaMglyKh0">Aretha sang the song at Mahalia’s funeral in 1972</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPAvIMC9g14">Aretha sang the song at the MLK memorial dedication in 2011</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay2Fi_Ao_tU">Fantasia sang the song at Aretha’s funeral in 2018</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dozens of famous people from Bruce Springsteen to Nina Simone have sung versions of this song, but to me the best recorded version of this song comes from Aretha Franklin’s groundbreaking and award-winning gospel album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4eiQmJsSsI"><em>Amazing Grace</em>, recorded in Los Angeles in 1972</a> which is also an <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/amazing-grace-2018/">incredible documentary</a> (2018) if you haven’t already seen it already. The choir and the bassist do most of the work but it punches you right in the gut. At one point Aretha appears to sing the wrong verse over the choir, but she knows what she’s doing. It’s layers upon layers stitched inside a medley, building up a magical tapestry of song.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        G             G7
Precious Lord, take my hand,
        C
Lead me on, let me stand,
     G                      D7
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn;
            G                  G7
Through the storm, through the night,
        C
Lead me on to the light:
        G              D7
Take my hand, precious Lord,
        G     C G
Lead me home.


        G              G7
When my way grows drear,
        C
Precious Lord, linger near,
     G                     D7
When my life is almost gone,
           G             G7
Hear my cry, hear my call,
        C
Hold my hand lest I fall
        G              D7
Take my hand, precious Lord,
        G     C G
Lead me home.



         G              G7
When the darkness appears
        C
And the night draws near,
    G                      D7
And the day is past and gone,
            G        G7
At the river I stand,
         C
Guide my feet, hold my hand
        G              D7
Take my hand, precious Lord,
        G     C G
Lead me home.
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When I’m feeling the pains of the world I often think about this song. I think about how exhausting it must have been to pick yourself up under the oppression of Jim Crow. No doubt it would leave you feeling tired, weak, and worn at the end of each night. To have freedom in a free country. To have a vote. To have dignity.</p>
<p>When I’m tired at end of a night, I sit at the piano and try to play this song. It never sounds as beautiful as those who have sung it before but it hits all the same. I think this would be a wonderful song to have at a funeral. Play it real pretty.</p>

## Coming to Understandings, and Perhaps Actions

So we can move on to solving other problems. Well, shit: 404 says Penguin Poop Helps Antarctica Stay Cool.  So, rather than Web 3.0, we&#39;re at Web 2.1. Despite all its sweet aspirations, Web 2.0 brought us the Age of Walled Gardens. In Welcome to the World Wide Wall, Ted Gioia says tech giants and their wannabes [&#8230;]

## Chinese-Owned VPNs

date: 2025-05-27, updated: 2025-05-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>One one my biggest worries about VPNs is the amount of trust users need to place in them, and how opaque most of them are about who owns them and what sorts of data they retain.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/apple-offers-apps-with-ties-to-chinese-military">new study</a> found that many commercials VPNS are (often surreptitiously) owned by Chinese companies.</p>
<blockquote><p>It would be hard for U.S. users to avoid the Chinese VPNs. The ownership of many appeared deliberately opaque, with several concealing their structure behind layers of offshore shell companies. TTP was able to determine the Chinese ownership of the 20 VPN apps being offered to Apple&#8217;s U.S. users by piecing together corporate documents from around the world. None of those apps clearly disclosed their Chinese ownership...</p></blockquote>

## The elusive goal of Unix – or Linux – simplicity

date: 2025-05-27, updated: 2025-05-27, from: Liam Proven's articles at the Register

<h4><span class="label">Comment</span> Or, rediscovering the KISS principle, the long way round</h4>
      <p>Linux distro wars are nothing new. &#34;Advocacy&#34; (a euphemism for angry argument) about hardware, OSes, programming languages and editors goes back as long as different computers have existed. Computers appeal to geeky folks, and geeky folks readily get a little too attached to things — and then become possessive and defensive about them.</p>

## 2025-05-25 iPhone, GoPro, tears

date: 2025-05-27, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-25-iphone-gopro-tears">2025-05-25 iPhone, GoPro, tears</h1>

<p>I have a GoPro which I used to take a nice <a href="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-14.mov">6s video of a young whale</a> when we went to the <a href="2024-04-06-maledives">Maledives in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>I also took hours of not so important video. There is, of course, an iPhone app for the GoPro. It currently has 45 GB of videos on it. I can&rsquo;t access the iPhone from my wife&rsquo;s Mac without upgrading it.</p>

<p>So I use my Linux Laptop to connect to the phone. And my wife&rsquo;s Mac is mounted via wifi, and it has the external, encrypted hard disk where the images and videos should go. Current transfer speed is 1.3 MB/sec.</p>

<p>Sometimes I do feel the bars of the golden cage. 😔</p>

<p>And there so many random errors. Or a laptop that falls asleep. Or a duplicate filename. These things always interrupt the process and wait for user input.</p>

<p>This is where the tears come in.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23GoPro">#GoPro</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-05-27</strong>. I don’t remember why I didn’t use the SD card directly. Perhaps the file formats need converting? Perhaps my wife’s Mac doesn’t have a working card reader?</p>

<p>Standard formats. Standard connectors.</p>

## 2025-05-23 Sumartin, Dubrovnik

date: 2025-05-27, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-23-sumartin-dubrovnik">2025-05-23 Sumartin, Dubrovnik</h1>

<p>When we left our hotel in Postira, the receptionist asked where we were going next. “Dubrovnik,” we said. “Oh, you will love it,” she said. “And,” she added, “the price for walking on the old city walls is insane but it’s still worth it.” She was right. It costs 40€ per person, but it’s the kind of thing you just do once in a lifetime, as a tourist.</p>

<p>We started in Postira on the island of Brač, right across Split, but we had decided to take a different ferry and drove all the way to Sumartin and took the ferry to Makarska, then drove to Dubrovnik. Once at the hotel at Lapad Bay we put on our jogging shoes and jogged to the old town, paid the price and walked around the old town. After that, the sun started sinking and we did a quick tour on foot and jogged back.</p>

<p>Yet another marina, yet another church.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Usually, the working vessels are in different harbours or out at sea but here&rsquo;s where we saw some of them up close.
All these crates.
It makes me want to eat less seafood.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t want to stay in the car so we went to the upper deck. It was cold and windy.
We ended up staying in the car after about half an hour.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As we drove along the coast, the landscape changed.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We took a break, had some coffee, croissant and a kind of pistachio cake.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally in Dubrovnik after a long drive, with our running shoes or sandals, running towards the old town. There are plenty of hotels built into the rock face, but sometimes you can find angles were it all looks wild and green.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We paid the outrageous price and climbed those walls.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is May. This is off-season. This is why it&rsquo;s so empty.
But practically everybody you see is a tourist and practically every shop you see is a restaurant or a souvenir shop.
It&rsquo;s like a stage.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is the entrance into the city. A mass of fortifications and rings.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Still the entrance, with a bridge over the former ditch.
And people and cars.
Happily, no cars inside the old town.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This cove is protected by another fort, disconnected from the main walls.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The soldiers used to be smaller, I guess.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Inside the walls, there are still ruins.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-13.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Outside the walls, the rock face.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-14.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a hill behind the old town and a cable car that goes up there.</p>

<p>You can see the wall with people on it on the left, and you can see that sometimes the ruins meld into patios and terraces and there are still people living there.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-15.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Claudia looking into the evening sun.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-16.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking back at that little cove protected by that separate fort.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-17.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking back inside into courtyards and houses interspersed with crumbling walls.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-18.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Somebody built a tunnel through the city wall and now there&rsquo;s a coffee house on the outside, on the rock face between city walls and the sea.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-19.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Claudia is taking pictures of gardens and orchards within the city walls.
There were some cats down there as well and I think at least half the tourists were meowing from the walls, trying to get some sort of reaction out of the cats.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-20.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking across an orchard into an alley.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-21.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sometimes the interesting plants grow on inaccessible roofs. And in the back is a school, I guess, because there&rsquo;s one of these multi-functional sport courts visible. Notice how all of this is invisible from the alleys.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-22.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>More ruins. And a guy chilling in the back, looking at his phone.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-23.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I guess the 40€ per person go towards wall maintenance. There was a part along the walls where new constructions were happening.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-24.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After having circled around half the old town, there&rsquo;s a bigger harbour, also protected by extra forts.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-25.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking at the rooftop landscape makes me think of books and games where thieves run around on these roofs, jumping across alleys. Never!!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-26.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The old moat is a road and sometimes there are parking lots.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-27.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The sun began to set. Notice another basketball court in the lower right corner.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-28.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Stairs.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-23-dubrovnik-29.jpg" alt="" /></p>

## Kristi Noem vs. Harvard: What Their Language Reveals.

date: 2025-05-26, from: James Fallows, Substack

'In the life of the human spirit, words are action,' a US president said long ago. Let's look at words from a cabinet secretary who doesn't know what 'habeas corpus' means, vs. a university that does.

## Ecology vs. Egology

date: 2025-05-26, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Back in 2008, while working for a startup, Hugh MacLeod and I contrasted the distributed, decentralized, participatory tech development culture of the time with the centralized, top-down kind that had dominated for the prior few decades—and, let&#8217;s face it, still does today. Hugh drew the cartoon above to illustrate what we thought was going on [&#8230;]

## Helping Harvard?

date: 2025-05-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I feel like I should help Harvard, because Harvard helped me, and if you use podcasting or RSS, it helped you too. </p>
<p>In 2002, I was ready to leave Silicon Valley, and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> needed a safe place to be parked, or I felt the tech industry would keep trying to own it, and make it far more complicated than it needed to be. And I wanted the intellectuals of academia to blog. </p>
<p>So I knocked on the door at Harvard, because I heard they had a program that was close to being up my alley -- the Berkman Center for the Internet and Society. My friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a> was a founding member. I figured if they could handle a Grateful Dead lyricist, and general muck-raking rabble-rouser like <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Barlow">Barlow</a>, they might be able to appreciate someone of my creative caliber. They accepted me, gave me run of the place, defended us when we got in trouble and great things came from it. But I always felt like a bit of a thorn in the side of the great elite Harvard University. </p>
<p>Yet I really really really appreciate what they did, but I think what I have to offer might not be appreciated. </p>
<p>I think they should take advantage of their unique perspective on what's happening in the US, and cover it in a way that no news organization would or could, but the way a great, challenged, <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/in-focus/harvard-and-the-american-revolution/">revolutionary</a> academic institution would. And it might be that the people who would destroy it don't want to take the risk that Harvard might be heard, and it might be a bit premature for them to think they can take control of an organization that in a sense represents the best of the USA since 1636. </p>
<p>PS: When Harvard was 140 years old it stood against the King of England in the <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/10/harvards-year-of-exile/">American Revolution</a>. The Continental Army lived on the Harvard Campus in 1775 and 1776. The precedent for revolution is baked into the soul of Harvard, it seems to me. </p>

## The Halliburton Choke

date: 2025-05-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I never really had any opinion about the Indiana Pacers. </p>
<p>Honestly I was surprised they even made the playoffs this year.</p>
<p>And they did catch the Knicks with their pants down, after clearing out the reigning champion Boston Celtics in the second round of the playoffs this year, it took some time before they found their balance again. We learned, again, that we need to have some minutes every game where Brunson takes a long well-deserved rest, so there's room for KAT to lead the team (our other all-star and all-NBA player), and make sure the other Knicks get a chance to shine, and give the Pacers something to guess about. Brunson is great at charging the rim against all odds, but you don't make the Finals if that's the only trick in your quiver. Hopefully we don't have to keep learning that lesson. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/26/halliburtonChoke.png"></center>The Halliburton Choke.</div></p>
<p>My advice for Halliburton, take a moment and breathe and realize <i>this series isn't over.</i> The Knicks have a say in it too. And the two teams are remarkably well matched. And despite what the pundits say, there's nothing very special about the Pacers, in fact they have some growing up to do. Halliburton, if they should happen to win another game this year, should learn that either of the first two games in the series could easily have gone the other way. And so should the freaking pundits, when they focus on how great the Pacers were and how pitiful the Knicks are. The Pacers won the first game by three points, and the second one by five. And the Knicks won the third game by six. Could have gone the other way too. And the Knicks are fucking great at overcoming 20-point deficits. The absolute best in the NBA. I have to remember that too, because there was a point in yesterday's game where I gave up. Dave of little faith. </p>
<p>They will call this dance The Halliburton Choke. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/155665636105">Reggie Miller</a> made it famous and Halliburton made it ridiculous, and vice versa.  </p>

## Pete Rose

date: 2025-05-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>It was so predictable. Shortly after Pete Rose died, baseball <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/calls-escalate-against-rob-manfred-220702792.html">rescinded his lifetime ban</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=May+13%2C+2025%2C+Manfred+instituted+a+change">now he can</a> be <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pete+rose+hall+of+fame+induction">inducted</a> into the Hall of Fame. </p>
<p>I grew up with a Pete Rose ethos, why shouldn't I go for it all? I feel so sad that he couldn't have gotten the acceptance he so totally deserved. How could we not forgive him? He was Charlie Hustle! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span></p>
<p>A role model in so many ways, and like all heroes he had fatal flaws. You may think he set a bad example for kids, but I say the opposite. You don't give kids enough credit. </p>
<p>What he taught was that a man with average athletic ability could will himself to achieve. </p>
<p>He had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose#Records_and_achievements">more hits</a> than any baseball player ever. </p>

Really enjoying the NBA playoffs, even though the Knicks are still in it. Nice turnaround after the first quarter for the Minnesotas. Still hoping for a finals between them and the Knicks. It'll be interesting to see how the Knicks change their lineup. Hopefully no more isolation-ball with Brunson. It's boring and doesn't work. Melo 2.0. Might make sense if he was LeBron, but he's not and LeBron's game is boring anyway. Let's do this well, win or lose.
