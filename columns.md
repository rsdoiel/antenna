## Nothing makes me want to hire someone less than them showing an open to work badge

date: 2025-05-20, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

I just came across a post on X that stated &#8220;nothing makes me want to hire someone less than this&#8221;, with a picture of the &#8220;open to work&#8221; badge LinkedIn offers job seekers. This being X, I thought I answer using appropriate voice: This, albeit succinct, is not very enlightening, so let me elaborate&#8230; Like [&#8230;]

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/17/dewey.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've been looking up all kinds of things now that my new Daytona search engine has access to my blogging going back to 1994. I just did a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=mullenweg">search for Mullenweg</a>, and came up with this <a href="https://ma.tt/2006/04/feed-validator/">blog post</a> by Matt in 2006 about the Feed Validator. The clarity is remarkable, and he's of course right. The people running the validator were actually promoting Atom over RSS, and were trying to tilt the table towards Atom. The goal was <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop">interop</a>, not to give Google or IBM control of the syndication format of the open web. When you keep changing your mind about what to flag and what to pass you end up with a standard that's as murky as the tariff policy of the US in 2025. I think you have to assume that was the goal. They didn't like that RSS didn't fall apart when Atom came out. If there's no benefit in changing, people don't.

## DoorDash Hack

date: 2025-05-20, updated: 2025-05-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A DoorDash driver <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669140/doordash-driver-convicted-delivery-scam">stole</a> over $2.5 million over several months:</p>
<blockquote><p>The driver, Sayee Chaitainya Reddy Devagiri, placed expensive orders from a fraudulent customer account in the DoorDash app. Then, using DoorDash employee credentials, he manually assigned the orders to driver accounts he and the others involved had created. Devagiri would then mark the undelivered orders as complete and prompt DoorDash&#8217;s system to pay the driver accounts. Then he&#8217;d switch those same orders back to &#8220;in process&#8221; and do it all over again. Doing this &#8220;took less than five minutes, and was repeated hundreds of times for many of the orders,&#8221; writes the US Attorney&#8217;s Office...</p></blockquote>

## Andrew Hickey

date: 2025-05-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2tjsq6a4vn6pww2iva5qj23v">Andrew Hickey</a> whose <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/">podcast</a> I support, also appears to be strongly against people using ChatGPT. </p>
<p>I am a programmer, so you might think I'd see it the same way because what I do is similar to what musicians and prose writers do in that I create "intellectual property" which can be easily copied.</p>
<p>But we have a different culture in software, we tend to by default share what we do and let other people use it. They're supposed to credit us, but people are selfish and greedy and they will tend to take whatever isn't bolted down, and it sucks, but you accept it.</p>
<p>What's funny is Hickey appears to have no clue how much he's benefited from this ethos. His success probably would not have been possible without some people thinking it's more important to create the medium he could use any way he saw fit, than to own one that would probably have kept him out.</p>
<p>Creating is not as linear as he appears to think, which so ironic because that's basically what his freaking podcast is about. He loves to say "no one did anything first" (paraphrasing) and that's basically the <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html">same idea</a>.</p>
<p>And I don't doubt that the next big media invention, the next <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=podcasting">podcasting</a> perhaps, will benefit enormously from having ChatGPT available for the people developing it.</p>
<p>PS: This appeared earlier as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lpjn22v22s2k">post</a> on Bluesky. And I wrote every freaking word, as I always do unless disclaimed.</p>

## The Real Cost of Chinese Open-Source AI

date: 2025-05-19, from: Om Malik blog

Don&#8217;t believe the Chinese AI open-source hype, warns good friend, Pete Warden. Their large language models come at a price — the models are programmed to deliberately obscure historical truths, he writes on his blog. He points out that this isn&#8217;t just censorship; it&#8217;s engineered misinformation at scale, baked into the foundation of future AI. Warden compares answers to the same query using different models to support his conclusions.

Here's a search for <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22menu%20sharing%22">menu sharing</a> which was a technology we made on the Mac that allowed people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other apps. Netscape supported it as did MSIE, Quark, Eudora and many others. It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable (many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I'm going to import the home page of Scripting News from 1997 to 2010. It was mostly a linkblog then.

## The NSA’s “Fifty Years of Mathematical Cryptanalysis (1937–1987)”

date: 2025-05-19, updated: 2025-05-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In response to a FOIA request, the NSA released &#8220;<a href="https://www.governmentattic.org/58docs/NSA50YrsMathCrypt1988.pdf">Fifty Years of Mathematical Cryptanalysis (1937-1987)</a>,&#8221; by Glenn F. Stahly, with a lot of redactions.</p>
<p>Weirdly, this is the second time the NSA has declassified the document. John Young got a <a href="https://archive.org/details/NSAFiftyYearsOfMathematicalCryptanalyisis">copy</a> in 2019. This one has a few less redactions. And nothing that was provided in 2019 was redacted here.</p>

## How iPhone has evolved as a Camera

Given how much I have been using my iPhone as my everyday camera, I decided to put together this blog post to show how far Apple&#8217;s smartphone camera technology has come.

Tonight, late on a Sunday night, the House Budget Committee passed what Republicans are calling their &#8220;Big, Beautiful Bill&#8221; to enact Trump&#8217;s agenda although it had failed on Friday when far-right Republicans voted against it, complaining it did not make deep enough cuts to social programs.

I don't know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don't have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E">grabbing</a> Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can come play for the Nets. We may have room for another great team in NY.

## What an Unusual Week

date: 2025-05-18, from: Om Malik blog

It has been a week, that at best can be described as deliciously weird. I have neither been inspired to write, nor to indulge my passion for photography. Apart from necessary work, I have been out walking, and doing a lot of reading. And making notes for future writing projects. My brain is percolating, trying &#8230;
