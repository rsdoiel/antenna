## Cross-posting in 2024

date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.</p>
<p>I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.  </p>
<p>Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.</p>
<p>I can't send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface. My way of doing it is now called "legacy." The app that uses that feature doesn't work. But I don't even remotely have the time to go back and fix it.</p>
<p>The items in my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a> come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on Masto and Bluesky.</p>
<p>When I want broader distribution, I do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a new browser window.</li>
<li>Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don't know why.</li>
<li>I write some text into the Twitter tab.  </li>
<li>Paste an image if there is one.</li>
<li>I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky. </li>
<li>I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.</li>
<li>I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is too.</p>
<p>One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can't include them in this rotation. </p>
<p>I'd love to see one of these support the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. I would give them 100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn't be long before the others did it, and we'd have a much more complete network writing environment. </p>

I usually write my prompts very carefully, esp when using it to build software, but I just tried not really caring, and asking a question the way I thought of it, so it rambled a lot, was repetetive and had an error I didn't bother to correct, to see what would happen. It didn't even criticize me. It figured out what I was trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am aware that all my fellow programmers taught it how to do this, though I have no idea how it does that, but it is freaking amazing. I keep finding miracles in this tech.

## Random RSS & ActivityPub notes

date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/27/rssClub.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Back when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the XML people were asking developers to do that. "Now you can create your own formats!" The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in the back of my mind, "they don't really mean it." This was based on experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized their products when they were new, but took <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage">umbrage</a> at the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah">chutzpah</a> of the developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important, don't they know that's what BigCo's do. Anyway a few years later, that's exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the future, so they set about to do it as a "standard" and thus was born Atom. My opinion, <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way is better</a> than two, and they should have jumped on the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> bandwagon. But that's not what they do. They're still <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to make RSS unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there's no point in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to do that. It isn't going away. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>
<p>I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to create a Busy Developer's Guide to ActivityPub? Here's the prompt. "I want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post. Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js." I asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1">ChatGPT gave</a> what seems to be a reasonable outline for the project. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> is a product of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_astronaut">Architecture Astronauts</a>. Start with a simple idea but generalize it too far, so it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can anything pragmatic. It's why I said last week that they <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/28.html#a124521">need a BDG asap</a>, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I would help them design it, I'm a fairly typical "busy developer." I would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not to be revised with breakage to apps. I've also seen this happen before, in fact it happens more often than not. If you don't understand a format, you can't actually support it. This is part of the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5">you can't lie to a compiler</a> axiom. </p>

## How we feel about what we consume

date: 2024-05-05, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

This is interesting and fair, but in her larger point about consuming media by &#8216;stained&#8217; people, I think overlooks our emotional responses to learning bad things about people whose art we liked. (Note: I haven&#8217;t read the book, only this interview.) It&#8217;s possible that we as individuals read too much into what we like, that [&#8230;]

## What I‚Äôm telling my graduating students 

date: 2024-05-05, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, My students are graduating at a tremulous time. The largest campus protest movement of the 21st century. The first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. The most restrictive abortion laws in the nation. Two horrific wars. All of this coming after the first pandemic in living memory, one that claimed the lives of a million Americans. And after the first attack on the U.S. Capitol in history, provoked by the first president who refused to accept electoral defeat.

## A quick light-dark() experiment

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I wanted to experiment with the new CSS function <code>light-dark()</code> and get a sense of how to use it in a CSS architecture of nested (web) components. I think it‚Äôs going to be a powerful tool in <a href="https://web.dev/articles/new-responsive">the new responsive</a> world of component architecture but I don‚Äôt want to recommend something unless I have experience with it in a project first.</p>
<p>My first pass was to add <code>light-dark()</code> to my components‚Ä¶</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* global.css */</span>
<span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--dark</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--light</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But if every component is in charge of it‚Äôs own <code>light-dark()</code> handling for <code>border</code>, <code>background</code>, and <code>color</code> on every element‚Ä¶ the codebase will get messy managing dark mode in a lot of different places, leading to a lot of inconsistencies over time. A more elegant solution for me would be to handle this job in a single location at the root scope level and leverage the cascade a bit.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The nice thing about using <code>light-dark()</code> at the root token level is your components can be dumber. You provide default light-dark experience and, like good children, your components abide in their parent‚Äôs decision. Of course, due to the nature of CSS custom properties, your components aren‚Äôt locked into the system and your component level styles can opt out (read: not include) or override the global variables if necessary.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--surface-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--text-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">/* this is a real example from my past */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">theme</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">"lunar-new-year"</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>At this point in the experiment I was pleased with the results‚Ä¶ until I deployed it to production. I overestimated the browser support for <code>light-dark()</code> and it didn‚Äôt work on my phone running Safari 17.4 (but it‚Äôs coming in Safari 17.5). I replicated the issue by changing <code>light-dark()</code> to <code>light-d0rk()</code> to verify and fixed it by adding a tried-and-true CSS <code>@supports</code> query.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>

	<span class="c">/* NOTE: For Safari 17.4 (2024-05) */</span>
  <span class="err">@supports</span> <span class="err">(</span><span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">black</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
	  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
	  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now Safari 17.4 and other browsers that lack support will only have a dark theme and newer browsers will get the <code>light-dark()</code>  enhancement. I also threw a little <code>NOTE:</code> and datestamp in there so future versions of me will know when and <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/you-want-border-color-transparent-not-border-none/">why I built this fence</a>.</p>

## I support the students

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/05/marchOnWashington.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">As a boomer who marched on Washington as a high school student, who started an underground newspaper, and organized student strikes, I support today's students making their political opinions heard. I also see journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn't true then and I'm pretty sure it isn't true now. </p>
<p>And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not what's really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values, only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war, as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel. </p>
<p>We shouldn't have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it's exactly what Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should <i>not</i> be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust. </p>
<p>As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that's why I support the students. They aren't right or wrong, but they are continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the 2020s as it was in the 1970s.</p>

## Vibe Check ‚Ññ32

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>An unseasonable gloomy spring in Austin, TX. The kids are nearly done with school for the year and summer plans are shoring up. My son goes to middle school next year. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve battled some on-and-off sicknesses these past couple months and with all the holidays every week has felt like a false start. But here we are, barreling into summer. I‚Äôve already been out on the lake to surf on my cousin‚Äôs boat, so I‚Äôve got that going for me.</p>
<h2>The Eclipse</h2>
<p>In April my wife‚Äôs entire family came out from Arizona to Austin for the eclipse on April 8th. We got a big Vrbo near the lake right in the path of totality. The weather was cloudy and dismal in Austin for the eclipse. But then‚Ä¶ ten minutes before full totality, the sky broke open.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve seen partial eclipses before and those were cool. But nothing prepared me for seeing the total eclipse. The complete darkness. The confused birds. The sudden drop in temperature. The fully visible halo effect eminating from the sun. It‚Äôs other worldly to see the big space rock that goes around our planet move in front of the big fireball that keeps our planet alive.</p>
<p>Happy to get to celebrate something so cosmic with the family.</p>
<h2>44 and there‚Äôs so much more</h2>
<p>I turned 44 at the end of April and had an uneventful birthday. That‚Äôs how birthdays go after the big four-oh. I spent most of my day cleaning the house and watching anime. My family treated me to a ‚Äúfancy dinner‚Äù at a place with cloth napkins and the kids behaved themselves through the whole meal.</p>
<p>The highlight of my birthday was exchanging texts with some old friends who have known me for decades. Old friends like that ‚Äì even though you often live distant parallel busy lives ‚Äì have the ability to tap into a deep well of friendship. For that I am thankful.</p>
<h2>Making Games</h2>
<p>I haven‚Äôt talked about it much, because I don‚Äôt want to jinx it, but I‚Äôve been making some games in my spare time. And not one style of game either, a big swath of random ideas in different formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>A ‚ÄúGuess Who?‚Äù-style game for Panic‚Äôs <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>.</li>
<li>A one-page TTRPG. Almost everything is in place for this.</li>
<li>A 52-card deck game that I‚Äôm turning into a game for your mobile computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making games has been a fun and different way to spend my time. I don‚Äôt have much to show for all that tinkering right this minute, but soon maybe?</p>
<h2>Waiting for a life-changing email</h2>
<p>You know that feeling when your boss emails you and asks ‚ÄúHey, you got a minute?‚Äù and those minutes until you talk to your boss feels like hours as your amygdala floods your limbic system with intense, wet, hot anxiety? That‚Äôs more or less what I‚Äôve been feeling for the last two months as I waited for a life-changing email. There were two emails actually. Then that got stressful. Then I had to wait on a package.</p>
<p>To be totally honest, all that waiting nearly broke me. I‚Äôm a decently patient person but a giant cloud LOOMING over me every day that I‚Äôm unable to control is distressing. Then your friends and family and kids ask you ‚ÄúHey did that life-changing email come yet?‚Äù and you have to say ‚ÄúNope, not yet‚Äù over and over.</p>
<p>But the email did come. And so did the package. And the giant cloud of concern is slowly dissipating. And on Monday I‚Äôll embark on the next big phase of my adult life. Ominous, I know.</p>

<p>I took some time to do some deep dives both formally and informally.</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript - Almost certain I‚Äôll be using this sometime in the future, so I took a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</a> course to connect all the pieces I had scattered about in my brain.</li>
<li>LLM Vector Embeddings - All this LLM search jazz is normal vector search but with special GPT-based embeddings instead of Postgres‚Äôs default embeddings. Way less threatening or opaque to me now that I understand it.</li>
<li>Solo RPGs - I got a bit obsessed with the idea of playing a TTRPG by yourself and it inspired me to make a game.</li>
</ul>
<h3>üí™¬†Wellness</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve put on a bit of weight and that‚Äôs frustrating but I think again it‚Äôs stress-related.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking walks</li>
<li>Got a weighted vest for ‚Äúrucking‚Äù</li>
<li>Rode my new bike once</li>
</ul>
<h2>üìñ¬†<strong>Reading</strong></h2>
<p>Reading is still on a book-a-week clip. This year I‚Äôm mulling around tech and ethics, as well as reading about people who created or harnessed a new technology. I also got back into comics and have read some wonderful pieces. If it‚Äôs sci-fi themed and has good art, I‚Äôm all-in.</p>
<p><strong>Finished</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/43cI1vi">Doom Guy: Life in First Person</a>¬†by John Romero - An autobiography about the man who created DOOM.</li>

I thought this was going to be all ‚Äúrah-rah‚Äù hypefest about AI, but instead I found it a pretty sober critique with a major theme around ‚Äúcontainment‚Äù of this new technology.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3UhrHGN">The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams</a> by Douglas Adams - I as happy to finally read this classic piece of sci-fi.

</ul>
<p><strong>In Progress</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>üìù¬†<strong>Blogging</strong></h3>
<p>Slowed down a lot on blogging. That‚Äôs okay. I still have three dozen drafts but I‚Äôm being pretty choosy about where I toil. It‚Äôs easy for me to lose a weekend tinkering on a handful of posts, or piecing together a giant overly complex post like this. I need to stop doing that. Or I need to do that more often. Who knows.</p>

## Scale requires deskilling

date: 2024-05-05, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Adobe&#8217;s gambling that the creative industries will be replaced by in-house staff doing it all themselves &#8212; and maybe it&#8217;s a &#8220;good&#8221; gamble if they can convince a lot of corporations they can cut out all the photographers and stylists and creative directors because any of their staff can do &#8220;the same&#8221; with a CC [&#8230;]
