## Type-safe C-killer Delphi hits 30, but a replacement has risen

date: 2025-02-19, updated: 2025-02-19, from: Liam Proven's articles at the Register

<h4>The FOSS world has replicated most of it in Lazarus</h4>
      <p>Delphi is still very much with us, but the FOSS world also has its own, largely compatible, GUI-based Object Pascal environment – and it&#39;s worth a look.</p>

## Threads in Bluesky

date: 2025-02-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I started out doing a week to strip blue.threadcenter down to its bones, for a fresh start, but then I started getting ideas, and decided to go for it. I have the time, and Bluesky is having moment after moment and these days I'm using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, though I do check Twitter, Threads and Mastodon a few times a day, but usually there's nothing for me in those places. Anyway I'll be pointing to this post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3liihaddhsf2g">from</a> some of my experiments, so maybe nothing more interesting than this will appear here. </p>

## How to Recompile Linux (on a Raspberry Pi)

date: 2025-02-18, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How to Recompile Linux (on a Raspberry Pi)</span>

            <p>Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:</p>

<p><em>How do you recompile Linux?</em></p>

<p>In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi's Linux kernel fork</a> instead of 'mainline' linux (the upstream <a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more convenient):</p>

## An example of AI use

date: 2025-02-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to ChatGPT. Here's the prompt.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>I'm thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the trip, I don't mind going out of my way.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services and notable bike trails. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.</p>
<p>It also offered information about weather considerations. It's not necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.</p>
<p>I'm not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example because I've done this trip a number of times and was curious how things had developed.</p>
<p>Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I find a Starbucks not too far off the route I'm on. If you were plotting the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a continuum of services that have developed over the years that make information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers questions you have in the way you think of asking them. </p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67b4bace-25e8-8012-99e4-ddec819960e8 ">link to the response</a>. I've heard that sometimes people have trouble accessing these files. </p>

## My post is my house

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can't moderate comments under your own posts. </p>
<p>If someone says something abusive, it's there for everyone to see, forever.</p>
<p>I've come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes. </p>
<p>I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to feel respected.</p>
<p>A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful. </p>

<p>A simple idea, a quid pro quo.</p>

<p>We are the government of the US, Congress represents us. </p>
<p>We have been too passive. </p>
<p>But then, they have to include us in governing. </p>
<p>No more shutting off the connection after the election.</p>

## Slow down please

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I'd restart the online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election Day. 2. I'd get out the message over and over about how things are going too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what's happening. Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun to make my statement, but I'm afraid this is going too far. I think we can all relate to that. We aren't being represented here. </p>
<p>I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to visualize what it feels like to be watching what's happening in the US from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure out what you're doing. </p>

<p>Funny detail: this was the sort of thing I toon pride in the .net world “I made sure the finalizer code ran on the right thread before it became an issue”.</p><p>And here I was, struggling to fight my very signature move.</p>

<p>I find myself whistling the theme song of severance, and I think the music has a lot more to say about the show than the show has shown so far.</p>

<p>I was about to post a complain about swift concurrency and the more I twisted myself into a pretzel the less aware I was of a thread misuse I was attempting.</p><p>I was working extra hard to attempt to use a thread bound API from the wrong thread.</p><p>In practice this would have crashed.</p>

<p>I love the threads on /r/AskHistorians which are like &ldquo;how historically accurate is this Disney movie?&rdquo; Pretty sure the answer is &ldquo;not very&rdquo;. People can&rsquo;t turn into frogs either, just fyi. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It's not a very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition, different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our meltdown with a better design.

Great quote from a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=severance+s2e5">favorite show</a>. "He put the dick in contradiction." This is a show that doesn't often indulge in that kind of humor. I imagine they must've had a great time with it in the writer's room. Or was it ad-lib'd? And wtf does it mean?

I sure do. It has never happened before. But it has happened now, and the group that is governing is doing it illegally, and is dismantling the country as quickly as they can, assuming someone will at some point try to stop them? Is that correct? What comes next?

## OpenSSL does a QUIC API

date: 2025-02-16, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

But will it satisfy the world? I have blogged several times in the past about how OpenSSL decided to not ship the API for QUIC a long time ago, even though the entire HTTP world was hoping for it &#8211; or even expecting it. OpenSSL rejected the proposal to merge the proposed API and thereby &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/02/16/openssl-does-a-quic-api/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">OpenSSL does a QUIC API</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

After World War II, the vast majority of Americans&#8212;Democrats and Republicans alike&#8212;agreed that the federal government should regulate business, provide a basic social safety net, promote infrastructure, and protect civil rights.
