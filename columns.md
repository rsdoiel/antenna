## Who is Elon Musk?

date: 2025-02-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Journalism is as usual writing news they could have written last year and should have if they weren't dreaming that somehow we'd escape End of Democracy 2.0. And we know how that turned out, about the same as <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Hillary%27s%20Emails%22">Hillary's Emails</a>. </p>
<p>Who is Elon Musk? Until I read his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Wikipedia profile</a> last week, I only had a vague idea. I wanted to know if he was actually raised in South Africa, when he left, and what influence it had on him. I'll let you read the article. We should be examining every nook and cranny of who this unelected guy who never was in a debate, or won a primary or an election, or had his background investigated, and remains untouched by any kind of examination. </p>
<p>His security detail was just <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/elon-musk-private-security-deputized-marshals-service/index.html">deputized</a> by the <a href="https://www.usmarshals.gov/">US Marshals Service</a>. What next? Maybe they'll just give him control of the military and get on with it. You can see that's coming, maybe in March, or sooner. </p>
<p>Do you think he'd have any <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/compunction">compunction</a> against using the military against Americans? This isn't his country. So Americans probably mean nothing special to him. Since we played a role in the overthrow of their apartheid, probably the opposite. I wonder who or what he cares about. Has he ever answered a question without deflecting? Is there any reporter who could or would interview him? </p>
<p>If journalism were really doing their job seriously, they would report on this because this is what we're thinking. When will jouralism get that they are one of us, not above us? The sooner that light goes on, the better.  </p>
<p>Here's a good story for one of fierce courageous reporters at the NY Times. Who should be more scared of what's coming? Blacks or Jews?</p>

"We know why Musk is cutting so much, it's to fund a huge tax cut for billionaires." They don't actually know that and I doubt it's true. Show me another example where Musk did anything to benefit anyone but himself? Why should he share the loot he's grabbing with other rich folk? What did they do to help? Nah I think it's all for him, with a taste going to the Trump and Putin families. He's going to use his new power to buy something else. The question is what? What else could he want? I imagine he wants <i>all the money</i> in the world not just the most.

## Musk's exclusive

date: 2025-02-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Can you imagine how livid developers of other AI platforms are that Musk gets exclusive access to all the private information stored in US government databases.</p>
<p>Imagine Bezos calling Trump.</p>
<p>"Hey I thought we were friends. I can send you another billion. 2 billion? 100 billion?" </p>
<p>"Call Elon, if he says it's OK I'll sign the order."</p>
<p>Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Oracle, OpenAI, etc etc.</p>

## Complying with the Online Safety Act

date: 2025-02-21, from: Shady Characters blog

<p>In October 2023, the <abbr class="initialism">UK</abbr> government passed into law the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">Online Safety Act</a>, a set of regulations intended to make online services more responsible for the content they carry. It is a laudable aim, but unfortunately the distinctions the Act draws between large sites such as Facebook and Google and smaller sites such as this one are insufficiently well defined. The upshot is that complying with the Act places a much larger burden on the owners of sites such as <cite>Shady Characters</cite> than it does on the owners of those larger sites.</p><a class="more-link" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2025/02/online-safety-act/">Read more →</a>

## 2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed

date: 2025-02-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-19-bots-again-cursed">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</h1>

<p>I’m on a trip and once again the bot fuckers are at it. Long term load
average is 0.5; I have two cores so I can handle an average load of
2.0; but when I looked at my sites this morning load was at 110. Some
idiot is training their AI again, is my guess.</p>

<p>I switched off Emacs Wiki and Community Wiki for the time being.
They&rsquo;ll be back when the AI bros are tired of downloading every link.</p>

<p>Munin shows load goin up and up and then Munin breaks down…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-1.jpg" alt="A Muningraph" /></p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Emacs">#Emacs</a></p>

<p>Compare this shit I should be dealing with to the stuff I want to look at:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-2.jpg" alt="Sunrise" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-3.jpg" alt="Mountains" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-4.jpg" alt="Snow" /></p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the new deal: I&rsquo;m redirecting any request containing &ldquo;rcidonly&rdquo; in the query string to <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/nobots">nobots</a>. This parameter is used when showing recent changes for just a single page (&ldquo;show all changes&rdquo;), or for showing a feed for just one page. These are valid links but when the Internet ingesting machines start slurping, these endpoints are too expensive. This redirect to the static page already saves us a lot of resources.</p>

<p>In addition to that, I wrote a fail2ban filter <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> containing this:</p>

<pre><code>[Definition]
# www.emacswiki.org:443 000.000.000.000 - - [19/Feb/2025:00:05:14 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1728421966&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_FacesPerBuffer&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 7168 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.127 Safari/537.36&quot;
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>

<p>And I added a section using this filter to my jail <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>

<p>And when I check it, it already contained some bots:</p>

<pre><code># fail2ban-client status alex-bots
Status for the jail: alex-bots
|- Filter
|  |- Currently failed: 166
|  |- Total failed:     474
|  `- File list:        /var/log/apache2/access.log
`- Actions
   |- Currently banned: 0
   |- Total banned:     9
   `- Banned IP list:
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2025-02-20</strong>. I had some further problems.</p>

<p>The web interface to my IRC servers no longer worked.
The Lounge reported timeout errors.</p>

<p>So I investigated the IRC server and that seemed to work.
I noticed that no numbers appeared on Munin so I was confused.
I added a config for Monit, thinking that perhaps I&rsquo;d get more info.
But no, everything seemed to work.
I even managed to log on using the <code>irc</code> program (ircII):</p>

<pre><code>irc blog-reader SSLIRC/campaignwiki.org:6697
</code></pre>

<p>Munin also didn&rsquo;t show other info, like Apache data.
Apparently that&rsquo;s due to me deleting the <code>000-default.conf</code> file which ensures that localhost is in fact a virtual host. Without it, there&rsquo;s no way to access <code>http://localhost/server-info</code> and  <code>http://localhost/server-status</code>.
Well, I fixed that, but still no numbers.</p>

<p>This is when I realized that The Lounge managed to connect to other IRC servers.
It was only failing for my own server.
And I started thinking.</p>

<p>All these symptoms pointed to me being blocked by my own firewall.
And so it was!</p>

<p>This even explained another small setup problem where two of my sites behind Apache were being served by one service that listened on the same port but for two domains. Those requests also were getting lost.
I rewrote that particular setup so that each site is now proxied directly and therefore listens for <code>localhost</code> and a port instead of a hostname and a port. Because that second pathway goes through the firewall.</p>

<p>Yikes! So much headache only because I had blocked myself.</p>

Once again Maddow is must-watch destination TV this year. Keep on going. One thing to watch out for, Bluesky <i>will</i> disappoint you. Don't blame them when it happens, because they can't be as good as people think they are. They're a startup in a tough market. Sooner or later Musk is going to aim at them (maybe he already is) and they will have to seek refuge somewhere, and all big tech companies are bastards. There isn't one of them you can trust with your democracy. So keep that in mind, and when you see open billionaire-proof social networks rise up, give them a little the Rachel we love.

## An LLM Trained to Create Backdoors in Code

## ★ Thoughts and Observations on Today’s iPhone 16e Announcement

date: 2025-02-20, updated: 2025-02-21, from: Daring Fireball

The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it’s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less.

One more thing. I like watching Maddow nowadays. She seems unstuck. And she's talking straight to the Repubs, and not with resignation, with the idea that maybe finally enough is enough, and they might work with us to save what we can of this great country. Also like that Bernie Sanders is on the road campaigning in swing districts that are held by Repubs, to see if he can squeeze out a few defectors from the ranks of House Republicans. Very important, because the Repub margin there is only 3. Just have to flip 2. America has to start moving now, or it's going to take a long long time to come back from this. The sooner we all get that, and that <i>we</i> are part of it, the better things will turn out, imho.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/goodhumortruck.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I don't like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3likjorqzmk23">social networks</a> as they're currently configured. The idea that it's some kind of conversation -- no it really doesn't resemble a conversation. I would like to try a social network that didn't have the concept of replying to a post. Give each other a little more distance. It still would be a graph, people following other people, but you wouldn't be able to insert something into someone else's flow, which is where all the indecency comes from imho. Or let replies be only visible to the person it's in reply to, so you don't end up getting speeches under your posts. And so that people with a lot of followers don't bother reading anything that's related to what they wrote, and thus no new ideas can enter the flow. We've been doing this, the way we do it, since the inception of Twitter in 2006. For some reason the design of that network is considered sacred. I was a math major who studied combinatorics, specifically graph theory -- and the Twitter way of organizing people and discourse is just one of many ways people could be arranged. Predictably, the weird structure of Twitter is turning into the structure of our society. If we want to change things the fastest way might be to do another look at what Twiiter does and see if we can't intentionally make something that works better for whatever we think we should be doing with it, other than staring at the evil people on the other side and saying how evil they are (or hopeless, or woke or whatever bullshit the influencers have made up). And with that I wish you a good evening and note that tomorrow is another day. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Device Code Phishing

date: 2025-02-19, updated: 2025-02-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>This isn&#8217;t new, but it&#8217;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">increasingly popular</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technique is known as device code phishing. It exploits &#8220;device code flow,&#8221; a form of authentication formalized in the industry-wide <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-07#section-3.4">OAuth standard</a>. Authentication through device code flow is designed for logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These devices typically don&#8217;t support browsers, making it difficult to sign in using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.</p>
<p>Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a computer or other device that&#8217;s easier to sign in with and enters the code. The remote server then sends a token to the input-constrained device that logs it into the account...</p></blockquote>

## Threads in Bluesky

<p>I started out doing a week to strip blue.threadcenter down to its bones, for a fresh start, but then I started getting ideas, and decided to go for it. I have the time, and Bluesky is having moment after moment and these days I'm using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, though I do check Twitter, Threads and Mastodon a few times a day, but usually there's nothing for me in those places. Anyway I'll be pointing to this post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3liihaddhsf2g">from</a> some of my experiments, so maybe nothing more interesting than this will appear here. </p>

## How to Recompile Linux (on a Raspberry Pi)

date: 2025-02-18, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How to Recompile Linux (on a Raspberry Pi)</span>

            <p>Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:</p>

<p><em>How do you recompile Linux?</em></p>

<p>In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi's Linux kernel fork</a> instead of 'mainline' linux (the upstream <a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more convenient):</p>

## An example of AI use

date: 2025-02-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to ChatGPT. Here's the prompt.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>I'm thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the trip, I don't mind going out of my way.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services and notable bike trails. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.</p>
<p>It also offered information about weather considerations. It's not necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.</p>
<p>I'm not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example because I've done this trip a number of times and was curious how things had developed.</p>
<p>Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I find a Starbucks not too far off the route I'm on. If you were plotting the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a continuum of services that have developed over the years that make information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers questions you have in the way you think of asking them. </p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67b4bace-25e8-8012-99e4-ddec819960e8 ">link to the response</a>. I've heard that sometimes people have trouble accessing these files. </p>

I don&#8217;t remember the story at all, or who the company was. But it sounds about right.</p>

Today is Presidents Day, a somewhat vague holiday placed in 1968 on the third Monday in February, near the date of George Washington&#8217;s birthday on February 22, 1732, but also traditionally including Abraham Lincoln, who was born on February 12, 1809.

## ★ Golfo del Gringo Loco

date: 2025-02-18, updated: 2025-02-19, from: Daring Fireball

Much serious thought and consideration, from very smart people in Mountain View and Cupertino, went into determining how to respond to a profoundly silly and thoughtless executive order. Yet that response is disturbing.

## Maybe I need re-writer’s block

date: 2025-02-17, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

I&#8217;ve never had writer&#8217;s block. Give me a writing assignment and I&#8217;ll blab something out. It might even be good, or at least good enough. But I don&#8217;t write in final draft. Or talk that way. I know people who can do either or both. But I don&#8217;t know how they do it, much as [&#8230;]

## My post is my house

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can't moderate comments under your own posts. </p>
<p>If someone says something abusive, it's there for everyone to see, forever.</p>
<p>I've come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes. </p>
<p>I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to feel respected.</p>
<p>A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful. </p>

## My offer to Democrats in DC

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A simple idea, a quid pro quo.</p>
<p>If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate that we will support them. </p>
<p>We are the government of the US, Congress represents us. </p>
<p>We have been too passive. </p>
<p>But then, they have to include us in governing. </p>
<p>No more shutting off the connection after the election.</p>
<p>Seems like a fair deal.</p>

## Slow down please

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I'd restart the online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election Day. 2. I'd get out the message over and over about how things are going too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what's happening. Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun to make my statement, but I'm afraid this is going too far. I think we can all relate to that. We aren't being represented here. </p>
<p>I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to visualize what it feels like to be watching what's happening in the US from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure out what you're doing. </p>

BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It's not a very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition, different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our meltdown with a better design.
