## Day 3 of WordLand

date: 2025-02-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This started out as a post on the support group, but it became a post that needed to be on the blog. </p>
<p>The groundrules here are -- if you see a problem in the support group and you can help with it, please give it a try and speak up. </p>
<p>It's important to develop a community here if the <a href="https://wordland.social/">product</a> is going to gain users, and become solid for all people and achieve all its potential for blazing a new trail. If it's just me, the results are predictable and not good -- I'm one old man here, with limited capability. The product still has issues, so there is still plenty of work to do, but I think the result will be worth it. </p>
<p>The goal is to bootstrap something new -- a social network without all the problems of Twitter et al. Ultimately the limits they impose on writers are unacceptable. I've waited for them to fix these problems for 18 years now, and I've come to see, amazingly, they don't see them as problems. They are happy to have writers paste images of their writing instead of the words themselves. Or break their writing up into 300-character chunks that are basically impossible to read and a bitch to write. And no titles, no editing, no style, no links. And they call it the web? (End of editorial.)</p>
<p>If this works, it will blaze a trail for new products on both sides, reading and writing. We've got reading covered from a technical standpoint with FeedLand, and some good UI, I want to integrate them with WordLand. And, as with everything based on RSS, you can replace my stuff with others, <i>easily.</i> Unlike the twitter-like systems, which are monolithic, and rely on federation (which imho doesn't actually work) to make it possible for components to be replaced. They should have all started with RSS and slowly and carefully added features without sacrificing the replaceability of components. Instead they decided, imho unwisely, to try to reinvent RSS. The result is confusion and stagnation.</p>
<p>I would also like to encourage people with WordPress experience to help come up with a template that accomadates WordLand sites in a canonical form. Makes sure WL's idea of a category is a good match with WP's. I am a very casual WordPress user as you can see from <a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/">my test site</a>. I like the template, but it has errors in it. I don't plan on becoming a WordPress expert, there are so many of you, and I have my plate full with all kinds of other stuff where I'm the only expert. </p>
<p>I chose WordPress for the same reason I chose MP3 and XML for podcasting in 2001. There's absolutely no question it's the consensus platform for web publishing. There are others, but the one that's most deeply installed is WordPress. So many people know how to make it work. It's a 20+ year thing, and they've done an <i>excellent</i> job of maintaining compatibility. Stuff we developed that worked with WordPress in the 00s still works today. That probably has a lot to do with it being the consensus. </p>
<p>Anyway, it's encouraging to see how many people are trying WordLand. Now I expect there will be lots of problem reports. It's an important time when help is needed.</p>
<p>Dave</p>

We should be declaring independence from both political parties. We have to get together with other citizens whose lives are going to be torn apart by what's happening, and the Dems are not at this time representing us. This is <i>our</i> government that is being overthrown.

<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> is where we start to boot up a simple social net using only <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> as the protocol connecting users.

I call it the <a href="https://feediverse.org/">feediverse</a>. It's not a joke, although it may incite a smile and a giggle. And that's ok.

## Vibe Check №37

date: 2025-02-22, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>As the weather in Texas flip-flops weekly between sunny Spring and snowy Winter, I’ve been dealing with a bit of personal health this last quarter. From my ADHD diagnosis, to trying meds for the first time, to back-to-back sicknesses, then constant migraines, and then I think I got the Norovirus on New Years. A debilitating time for me, but in January it started to turn around when I got some good news…</p>
<h2>“It’s not a tumor, it’s a deformity”</h2>
<p>In December I saw my primary care physician about a pain in my ankle that was causing me to hobble and at times preventing me from walking in November. It caused a lot of other issues as well; a fire-like pain in my thigh and a bump on my heel.</p>
<p>My doctor thought it might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondroma">Chondroma</a>, which is a bit scary to look up, but is like a tumor made of cartilage. That tumor can either be on the surface of the bone or inside the bone. Yikes. I got an x-ray and followed up with an orthopedic surgeon who gave me some good news that it’s not a tumor, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haglund%27s_syndrome">Haglund’s Deformity</a> also known as “pump bump” because a lot of women who wear heels often get it. The pain comes and goes based on how the tendon rubs against the bone spur.</p>
<p>Because I’m not in pain right now, the plan now is to take a non-surgical path and use anti-inflammatories to keep it at bay, saving surgery as a Plan B.</p>
<h2>The side effects of ADHD meds</h2>
<p>Last time I said I started on Qelbree, a non-stimulant ADHD medication. Non-stimulants take about five days to build up, so there’s no lightning bolt moment of clarity with non-stimulants that others describe when taking Adderall or Ritalin. It’s hard to know if it’s working, but in time I started to feel the effects.</p>
<p>The most notable one was that I was almost immune to environmental triggers like clutter and noise that overwhelm me. Whenever I encountered a mundane task like take out the trash or wash the dishes, I found it a lot easier to pick up and do without a 30-minute prep talk with my brain. That part was great… the side effects though… not so great…</p>
<p>One of Qelbree’s listed side effects is insomnia. Sure enough, I’d wake up every night at 2 AM and be awake for hours. Not quite night-brain anxiety, but just… fully awake. To combat this I read the first four books of the Murderbot Diaries back-to-back. If life hands you lemons, make emo robot lemonade.</p>
<p>The insomnia wasn’t great and I was having horrific headaches, so I switched to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine">Atomoxetine</a>, another non-stimulant SNRI that’s more common. My insurance also said they weren’t going to pay for Qelbree, so that worked out. The also don’t pay for atomoxetine, but it’s 10x cheaper so… I guess that’s a good deal? Lol.</p>
<p>I’d say “the mox” –that’s what we, the moxxers, call it– is working evident by the fact that I’ve been able to focus on some long mundane tasks at work. That’s been helpful. But it’s not without its side effects either. Weight loss is a welcomed side effect (-5 lbs) but another side effect is extreme dry mouth. My mouth is dry, y’all –how dry is it?– my mouth is so dry I’m putting lotion on my gums. My dentist said I need to buy that gel old people use to keep my mouth moisturized.</p>
<p>I guess I’ve been lucky in my life thus far because this is my first time navigating meds and side effects. What I’d like to avoid is taking more meds to counter meds, although my gum lotion already crosses that line.</p>
<h2>The rest of the story</h2>
<p>This has been a candid personal health issue of Vibe Check magazine. Behind the scenes it’s been less adventurous. A busy new year at work as my team sprints to deliver an “intra-source” design systems project. It –and the 1,000 token sidecar project– have consumed a lot of my brain and time.</p>
<p>My daughter’s mid-way through her competitive cheer season. I’m not the most extreme cheer dad, but I’m a proud one. Cheer has a lot of cross-over with child beauty pageants, but it’s a team sport where kids do flips. And it costs about 5-figures a year.</p>
<p>Hoping this bad health spat is over for now –he says as an ominous storm cloud appears above my head– and I can start employing my hands and brain to do more interesting tasks.</p>

## ★ Apple Pulls Advanced Data Protection From the UK, in Defiance of UK Demand for Global Backdoor

date: 2025-02-21, updated: 2025-02-22, from: Daring Fireball

The UK’s demands are simultaneously infuriatingly offensive, mathematically ignorant (regarding the nature of end-to-end encryption), dangerous (as proven by the recent Salt Typhoon attack China successfully waged to eavesdrop on non-E2EE communications in the United States), and laughably naive regarding the UK’s actual power and standing in the world.

## Implementing Cryptography in AI Systems

date: 2025-02-21, updated: 2025-02-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/288">How to Securely Implement Cryptography in Deep Neural Networks</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) raises the question of how can we equip them with a desired cryptographic functionality (e.g, to decrypt an encrypted input, to verify that this input is authorized, or to hide a secure watermark in the output). The problem is that cryptographic primitives are typically designed to run on digital computers that use Boolean gates to map sequences of bits to sequences of bits, whereas DNNs are a special type of analog computer that uses linear mappings and ReLUs to map vectors of real numbers to vectors of real numbers. This discrepancy between the discrete and continuous computational models raises the question of what is the best way to implement standard cryptographic primitives as DNNs, and whether DNN implementations of secure cryptosystems remain secure in the new setting, in which an attacker can ask the DNN to process a message whose &#8220;bits&#8221; are arbitrary real numbers...</p></blockquote>

## Templates for Bluesky?

## SiFive's HiFive Premier P550 is a strange, powerful RISC-V board

<p>SiFive's <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-premier-p550">HiFive Premier P550</a> is a strange board. It's the fastest RISC-V development board I've tested—though I haven't tested a <a href="https://milkv.io/pioneer">Milk-V Jupiter</a>. It's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTX_%28form_factor%29">Mini DTX</a>, which is an ATX-adjacent standard board size that won't fit in many Mini ITX SFF PC cases, which might be why SiFive and ESWIN are releasing a custom case for it (pictured above, which they sent along with the board for my review).</p>

## Who is Elon Musk?

date: 2025-02-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Journalism is as usual writing news they could have written last year and should have if they weren't dreaming that somehow we'd escape End of Democracy 2.0. And we know how that turned out, about the same as <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Hillary%27s%20Emails%22">Hillary's Emails</a>. </p>
<p>Who is Elon Musk? Until I read his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Wikipedia profile</a> last week, I only had a vague idea. I wanted to know if he was actually raised in South Africa, when he left, and what influence it had on him. I'll let you read the article. We should be examining every nook and cranny of who this unelected guy who never was in a debate, or won a primary or an election, or had his background investigated, and remains untouched by any kind of examination. </p>
<p>His security detail was just <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/elon-musk-private-security-deputized-marshals-service/index.html">deputized</a> by the <a href="https://www.usmarshals.gov/">US Marshals Service</a>. What next? Maybe they'll just give him control of the military and get on with it. You can see that's coming, maybe in March, or sooner. </p>
<p>Do you think he'd have any <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/compunction">compunction</a> against using the military against Americans? This isn't his country. So Americans probably mean nothing special to him. Since we played a role in the overthrow of their apartheid, probably the opposite. I wonder who or what he cares about. Has he ever answered a question without deflecting? Is there any reporter who could or would interview him? </p>
<p>If journalism were really doing their job seriously, they would report on this because this is what we're thinking. When will jouralism get that they are one of us, not above us? The sooner that light goes on, the better.  </p>
<p>Here's a good story for one of fierce courageous reporters at the NY Times. Who should be more scared of what's coming? Blacks or Jews?</p>

"We know why Musk is cutting so much, it's to fund a huge tax cut for billionaires." They don't actually know that and I doubt it's true. Show me another example where Musk did anything to benefit anyone but himself? Why should he share the loot he's grabbing with other rich folk? What did they do to help? Nah I think it's all for him, with a taste going to the Trump and Putin families. He's going to use his new power to buy something else. The question is what? What else could he want? I imagine he wants <i>all the money</i> in the world not just the most.

## Complying with the Online Safety Act

It is a laudable aim, but unfortunately the distinctions the Act draws between large sites such as Facebook and Google and smaller sites such as this one are insufficiently well defined.

## 2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed

date: 2025-02-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-19-bots-again-cursed">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</h1>

<p>I’m on a trip and once again the bot fuckers are at it. Long term load
average is 0.5; I have two cores so I can handle an average load of
2.0; but when I looked at my sites this morning load was at 110. Some
idiot is training their AI again, is my guess.</p>

<p>I switched off Emacs Wiki and Community Wiki for the time being.
They&rsquo;ll be back when the AI bros are tired of downloading every link.</p>

<p>Munin shows load goin up and up and then Munin breaks down…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-1.jpg" alt="A Muningraph" /></p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Emacs">#Emacs</a></p>

<p>Compare this shit I should be dealing with to the stuff I want to look at:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-2.jpg" alt="Sunrise" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-3.jpg" alt="Mountains" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-4.jpg" alt="Snow" /></p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the new deal: I&rsquo;m redirecting any request containing &ldquo;rcidonly&rdquo; in the query string to <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/nobots">nobots</a>. This parameter is used when showing recent changes for just a single page (&ldquo;show all changes&rdquo;), or for showing a feed for just one page. These are valid links but when the Internet ingesting machines start slurping, these endpoints are too expensive. This redirect to the static page already saves us a lot of resources.</p>

<p>In addition to that, I wrote a fail2ban filter <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> containing this:</p>

<pre><code>[Definition]
# www.emacswiki.org:443 000.000.000.000 - - [19/Feb/2025:00:05:14 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1728421966&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_FacesPerBuffer&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 7168 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.127 Safari/537.36&quot;
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>

<p>And I added a section using this filter to my jail <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>

<p>And when I check it, it already contained some bots:</p>

<pre><code># fail2ban-client status alex-bots
Status for the jail: alex-bots
|- Filter

</code></pre>

<p><strong>2025-02-20</strong>. I had some further problems.</p>

<p>The web interface to my IRC servers no longer worked.
The Lounge reported timeout errors.</p>

<p>So I investigated the IRC server and that seemed to work.
I noticed that no numbers appeared on Munin so I was confused.
I added a config for Monit, thinking that perhaps I&rsquo;d get more info.
But no, everything seemed to work.
I even managed to log on using the <code>irc</code> program (ircII):</p>

<pre><code>irc blog-reader SSLIRC/campaignwiki.org:6697
</code></pre>

<p>Munin also didn&rsquo;t show other info, like Apache data.
Apparently that&rsquo;s due to me deleting the <code>000-default.conf</code> file which ensures that localhost is in fact a virtual host. Without it, there&rsquo;s no way to access <code>http://localhost/server-info</code> and  <code>http://localhost/server-status</code>.
Well, I fixed that, but still no numbers.</p>

<p>This is when I realized that The Lounge managed to connect to other IRC servers.
It was only failing for my own server.
And I started thinking.</p>

<p>All these symptoms pointed to me being blocked by my own firewall.
And so it was!</p>

<p>This even explained another small setup problem where two of my sites behind Apache were being served by one service that listened on the same port but for two domains. Those requests also were getting lost.
I rewrote that particular setup so that each site is now proxied directly and therefore listens for <code>localhost</code> and a port instead of a hostname and a port. Because that second pathway goes through the firewall.</p>

<p>Yikes! So much headache only because I had blocked myself.</p>

Once again Maddow is must-watch destination TV this year. Keep on going. One thing to watch out for, Bluesky <i>will</i> disappoint you. Don't blame them when it happens, because they can't be as good as people think they are. They're a startup in a tough market. Sooner or later Musk is going to aim at them (maybe he already is) and they will have to seek refuge somewhere, and all big tech companies are bastards. There isn't one of them you can trust with your democracy. So keep that in mind, and when you see open billionaire-proof social networks rise up, give them a little the Rachel we love.

One more thing. I like watching Maddow nowadays. She seems unstuck. And she's talking straight to the Repubs, and not with resignation, with the idea that maybe finally enough is enough, and they might work with us to save what we can of this great country. Also like that Bernie Sanders is on the road campaigning in swing districts that are held by Repubs, to see if he can squeeze out a few defectors from the ranks of House Republicans. Very important, because the Repub margin there is only 3. Just have to flip 2. America has to start moving now, or it's going to take a long long time to come back from this. The sooner we all get that, and that <i>we</i> are part of it, the better things will turn out, imho.

The idea that it's some kind of conversation -- no it really doesn't resemble a conversation. I would like to try a social network that didn't have the concept of replying to a post. Give each other a little more distance. It still would be a graph, people following other people, but you wouldn't be able to insert something into someone else's flow, which is where all the indecency comes from imho. Or let replies be only visible to the person it's in reply to, so you don't end up getting speeches under your posts. And so that people with a lot of followers don't bother reading anything that's related to what they wrote, and thus no new ideas can enter the flow. We've been doing this, the way we do it, since the inception of Twitter in 2006. For some reason the design of that network is considered sacred. I was a math major who studied combinatorics, specifically graph theory -- and the Twitter way of organizing people and discourse is just one of many ways people could be arranged. Predictably, the weird structure of Twitter is turning into the structure of our society. If we want to change things the fastest way might be to do another look at what Twiiter does and see if we can't intentionally make something that works better for whatever we think we should be doing with it, other than staring at the evil people on the other side and saying how evil they are (or hopeless, or woke or whatever bullshit the influencers have made up). And with that I wish you a good evening and note that tomorrow is another day. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Device Code Phishing

date: 2025-02-19, updated: 2025-02-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>This isn&#8217;t new, but it&#8217;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">increasingly popular</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technique is known as device code phishing. It exploits &#8220;device code flow,&#8221; a form of authentication formalized in the industry-wide <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-07#section-3.4">OAuth standard</a>. Authentication through device code flow is designed for logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These devices typically don&#8217;t support browsers, making it difficult to sign in using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.</p>
<p>Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a computer or other device that&#8217;s easier to sign in with and enters the code. The remote server then sends a token to the input-constrained device that logs it into the account...</p></blockquote>

## Threads in Bluesky

date: 2025-02-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I started out doing a week to strip blue.threadcenter down to its bones, for a fresh start, but then I started getting ideas, and decided to go for it. I have the time, and Bluesky is having moment after moment and these days I'm using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, though I do check Twitter, Threads and Mastodon a few times a day, but usually there's nothing for me in those places. Anyway I'll be pointing to this post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3liihaddhsf2g">from</a> some of my experiments, so maybe nothing more interesting than this will appear here. </p>

## How to Recompile Linux (on a Raspberry Pi)

date: 2025-02-18, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How to Recompile Linux (on a Raspberry Pi)</span>

            <p>Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:</p>

<p><em>How do you recompile Linux?</em></p>

<p>In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi's Linux kernel fork</a> instead of 'mainline' linux (the upstream <a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more convenient):</p>

## An example of AI use

date: 2025-02-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to ChatGPT. Here's the prompt.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>I'm thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the trip, I don't mind going out of my way.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services and notable bike trails. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.</p>
<p>It also offered information about weather considerations. It's not necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.</p>
<p>I'm not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example because I've done this trip a number of times and was curious how things had developed.</p>
<p>Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I find a Starbucks not too far off the route I'm on. If you were plotting the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a continuum of services that have developed over the years that make information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers questions you have in the way you think of asking them. </p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67b4bace-25e8-8012-99e4-ddec819960e8 ">link to the response</a>. I've heard that sometimes people have trouble accessing these files. </p>

## Slow down please

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I'd restart the online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election Day. 2. I'd get out the message over and over about how things are going too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what's happening. Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun to make my statement, but I'm afraid this is going too far. I think we can all relate to that. We aren't being represented here. </p>
<p>I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to visualize what it feels like to be watching what's happening in the US from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure out what you're doing. </p>

<p>I love the threads on /r/AskHistorians which are like &ldquo;how historically accurate is this Disney movie?&rdquo; Pretty sure the answer is &ldquo;not very&rdquo;. People can&rsquo;t turn into frogs either, just fyi. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

We're diving head first into a world run by AI bots, before we've even begun to understand how to use them.

BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It's not a very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition, different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our meltdown with a better design.

Great quote from a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=severance+s2e5">favorite show</a>. "He put the dick in contradiction." This is a show that doesn't often indulge in that kind of humor. I imagine they must've had a great time with it in the writer's room. Or was it ad-lib'd? And wtf does it mean?

I sure do. It has never happened before. But it has happened now, and the group that is governing is doing it illegally, and is dismantling the country as quickly as they can, assuming someone will at some point try to stop them? Is that correct? What comes next?

## OpenSSL does a QUIC API

date: 2025-02-16, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

But will it satisfy the world? I have blogged several times in the past about how OpenSSL decided to not ship the API for QUIC a long time ago, even though the entire HTTP world was hoping for it &#8211; or even expecting it. OpenSSL rejected the proposal to merge the proposed API and thereby &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/02/16/openssl-does-a-quic-api/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">OpenSSL does a QUIC API</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

After World War II, the vast majority of Americans&#8212;Democrats and Republicans alike&#8212;agreed that the federal government should regulate business, provide a basic social safety net, promote infrastructure, and protect civil rights.
