date: 2024-06-23, from: Om Malik blog

On My Mind This past week, I devoted time to “personal maintenance,” undergoing the usual array of medical tests necessary to preempt potential health issues.

There's a new star in the kittyverse, <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/23/wordleKitty.png">Wordle Kitty</a>. I let her do my Wordle-play. Today, she was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2272846162922776&set=a.113966572144090&type=3&notif_id=1719149825702718&notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&ref=notif">feeling</a> a little under the weather so Wordle Kitty checked into the town urgent care center where they gave her some medicine which gave her the strength for a “splendid” performance at the days Wordle puzzle.

## Does personal AI require Big Compute?

date: 2024-06-23, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

## June 22, 2024 

date: 2024-06-23, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

This year my brother&#8217;s aluminum skiff had a stowaway. A mouse had clung tight to its perch in the bow eye during the trip from the boat&#8217;s winter berth in the front yard to the town landing, bouncing on a trailer. It continued to hold on as my brother and nephew launched the skiff and crossed the choppy harbor to a mooring.
