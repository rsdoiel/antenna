## Friday 18 October, 2024

date: 2024-10-17, from: John Naughton's online diary

Where am I? Trying to navigate London using Google maps? Quote of the Day ”We cannot say that innovation is necessarily good simply because there is a market for it.” Simon Johnson, who shared this year’s Nobel prize for economics, &#8230; <a href="https://memex.naughtons.org/friday-18-october-2024/39980/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-10-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">One of the things that makes me want to see Automattic stick around and grow is that they have a really large codebase that has been scaled, debugged and maintained for over 20 freaking years. And the most important thing -- they don't break users. The code I wrote to run against WordPress in the 00s still runs today. To me as a developer this speaks very loudly. It means it's safe to develop here. It means there's discipline in their development organization. Most companies don't do this, but the ones who do, have earned my deep respect. For all of Microsoft's sins, they were incredibly good at this too. It's why I liked working with them, and also why we laughed at each others' jokes if you can believe that. In some ways all the open source stuff is too complicated. I understand the concept of "development org" -- so I look at it that way. I dig around their codebase, see how they do things, and figure it'll work out pretty well if I just do it that way. Because the last people they're going to break are themselves. What I see on their latest APIs is maturity and completeness. They didn't rush off to the next thing before finishing. I found that in their Calypso API, which I've been building on. Honestly this is my kind of platform, it's what Manila's API would look like today probably if we had continued developing it. I'll see if I can find the docs around here somewhere. Long time ago. ;-)

It should be as easy as reading a file. Give it the URL of a feed, get back a JavaScript object that's as simple as feeds are. It can read RSS, Atom and RDF feeds, but you get the same object regardless of what form the feed was in. I'm up for creating some example apps if you're interested. There is a very simple <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/example">Hello World app</a> included in the package and a set of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos">demo apps</a>. It's MIT-licensed, so you can do whatever you want with the code. It would lovely to see it ported. The idea is to plant some seeds in the Node.js world to make it easy for developers to try out new ideas with feeds, figuring the easier it is, the more people will do it. Be creative. Blow our minds! :-)

## Qualcomm cancels Snapdragon Dev Kit, refunds all orders

Yes, I think it can be. For some reason people thought I'd say no. In 2003, I compiled a list of <a href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/">things that make a blog a blog</a>, and it's not about the software you use, rather it's about who's writing it, and whether they're being edited. Now it's a different question to ask if I would use it. I would not. Because it forces you to use their editor. And that's a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pernicious">pernicious</a> form of lock-in. It might sound like a small thing, but it means you can't easily try out something new. You are not available to other software developers as a possible user, so no software will be designed for you. I know how well that kind of system works. And that's probably why they lock you into using their editor. If I can't switch without breaking everything, I'm not going there.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-10-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/04/29/gecko.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Mathew Ingram <a href="https://tormentnexus.substack.com/p/is-ai-going-to-save-us-or-kill-us">asks</a> if AI will save us or kill us. It could both save and kill us. That's what's so disturbing about evolving. We live such short lives, people aren't really designed to evolve, but because of medicine and other tech, we are often forced to do it. Evolution can come many ways. Losing a job may force you to evolve. The dissolution of a marriage. Having life-saving surgery with a long recovery saves you for sure, but it might also kill you because you can't go back to being the person you were before. There might not be a path back. One thing's for sure we <i>need</i> saving. We can't survive without radical change. We're on a path that doesn't work. Is there any way for us to change radically without a complete collapse? Well, actually kind of looks like we might have been given a path out through AI. But it means we must give up control. But here's the funny thing about that. We aren't giving up anything because no one has any control. That's a political question in the US, can one person become a mad king and thus gain complete control. But he's 78 and not in good health, and that control could only last a few years at most. We will need saving from that. If somehow we could configure AI so it did what humans can't and won't do, at least our civilization might have a way forward if not our species. Just some random thoughts. Maybe unthinkable, but they occur to me anyway, which is why I have a blog.  <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-10-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/08/04/melo.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I keep writing on my hybrid <a href="https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113322998712983125">WordPress/Mastodon blog</a> at my kitchen table. This morning I wrote about why I don't believe in the Ya Gotta Believe, a baseball slogan coined by a 1973 Mets pitcher Tug McGraw. It's on-topic because the Mets are in a challenging series with the Dodgers for the National League championship. No matter how it turns out, this is a historic year for the Mets, and no matter how it turns out I won't love the Mets any less if they lose. I think true believers believe in that -- love -- without any expectations, win or lose, or maybe <i>even more</i> if they lose. BTW, I know the rendering of the post isn't complete on Mastodon, and there are errors. I'm working with the people at Automattic at getting this right. I'm glad to see that Mastodon has the flexibility to do that. Anyway, I believe in the things I believe in, not because I "gotta." I don't like the slogan because it doesn't reflect how I feel about the team. My philosophy is respectful (in a way) of the teams the Mets beat, because I understand that their fans don't love them any less because they lost. If anything I think the better slogan for the Mets would be this: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wait+till+next+year!">Wait till next year!</a> <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Minimalissimo, R.I.P.

date: 2024-10-16, from: Om Malik blog

I discovered Minimalissimo 15 years ago, literally on the day they started publishing. It became part of my RSS reader. It found a home in a folder called “The good stuff,” which had many such websites and blogs. These were aesthetics-oriented online destinations. Many of these sites are gone &#8212; becoming irrelevant with age. Others &#8230;

I thought that was both interesting and weird. I don't get how anyone I know can be a fan of the that team. An American League team in a National League city. Kind of like rooting for Staten Island. Anyway, the Yankees may win the <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2024_ALCS.shtml">ALCS</a>, but what does it mean? It's not going to make New York love them. But then Gruber is in Philadelphia so why isn't he thinking about the Phillies, who btw, the Mets beat soundly in the division series, earlier this month.

## What's up with WordPress?

date: 2024-10-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A long time ago I ran a free service <a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/faq">called</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/http://weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a>. It was the <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">early days</a> of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+weblogs.com">blogs</a>. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> didn't exist yet, so there was no way to find out which blogs had new stuff other than going through your blogroll and clicking links. </p>
<p>So I built a simple server, running in <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>, that handled pings. When you updated your blog, you'd send a message to weblogs.com saying your blog updated. It would then read the HTML of the blog and verify that it changed, and it would be added to a list of blogs that updated, in reverse chronologic order. It also published an XML version of the update list called <a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/changesXml">changes.xml</a>, so if you wanted to run a search engine off the list, you could do that too. </p>
<p>There were several ways to send a ping. You could go to a web page and enter the URL of your blog. Or you could save the URL as a bookmark and click the bookmark when you updated. Or if you used blogging software like our Manila or Radio UserLand, or later EditThisPage.com or weblogs.com (which eventually hosted blogs itself), it could ping on your behalf, automatically. </p>
<p>Aside: Here's a <a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/historyOfWeblogs">snapshot</a> of the weblogs.com site, preserved. </p>
<p>A number of search sites appeared. And we were happy, until another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technorati">developer</a>, funded by venture capitalists, who expected a return on their investment, built on our open and free <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/changes.xml">changes.xml</a> list, started asking for and receiving pings on their own, and (key point) they didn't make their change list public. This struck me as highly un-weblike and unfair, but they could do it and we had to live with it. </p>
<p>Based on what Matt has been saying it sounds to me like it's something like our experience. Except weblogs.com was a short term thing, and not a business, and it didn't last twenty years, and it didn't have a payroll to support. </p>
<p>But it still felt wrong that they weren't giving back as they received. If it had persisted like WordPress has, it would have eventually been a seriously diseconomic and unsustainable problem. And I can imagine I might write about it publicly as Matt has  and maybe even get a famous lawyer like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Katyal">Neal Katyal</a> to advise me. And here we are. </p>
<p>Have we heard anything from the other side, or anyone who is familiar with what their position might be. Do they not feel obligated to support the continued development of WordPress or maybe there's another issue we haven't heard about. </p>
<p>I can't imagine that Matt would make such a big deal out of this if it weren't actually a big deal. He probably knew in advance how disruptive this would be. And I imagine the others knew it would be too and counted on him not wanting to make a fuss. </p>
<p>I have gotten embroiled in these kinds of things in the past, and I don't like it. I love to make software and make users happy and then make more software, round and round. Anything that involves lawyers is not me doing what I was made to do. </p>
<p>And I do see a silver lining. As with twitter-like systems, I now see the possibilty to help WordPress serve writers better in the future. Before this, people didn't think change was possible in the WordPress world, like they didn't see the possibility of change with Twitter. But now Twitter has quite a bit of viable competition. I know that WordPress could be better tuned for writers, and the product has a very nice API that would make it possible for lots of writing tools to flourish. It is a strong platform that's debugged, scaled, documented and worked on for a long time, and they don't tend to break users. And where commercial vendors like Facebook and Twitter often have excellent technology, ultimately they are run by execs and bankers who don't believe in being open, where this is something that has been deeply ingrained in the WordPress culture from the beginning and would be hard to change and that's a good thing for users and developers. </p>
<p>Here's the exciting part -- between WordPress and Twitter lies a product that would bring the web back to life. Imagine a twitter-like system with the writers features of WordPress. Amazingly, we are on the cusp of that being a reality.</p>
<p>There's lots of opportunity to better serve writers here, and that's what I love to do, and honestly I think Ghost and Substack have left themselves open to a writing environment built on WordPress that doesn't try to lock users in. And at the same time, I think we can use this platform to help all the twitter-like services to support all kinds of writing, not just severely limited tweets typed into <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text boxes</a>. Somewhere along the line they got the wrong idea that taking features out of the web was a good thing. I want to bring these features back so we can get going again with the web as a writer's platform. </p>
<p>Anyway, I don't need to think anyone is right or wrong here, and I don't think anyone else should either. I think this platform is very nicely open and we can do lots of interesting new stuff here. I hope to open a new thread here, focused on writers and the web. It's been too long. </p>

## More Details on Israel Sabotaging Hezbollah Pagers and Walkie-Talkies

date: 2024-10-15, updated: 2024-10-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The <i>Washington Post</i> has a long and detailed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/05/israel-mossad-hezbollah-pagers-nasrallah/">story</a> about the operation that&#8217;s well worth reading (alternate version <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/mossad-s-pager-operation-inside-israel-s-penetration-of-hezbollah/ar-AA1rKXwe">here</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>The sales pitch came from a marketing official trusted by Hezbollah with links to Apollo. The marketing official, a woman whose identity and nationality officials declined to reveal, was a former Middle East sales representative for the Taiwanese firm who had established her own company and acquired a license to sell a line of pagers that bore the Apollo brand. Sometime in 2023, she offered Hezbollah a deal on one of the products her firm sold: the rugged and reliable AR924...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-10-15 Nuclear artificial intelligence

date: 2024-10-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-10-15-nuclear-artificial-intelligence">2024-10-15 Nuclear artificial intelligence</h1>

<p>When my wife was a kid, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened. The next year, she had leukaemia, spent months in a clean room, spent years with chemo and recovery.
Nuclear energy will always be personal.</p>

<p>Also, I grew up in two A zones and one C zone around nuclear reactors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plant has been operating since September 1969. … Beznau 2 operated under temporary licenses until 3 December 2004, when the Swiss Federal Council removed the limitation. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beznau_Nuclear_Power_Plant">Beznau</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess they just discovered it was suddenly safe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… on the Rhine and close to the border with Germany. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibstadt_Nuclear_Power_Plant">Leibstadt</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lucky how close the borders are! Half the people at risk can’t complain because they can’t vote. Strange how this seems to be a popular nuclear power plant building strategy in densely populated, fragmented political landscapes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last significant change to the KKG was the construction of a new storage facility for spent rods. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6sgen_Nuclear_Power_Plant">Gösgen</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s right. There is no solution for the spent rods for all Swiss nuclear power plants. Whenever they start digging the locals launch political movements to stop it. The solution was ingenious: now such protest must happen at the federal level, not at the local level. And this is how we’ll force that pesky radioactive waste repository on somebody. Genius.</p>

<p>I don’t even want to talk about nuclear energy vs other types of energy. Just use less fucking energy. As long as I see energy being wasted, I don’t feel like I need to accept new power plants into my life. Let alone nuclear power plants.</p>

<p>Let alone artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Nuclear energy for artificial intelligence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Google has become the latest tech giant to seek nuclear power as a source for its datacenters and other operations. … <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/google_kairos_smr_nuclear_investment/">Google hopes to spark chain reaction with nuclear energy investment</a>, by Simon Sharwood, for The Register</p>

<p>Three Mile Island, the site of worst nuclear disaster in the United States, is reopening and will exclusively sell the power to Microsoft … Microsoft will purchase the carbon-free energy produced from it to power its data centers to support artificial intelligence. …  However, nuclear has drawn criticism for environmental groups for decades for its waste. The US still has no permanent repository for that waste, instead storing it at over 70 operating and shuttered plants around the nation. – <a href="https://lite.cnn.com/2024/09/20/energy/three-mile-island-microsoft-ai/index.html">Three Mile Island is reopening and selling its power to Microsoft</a>, by Jordan Valinsky, for CNN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI winter</a>.</p>

When Italian mariner Christopher Columbus and his sailors &#8220;discovered&#8221; the &#8220;New World&#8221; for Spain&#8217;s monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492, they brought with them both ideologies and germs that would decimate the peoples living in the Americas.

## Stories help us find truth, but there’s a difference between fact and fiction

date: 2024-10-15, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Stories provide a scaffold for understanding When I read non-fiction, I&#8217;m less interested in learning facts than gaining understanding (though sometimes facts support the understanding). I want to build a mental scaffold to hook future facts and related concepts onto. I want to build a story. This connects to the &#8220;big questions&#8221; approach, which gives [&#8230;]

Ed Yong is a thoughtful guy &#8212; as he says at the end, his pillars are empathy, curiosity, and kindness. After winning the Pulitzer, he made himself rules for being a public figure online. It was interesting to hear how he related to winning the prize, which seemed to be almost embarrassment at having received [&#8230;]

## Are Kids Screenable?

Last week over coffee, a friend told me about Screenable, a new app designed to help with digital parenting.

It works on any Apple phone or iPad released in &#8230;

I've seen video of a recent press interview where Trump said he's use the military to arrest and in some cases kill Americans, starting with but not limited to Hispanics. This is not being reported in the major news orgs. We can't wait for them to fix it, we have to create new channels for news flow that have credibility and work, and we need it before the election. People need at least have a <i>chance</i> of understanding what they are voting for.

## Perfectl Malware

date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Perfectl in an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/persistent-stealthy-linux-malware-has-infected-thousands-since-2021/">impressive piece</a> of malware:</p>
<blockquote><p>The malware has been circulating since at least 2021. It gets installed by exploiting more than 20,000 common misconfigurations, a capability that may make millions of machines connected to the Internet potential targets, researchers from Aqua Security said. It can also exploit CVE-2023-33246, a vulnerability with a severity rating of 10 out of 10 that was patched last year in Apache RocketMQ, a messaging and streaming platform that&#8217;s found on many Linux machines.</p>
<p>The researchers are calling the malware Perfctl, the name of a malicious component that surreptitiously mines cryptocurrency. The unknown developers of the malware gave the process a name that combines the perf Linux monitoring tool and ctl, an abbreviation commonly used with command line tools. A signature characteristic of Perfctl is its use of process and file names that are identical or similar to those commonly found in Linux environments. The naming convention is one of the many ways the malware attempts to escape notice of infected users...</p></blockquote>

I predict I'd watch far more stuff on Netflix than I do now. Or Apple TV, Max, Hulu, Disney, etc. The idea that such a valuable resource is not part of the user experience is crazy imho. What a waste. What reminded me of this is Plex has integrated the equivalent of Bingeworthy in their service, which is also a good idea and will glue communities of users to you. The idea is to systematize recommendations. If I know a specific friend liked a movie or a show is valuable information for me, not just advertisers.

<p>Dieser Artikel ist Teil von <a href="Hellebarden_und_Helme">Hellebarden &amp; Helme</a> und eine Alternative zu <a href="2024-10-07-massengefechte">2024-10-07 Massengefechte</a>. Die Massengefechte waren etwas OD&amp;D inspiriert und sind ausführlicher, da sie für ein Fanzine geschrieben wurden.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Einheiten bilden</strong>: Gleichartigen Kreaturen werden nach belieben
eingeteilt.</p>

<p>Ein oder zwei Einheiten pro Spielerinnen und Spieler ist ein gute Anfang.</p>

<p>Trefferpunkte berechnen: Man multipliziert Anzahl Kreaturen,
Anzahl Trefferwürfel pro Kreatur und durchschnittlichen Trefferpunkten pro Trefferwürfel (4½).</p>

<p>40 Banditen haben beispielsweise 40 × 4.5 = 180 Trefferpunkte. Auf der Tabelle unten hat es viele vorberechnete Werte.</p>

<p>Initiative, Bewegung, Angriffe und so weiter funktionieren wie
immer. Rüstungsklasse, Bewegungsrate, Moral und Rettungswürfe
bleiben unverändert.</p>

<p>Im Nahkampf kann eine Einheit,
welche mit mehreren Gegnern im Kontakt ist, alle gleichzeitig angreifen!</p>

<p><strong>Gewicht</strong>: Schaden wird von Angreifer und Verteidiger nach
untenstehender Tabelle gewichtet, da in der Masse und wegen
dem Gelände nie alle gleichzeitig angreifen können: Der Schaden
wird mit dem Gewicht des Angreifers multipliziert und durch das
Gewicht des Verteidigers geteilt.</p>

<p>40 Banditen haben ein Gewicht von ×6.
Landen sie einen Treffer und würfeln
4 Schaden teilen sie 4 × 6 = 24 Schaden
aus. Ein Bandit mehr und das Gewicht
würde auf ×7 steigen.</p>

<p>Haben die Banditen mit TW 1 noch
53 Trefferpunkte, sieht man in der
Tabelle, dass es 11–20 Banditen mit
Gewicht ×5 sind.</p>

<p>Die genaue Anzahl ist im Kampf
egal. Wer es genau wissen will:
53/4.5 ≈ 12 (aufrunden).</p>

<p>Steht eine Einheit mit mehreren Gegnern im Kontakt, können
alle Gegner gleichzeitig angegriffen werden.</p>

<p>Spielercharaktere und ihr Gefolge werden von ihrer Einheit
gedeckt. Erleidet die Einheit Schaden, nehmen Spielercharaktere
und Gefolgsleute zuletzt Schaden.</p>

<p>Spielercharaktere und ihr Gefolge greifen wie immer mit eigenen
Trefferwürfen und Zaubern an. Zauber werden auf Trefferpunkte
umgerechnet. Zaubersprüche wie <em>Donnerkeil</em> oder <em>Feuerball</em>, werden
genau so gegen Einheiten verwendet.</p>

<p>Schlafen 10 Banditen mit je 1 TW
ein, so entspricht das 10 × 4.5 Schaden.
Der genaue Wirkungsbereich der
Zauber und die Marschordnung
der einzelnen Kreaturen werden
vernachlässigt.</p>

<p>Wenn eine Einheit ihr erstes Mitglied oder die Hälfte ihrer Mitglieder verliert, muss ein Moralwurf bestanden werden. Spielercharaktere verleihen ihrer Einheit den Charisma Bonus für Moralwürfe. Die Moralwürfe sind wichtig! Ist der Moralwurf misslungen,
gilt die Einheit als gebrochen. Sie weicht zurück, sucht Deckung und
hört auf zu kämpfen.</p>

<p>Spielercharaktere oder Gefolgsleute in gebrochenen Einheiten
können diesen wieder Mut zusprechen. Pro Einheit kann dies nur
eine Person pro Runde versuchen. Das Ermutigen einer Einheiten
kann jede Runde wiederholt werden. Einer ermutigten Einheit
steht ein erneuter Moralwurf zu. So oder so kann die Einheit diese
Runde sonst nichts tun.</p>

<p>Erleidet eine gebrochene Einheit erneut Schaden, flieht sie vom
Schlachtfeld. Alle weiteren Einheiten im Nahkampf erhalten einen
freien Angriff mit einem +2 Bonus.</p>
