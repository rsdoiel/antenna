date: 2024-08-04, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

The Normal Ones by A.R. Moxon It was normal to be white. It was normal to be a Christian. It was normal to be a man with a job, and it was normal to be a woman who was a man&#8217;s property. It was normal for children to be viewed as property of the parents, [&#8230;]
