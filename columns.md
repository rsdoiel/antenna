BTW, that's what <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/13/myBlogroll.png?nodialog">my blogroll</a> is turning into. My contributors. The people I keep an eye on through my work day. Where I get new ways of looking at the same world we're all looking at. We used to call this "watching them watch us watch them watching us etc."

Here's where we're headed now that we have AI programming partners. Creating software will be possible the way popular music is created. Watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">Get Back</a> to get an idea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin">George Martin</a> was the Beatles sherpa, the same way my AI partner is my guide through unknown programming lands. It now doesn't matter if I have less experience building MySQL apps than others. I have the collective experience of <i>all of them</i> here to help. My George Martin. What got me thinking about this is John Naughton's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/11/chatgpt-ai-will-co-pilot-coders-to-new-heights-of-creativity?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">piece</a> about AI and programming.

The headline in the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/05/12/pacers-blow-out-knicks-tie-series/">Daily News</a> reads "Pacers blow depleted, dead-legged Knicks out of the water in Game 4, tie series 2-2." Yeah. I don't know how we recover from this loss. In a way I imagine the Knicks issuing a resignation. "It's been a great season, but we're tired. We're headed to the beach, we'll see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support." I would nod my head and say "Yeah that makes sense." Whatever. I may spend today sleeping it off. Next game is tomorrow night. Yes, they will play, for sure, and I will watch.

## LLMs’ Data-Control Path Insecurity

date: 2024-05-13, updated: 2024-05-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Back in the 1960s, if you played a 2,600Hz tone into an AT&#38;T pay phone, you could make calls without paying. A phone hacker named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper">John Draper</a> noticed that the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/capn-crunch-whistle">plastic whistle</a> that came free in a box of Captain Crunch cereal worked to make the right sound. That became his hacker name, and everyone who knew the trick made free pay-phone calls.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of related hacks, such as faking the tones that signaled coins dropping into a pay phone and faking tones used by repair equipment. AT&#38;T could sometimes change the signaling tones, make them more complicated, or try to keep them secret. But the general class of exploit was impossible to fix because the problem was general: Data and control used the same channel. That is, the commands that told the phone switch what to do were sent along the same path as voices...</p>

## Perfect Days

date: 2024-05-13, from: Ayjay blog

The Richard Brody review of Perfect Days is a tone-deaf review by the most reliably tone-deaf reviewer out there. Every reviewer has limits to his or her catholicity of taste, because every human being is thus limited, but Brody’s cinematic sweet spot seems to be tiny, and when he doesn’t like a movie he simply [&#8230;]

## Import unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos

date: 2024-05-13, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Import unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Many years ago, I decided to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/i-made-switch-aperture-photos">migrate my photo library from Apple's now-defunct Aperture to Photos</a>, so I could take advantage of Apple's iCloud Photo Library (don't worry, I still have three full complete local backups, plus a separate cloud backup besides Apple's iCloud originals).</p>

<p>One pain point is RAW support. As camera manufacturers add new models, their proprietary RAW codecs are updated, and software vendors like Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft have to update photo editing tools to work with the new camera models.</p>

<p>I don't envy them this task, but as Photos was Apple's official successor to Aperture (a pale shadow to be sure, but it has its merits as a semi-decent library organizer), they've <em>generally</em> done well supporting new camera models. The compatibility list for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105094">macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, and iOS 17</a> is a testament to that effort.</p></div>

Every social web should offer the two same author-level moderation controls that Facebook does. 1. The author can delete comments. 2. The author can say who can respond. Here are screen shots of the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/12/whoCanComment1.png">menu</a> and <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/12/whoCanComment2.png">dialog</a>. We assume each site already has the ability to block users. No more spammer trolls.

## Did student protesters affect Biden’s decision?

date: 2024-05-12, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, This weekend, tens of thousands of students are graduating from American colleges and universities. Some graduation ceremonies have been cancelled or at least inconvenienced by student protests. Just so there&#8217;s no confusion, let me state clearly that I&#8217;m deeply opposed to Hamas. I was appalled by the atrocities it committed on October 7 that left 1,200 Israelis dead and took 134 people as hostages, including babies, children, women, and older people. And I firmly believe in Israel&#8217;s existence and its right to protect itself.

I suppose everyone projects their ideal best friend on this thing. You just learned something about me. Heh. But the cool thing is it's not a yes-person, if they think you're wrong they say so. Which I <i>really</i> like. One more thing I'm really glad I got to be alive when this stuff came online. I feel much smarter and better organized and it's harder for me to get lost in the weeds, as I do sometimes. I guess what want next is a librarian who also is a great executive assistant. Takes notes on what I'm doing and figures out what I need to be reminded of and roughly when.

## ‘Love Can Build A Bridge’

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2024/05/05/marchOnWashington.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Sometimes I just put one idea on my blog for a day and leave it at that because I think the idea is important enough on its own, and that any explanation would dilute it. Yesterday's one sentence <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their executive editor in a recent <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>, who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion leaders, to determine what they cover, that's marketing, not journalism. Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.

## 2024-05-12 What do about the climate?

date: 2024-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What do about the climate?</h1>

<p>The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way out of this uncertainty? What should or <a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?</p>

<p>Before we even start, let me just say that I&rsquo;m never interested in debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It&rsquo;s real, it&rsquo;s here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.</p>

<p>The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green, on all levels of government. And by &ldquo;green&rdquo; I mean the most radical green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a  one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something about local politics, and so on.</p>

<p>On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we&rsquo;re not sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn&rsquo;t help much against the climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean? How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The oil spills? And here&rsquo;s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop! I need to stop because there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;thinking it through&rdquo; when things are so complex unless you&rsquo;re a scientist working on it. I hope the scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and individuals know what to tackle first.</p>

<p>This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly wrong. They don&rsquo;t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also: get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are precious.</p>

<p>The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I fear.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green">@peterdutoit</a> recently posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order of impact:</p>

<p>🚫 Live car free<br>
🚙 Shift to BEV [i.e. Battery Electric Vehicle]<br>
✈️ One less flight (long return)<br>
☀️ Use renewable energy<br>
🚋 Shift to public transport<br>
🔨 Refurbishment and renovation<br>
🥗 Vegan diet<br>
🆒 Heat pump<br>
⏲️ Improved cooking equipment<br>
♨️ Renewable-based heating</p>

<li>Creutzig, F., J. Roy, P. Devine-Wright, J. Díaz-José, F.W. Geels, A. Grubler, N. Maϊzi, E. Masanet, Y. Mulugetta, C.D. Onyige, P.E. Perkins, A. Sanches-Pereira, E.U. Weber, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Chapter05.pdf">2022: Demand, services and social aspects of mitigation</a>. In <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/">IPCC, 2022: Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change</a>. Contribution of Working Group III to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [P.R. Shukla, J. Skea, R. Slade, A. Al Khourdajie, R. van Diemen, D. McCollum, M.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA. doi: 10.1017/9781009157926.007</li>
</ul>

<p>The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there&rsquo;s an answer if anybody is claiming that we don&rsquo;t know what to do. But also: there&rsquo;s your answer if you&rsquo;re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a very small number of people that have actually read this report, let alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>This is why a public &ldquo;chain of trust&rdquo; needs to lead from interviews with public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance, hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders trust in people.</p>

<p>Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a> right.</p>

<p>(We don&rsquo;t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to go.)</p>
