His response is persuasive, but there may be a way to work around it. And a hat-tip to Jeremy, he's helped us so many times getting WordLand ready to market. When you're fitting a product to another product as a platform, it's so important to get help from the vendor, and usually you don't get much of that. Much appreciated! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Tuesday

date: 2025-06-03, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

About a face. The problem Dave talks about here (my face pointlessly appearing with social media posts) is due to using an old theme that needs to be replaced. Hoping to make that happen this week. (The issue involves the &#34;featured image&#34; feature, as Dave points out in that post. When writing in Wordland, as [&#8230;]

## New Linux Vulnerabilities

date: 2025-06-03, updated: 2025-06-03, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>They&#8217;re <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/new-linux-flaws-allow-password-hash.html">interesting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tracked as <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/29/3">CVE-2025-5054 and CVE-2025-4598</a>, both vulnerabilities are race condition bugs that could enable a local attacker to obtain access to access sensitive information. Tools like Apport and systemd-coredump are designed to handle crash reporting and core dumps in Linux systems.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&#8220;This means that if a local attacker manages to induce a crash in a privileged process and quickly replaces it with another one with the same process ID that resides inside a mount and pid namespace, apport will attempt to forward the core dump (which might contain sensitive information belonging to the original, privileged process) into the namespace.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

## Generative AI and the Business Borg aesthetic

date: 2025-06-03, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

This feels like a sister piece to Ed Zitron&#8217;s essay Era of the Business Idiots and Mandy Brown&#8217;s essay Toolmen. Fair warning, this is a 5000 word post; I&#8217;ve been working on this for weeks, pulling together what I&#8217;ve learned about generative AI and culture over the past two years, so I hope it is worth [&#8230;]

I asked ChatGPT if I moved to NYC in 2009 or 2010. It answered in an instant. "You moved to NYC in 2010." I asked how it knew. It <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/02/whenIMovedToNYC.png">used my blog</a> as the source. We have <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/683da1e2-33d0-8012-a86c-d5310ac4538e">arrived</a> in the future. This is exactly the kind of query I've been begging Google to support for decades. They could have figured out where my blog is, or let me tell it where it is. Famously they once asked if I had misspelled my mother's last name in a query. How freaking clueless can you get.

In honor of the Knicks' very successful season, I temporarily put the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/27/knicksFansWithBagsOverHeads.png">paper bags fans</a> at the top of my home page as a reminder to anyone who wants to blame someone on the Knicks for how the season turned out. I think we should all wear the paper bags on our heads as a reminder of how we felt about being Knicks fans <a href="https://www.nba.com/game/ind-vs-nyk-0042400301">not all that long ago</a>. They are always a horrible team to love, whether they're playing for the title, or just trying desperately not to be the worst team in the NBA this season.

Lots of important ideas in Jay's talk. For example, the idea of developing something from one direction or the other. The problem with Bluesky and Mastodon is that they're coming from Twitter, and think they're aiming toward the web, apparently -- but they must not understand the web, because they're going to have to break with Twitter's model in <a href="https://textcasting.org/">so many ways</a> to reach the web, they'll never get there if they go slowly. If you tried to develop the social web by starting with the web, you arrive at a different place, w/o all the problems of twitter-like systems. Different problems, but not the ones the twitter model has. How do I know? Because I know. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Suggestion to WordPress devs

date: 2025-06-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Below is a screen shot of a post written by Doc Searls as viewed in Bluesky. It's jarring. The big picture of Doc gets in the way.  </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="//s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2025/06/02/docInBluesky.png"></center>Doc's post as viewed in Bluesky. His picture dominates. Imho it shouldn't.</div></p>
<p>I realize no one designed this, but it also is reality, it's how a lot of people see Doc's writing. </p>
<p>Here's my suggestion. When the user specifies a <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/featured-images/">featured image</a> for a post, set the og:image element in the head section of the page. When they don't specify such an image, omit that element. </p>
<p>That's how we did it in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/09/160323.html">Baseline theme</a>, and I, as the writer, am happy with the <a href="https://daveverse.org/">result</a>.</p>

<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/hating-new-york">Krugman is right</a>, living in NYC is amazing. When I lived in Manhattan betw 2010 and 2019, I had it great but toward the end I yearned to live in the mountains, the year before Covid hit (that was a bad time to be in Manhattan, btw). Now I yearn to again live in the city. Funny how that works. Even in the 70s I felt safe in NYC, and I commuted to school from Queens to the Bronx. It was safe enough to let a 14 year old kid ride the subway into Manhattan and up to the Bronx and back, every freaking day. I never got mugged. And I did all kinds of dangerous stuff that independent-minded teen agers do. If you can afford it, I recommend you spend some time in NYC before you believe the bullshit the Repubs say about it. They have reasons not to like the cities that have nothing to do with how nice it is. In NYC we don't trust our politicians to tell the truth. You shouldn't trust yours so much either, dear Republicans. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Your butt still stinks

date: 2025-06-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Human beings spend far to much effort feeling better than some people or feeling inferior to others.</p>
<p>This is understandable, I guess, as far as evolution is concerned, up to a point, but I think we've been past that point for a long time now. Now, evolution brought us to a point where in order to survive as a species we have to get over this need to rank people and work together.</p>
<p>So if you feel other people are better than you, get over it. Same thing if you feel better than others. You aren't and they aren't.</p>
<p>Your shit still stinks and as the great Republican philosopher Joni Ernst so eloquently put it, she's going to be dead pretty darned soon and so will you.</p>
<p>I have to remind myself of this when I see a picture of someone who is really ugly but acts like they're not. And when I say ugly, I mean ugly inside. I say to myself "Davey, they are reflecting off something inside yourself that you don't like. On a different day they might seem very beautiful to you!" So I can relax and stop worrying so much about what I think about them in the moment. It matters not one bit.</p>

## 2025-06-01 My security day

date: 2025-06-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-06-01-my-security-day">2025-06-01 My security day</h1>

<p>Made backups of three laptops and the external disk where we keep our media to one of our set of external backup disks, and took those to the office about 2 km away from where we live, exchanging them for the other set of external backup disks which we had there. One set is always outside of the house. Not sure whether that would help in an urban disaster like an earthquake or a flood, but it would at least help against a fire or a burglary.</p>

<p>And I also changed passwords because of rumours going around of a big breach.</p>

<p>Soooo… even if most of them have some sort of two factor authentication (2FA) enabled:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon ✓</li>
<li>Apple ✓</li>
<li>Google ✓</li>
<li>Discord ✓</li>
<li>Paypal ✓</li>
</ul>

<p>Paypal was definitely the worst experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your password can only include letters, numbers and these characters: !@#$%^&amp;*().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yeah? 😞</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make it longer, then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your password should be 8-20 characters long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whaaaaaaat! Are you storing it in plaintext? 😭</p>

<p>After all this shit, things reload back to the change password form … and it&rsquo;s still the old password.</p>

<p>The second time through it all seemed to work, though. I must have received half a dozen SMS with codes and two emails with codes. Ugh!</p>

Another <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/05.opml">month gone</a>, and coincidentally the end of the NBA season. I woke up this morning with the worst hangover ever, and I haven't had a drink in months (never was my vice, I have others). The Knicks lost fair and square to the Indianas last night. My first message came from NakedJen who isn't as far as I know a Mets fan, saying simply "Let's go Mets!" I like that, though it will of course take me some time to get re-adjusted. I think the Knicks were jinxed because Brunson said in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-highlight-jalen-josh-explain-why-the-yankees/id1729497779?i=1000710590814">his podcast</a> that New York has two teams, the Knicks (I agree) and the Yankees. What! No. I think we may have to consider trading him to a team without <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=philosophy">philosophy</a>. I'm not sure anyone will have him though, considering this possibly fatal flaw, philosophy-wise. And no doubt the Knicks are going to change some things over the summer, and I've heard that they might try to get <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22kevin%20durant%22">Kevin Durant</a>. I sure hope not. I think the Knicks are benefiting from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/">the jinx</a> he put on himself when he tried in vain to stir up a "rivalry" between the Knicks and the Brooklyns. No, that isn't likely to happen, unless they try to become a contender without kicking the Knicks in the butt like KD did. Maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> will want him. That's about as <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/New+York,+NY/Portland,+OR/@41.7399086,-119.4458701,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2m2!1d-74.0059728!2d40.7127753!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950b0b7da97427:0x1c36b9e6f6d18591!2m2!1d-122.6783853!2d45.515232!3e0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">far</a> from New York as you can get in the NBA. And with that I now officially shut the door on the 2024-25 NBA season. We had a great run. See you all in October! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## 2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog

date: 2025-06-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-27-alt-text-on-this-blog">2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog</h1>

<p>On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by browsers when the image cannot be shown – like text browsers or screen readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.</p>

<p>I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text should carry the entire message. “Welcome to my <a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!” 😄</p>

<p>On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients that don’t display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog, the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text isn’t shown to me – the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and front-ends don&rsquo;t just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML – they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons, mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.</p>

<p>There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don’t like these options.</p>

<p>I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown on mouse-over by default. I don’t like being forced to use mouse and I don’t like duplicating the description.</p>

<p>In Markdown:</p>

<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I still don’t like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I wouldn’t be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.</p>

<p>The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:</p>

<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy blog posts about Croatia and I’ve been checking the result using Gemini and Gopher, and I’m not happy.</p>

<p>Compare the following two with the <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a> version where I can’t read the alt text. (Screenshots from <a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)</p>

<p>The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-šibenik">Gemini</a> version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-šibenik">Gopher</a> version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don’t.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version continues to not show it.</p>

<p>Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you’re reading right now!</p>

<p>The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a> version is OK. The line-breaks don’t look nice on the phone at the default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should fix. 😅 But in general, it looks OK and reads well.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a> version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions, so ignore those extra links. 😅 The browser substitutes the filenames for the missing alt text. That works for me. I&rsquo;m not sure what a screen reader would do. Probably say: &ldquo;Image. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg&rdquo;? And I&rsquo;m not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point I&rsquo;d know that I can skip the image since I have already read the description above.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the same passage a day later, using the text browser <code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there&rsquo;s no trace of the screenshots. This is great! It&rsquo;s as readable as the Gopher version with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in the Gemini version).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I guess, they&rsquo;d just disappear.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just write more text above each image.</p>

<p>What I’m less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all images are “decorative” and therefore should have an empty alt text (instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not the text browser.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gemini">#Gemini</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gopher">#Gopher</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Markdown">#Markdown</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-05-29</strong>. I fixed that minor issue in <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/">markdown-gopher</a> so that it skips paragraphs containing just images with no alt text. 😄</p>

<p><strong>2025-05-31</strong>. I added a piece of Javascript to copy the alt text to the title attribute if the alt text is set and the title is not. Perhaps that&rsquo;ll motivate me to add more alt text.</p>

<p>This is what I added to my <code>view.html</code> template for <a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
