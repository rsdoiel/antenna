And just one for New Jersey! iLoveFood says the best pizza in Indiana is Mother Bear&#39;s here in Bloomington. Problem: it isn&#39;t. Osteria Rago&#39;s is better. Not that MB&#39;s is bad. It&#39;s good. Just not better than Osteria&#39;s. I&#39;m also betting there must be a better pizza than both somewhere in Indianapolis. iLoveFood also names top [&#8230;]

## Never in a million years...

            <p>...would I have imagined my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pz2kMxCu8I">video on whether a pigeon is faster than the Internet</a> would end up on a popular Italian quiz show, L'Eredita.

## 2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working

date: 2025-03-26, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-20-something-about-the-bot-defence-is-working">2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working</h1>

<p>At midnight, there was a surge in activity.
CPU usage went up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Load went up, too. But it stayed within reasonable bounds &ndash; less than 4 instead of the more than 80 I have seen in the past.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And the number of IP addresses blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> went from 40 to 50.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m usually sceptical of this because the big attacks are from a far wider variety of IP numbers.
In this case, however, maybe there was some probing that resulted in blocks? I don&rsquo;t know. Lucky, I guess?</p>

<p>In any case, the site is still up. Yay for small wins.</p>

<p>Also, I cannot overstate how good it feel to have some <a href="https://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> graphs available.</p>

<p><code>alex-bots</code> is a setup I desribed in <a href="2025-02-19-bots-again">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</a>.
Basically a request to one of my Oddmuse wikis containing the parameter <code>rcidonly</code> is an expensive endpoint: &ldquo;all changes for this single page&rdquo; or &ldquo;a feed for this single page&rdquo;. This is something a human would rarely access and yet it somehow the URLs landed in some dataset for AI training, I suspect. So what I do is I’m redirecting any request containing “rcidonly” in the query string to <code>/nobots</code>, warning humans not to click on these links.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the filter <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> contains this:</p>

<pre><code>[Definition]
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>

<p>And I added a section using this filter to my jail <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>

<p>So if an IP number visits three URLs containing &ldquo;rcidonly&rdquo; in an hour, they get banned for ten minutes.</p>

<p>The <code>recidive</code> filter (a standard filter you just need to activate) then makes sure that any IP number that got blocked three times gets blocked for a week.</p>

<p><strong>2025-03-20</strong>. Ever since Drew DeVault published his blog post, more people seem to notice what&rsquo;s going on: AI ingestion is killing web sites and web services.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think these crawlers respect <code>robots.txt</code> then you are several assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl everything they can find, <code>robots.txt</code> be damned, including expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit in every repo, and they do so using random User-Agents that overlap with end-users and come from tens of thousands of IP addresses – mostly residential, in unrelated subnets, each one making no more than one HTTP request over any time period we tried to measure – actively and maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user traffic and avoiding attempts to characterize their behavior or block their traffic. &ndash; <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">Please stop externalizing your costs directly into my face</a>, by Drew DeVault, for SourceHut</p>

<p>Then, yesterday morning, KDE GitLab infrastructure was overwhelmed by another AI crawler, with IPs from an Alibaba range; this caused GitLab to be temporarily inaccessible by KDE developers. I then discovered that, one week ago, an Anime girl started appearing on the GNOME GitLab instance, as the page was loaded. It turns out that it&rsquo;s the default loading page for Anubis, a proof-of-work challenger that blocks AI scrapers that are causing outages. &ndash; <a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">FOSS infrastructure is under attack by AI companies</a>, by Niccolò Venerandi, for LibreNews</p>

<p>What do SourceHut, GNOME’s GitLab, and KDE’s GitLab have in common, other than all three of them being forges? Well, it turns out all three of them have been dealing with immense amounts of traffic from “AI” scrapers, who are effectively performing DDoS attacks with such ferocity it’s bringing down the infrastructures of these major open source projects. Being open source, and thus publicly accessible, means these scrapers have unlimited access, unlike with proprietary projects. … Everything about this “AI” bubble is gross, and I can’t wait for this bubble to pop so a semblance of sanity can return to the technology world. Until the next hype train rolls into the station, of course. &ndash; <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/141969/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">FOSS infrastructure is under attack by AI companies</a>, by Thom Holwerda, for OSnews</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2025-03-22</strong>. Ordinary sysadmins get hit as well. Here&rsquo;s Sean Conner of the The Boston Diaries: He reports on <a href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/03/21">Friday, March 21, 2025</a> that his logs show a total of 468439 requests for February 2025. The top hitter was 4.231.104.62 with 43242 requests (9%). This was from MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, US. But the ASN has more networks, of course. Adding them all up give 78889 (17%).</p>

<p>He links to the <a href="https://www.team-cymru.com/ip-asn-mapping">IP to ASN Mapping Service</a> by Team Cymru. I started switching my <a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> script to using it because it also supports IPv6. Something that I haven&rsquo;t done is find the ASN and then block all the blocks belonging to the ASN. That&rsquo;s where I want to be, actually.</p>

<p><strong>2025-03-26</strong>. More media are picking it up, but with a strange focus on &ldquo;open source&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As it currently stands, both the rapid growth of AI-generated content <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-slop-is-a-brute-force-attack-on-the-algorithms-that-control-reality/">overwhelming</a> online spaces and aggressive web-crawling practices by AI firms threaten the sustainability of essential online resources. The current approach taken by some large AI companies—<a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/3292/the-pc-is-dead-its-time-to-make-computing-personal-again">extracting</a> vast amounts of data from open-source projects without clear consent or compensation—risks severely damaging the very digital ecosystem on which these AI models depend. &ndash; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/">Open Source devs say AI crawlers dominate traffic, forcing blocks on entire countries</a>, by Benj Edwards, for Ars Technica</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@bagder" title="@bagder@mastodon.social">@bagder</a> recently had some numbers:</p>

<p>The AI bots that desperately need OSS for code training, are now slowly killing OSS by overloading every site.

## Join a parade today

date: 2025-03-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This morning‘s <a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/26/join-a-parade-today/">early morning missive</a> from WordLand..</p>
<p>Talking with friends about What To Do.</p>
<p>I actually have an idea.</p>
<p>We all try to lead a parade, with a big viral idea, if only everyone would follow me, it might just work. A lot of us have that feeling. My advice — it doesn’t work. Lose it. Instead, find a parade you can join, and add your energy, talent and experience to it.</p>
<p>We have a tremendous oversupply of would-be parade leaders, we need to build momentum, and it doesn’t really matter what it is or who leads it. As long as it’s something the press can cover. A movement that begets more motion. A huge march in DC. Demonstrations at Tesla dealers. Blogging in a group. Helping an existing group route around an outage. Making a great list of causes others can join. Reading a blog and finding the thing the blogger is looking for. And so on.</p>
<p>There’s great satisfaction in joining a righteous cause that’s working, my bother, my sister.</p>
<p>This goes back to something observed in standards work. The standard is set by the person who goes second, not the one who goes first. The person who chooses to interop instead of blazing a new incompatible trail. We should celebrate people who support others as much as we do the one who goes first. You need both, and the thirds and fourth adopters to create a movement.</p>
<p>At a time like now when there’s no room for error or individual ego, as Ben Franklin’s so wisely said during America’s revolution, we must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.</p>
<p>PS: One way facebook can cripple a nascent movement, by the algorithm not showing you parades you might like too much. Remember Zuck is trying to ingratiate himself to trump. I find I’m seeing posts of vital interest to me over 24 hours after they were posted, when 165 people have already liked it. Suspicious behavior. We need to own our own social net. </p>
<p>PPS: This philosophy led me to build on WordPress as a foundation, instead of building my own, which I am fully capable of. It’s working much better this way, so far. Could the be a way toward our own social net? Possibly.</p>

## Doc's approach to WordLand

date: 2025-03-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Watching Doc Searls use WordLand to post to his <a href="https://doc.searls.com/">WordPress blog</a>. </p>
<p>He's using it the way <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.4100j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Manila</a> worked for blogging in the late 90s early 00s. Every day is a new page, which contained as many items as you liked. When you add a blank line that starts a new post. It's Markdown kind of a approach to structuring text. </p>
<p>There's a point where you click the <i>Flip Home Page</i> button. You can do that once a day. Each day is a fresh start. Each day gets its own archive page. The software can automate some of that, but it's trivial to do it by hand. A nice daily ritual. </p>
<p>The RSS feed we generated looked for two Returns in the text, that started a new &lt;item>.</p>
<p>Manila eventually adopted Blogger's approach, but I always liked this way because it said a blog post can be a very small thing. That was certainly the way I write. Some ideas don't require a lot of writing, so why should they take up so much space? I'm trying to make sure that as WordLand evolves, it treats little things and big things with equal respect. </p>
<p>Basically Doc is doing manually what Manila did for you, but it's not a lot of work, he just clicks the + icon to create a new post, when he wants a fresh start. He has to choose a site from a popup, and then he's ready to write. The advantage is he has them all arrayed for him to make a change where ever he likes. I have that when I write in Drummer. </p>
<p>He's not getting the benefit of the RSS treatment in Manila. Both WordPress and WordLand see that as one post, not N posts. </p>
<p>Below is a screen shot of Docs blog, and below it, in contrast is a page generated by Manila in 2001.</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/26/docsBlogScreen.png"></center>A screen shot of a <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/25/there-they-go/">day</a> in the life of Doc's new blog.</div></p>

## AI Data Poisoning

date: 2025-03-26, updated: 2025-03-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Cloudflare has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/cloudflare-turns-ai-against-itself-with-endless-maze-of-irrelevant-facts/">new feature</a>&#8212;available to free users as well&#8212;that uses AI to generate random pages to feed to AI web crawlers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of simply blocking bots, Cloudflare&#8217;s new system lures them into a &#8220;maze&#8221; of realistic-looking but irrelevant pages, wasting the crawler&#8217;s computing resources. The approach is a notable shift from the standard block-and-defend strategy used by most website protection services. Cloudflare says blocking bots sometimes backfires because it alerts the crawler&#8217;s operators that they&#8217;ve been detected.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we detect unauthorized crawling, rather than blocking the request, we will link to a series of AI-generated pages that are convincing enough to entice a crawler to traverse them,&#8221; writes Cloudflare. &#8220;But while real looking, this content is not actually the content of the site we are protecting, so the crawler wastes time and resources.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

<p>Griechisches Blaukissen<br>

<p>I thought chaenomeles was always red, but I guess not.
Here it is again.</p>

<p>Not sure what this is. Some sort of prunus?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-21-blumen-22.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The contrast between those trees and the road construction works is poignant.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/02/28/presidentCarter.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">This may seem controversial, but the Repubs do have a point re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion">DEI</a>. We really do have a problem honoring the achievements of white men. I know because I get the bullshit when people have tried to honor me for my achievements. When I was offered a keynote spot a the <a href="https://isoj.org/symposia/2019/">ISOJ conference in 2019</a>, to honor my (then) 25 years of blogging, I told the show runner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosental_Alves">Rosental Alves</a>,  that his audience wouldn't like me. He is gentle generous person, so I believe he was genuinely puzzled. I decided to go, because a future of journalism conference that thinks the advent of blogs was something for journalists and journalism students to acknowledge was something I wanted to see. But in the Q&A period, it all came out. Bluntly and rudely. My contributions mean nothing because I am a white man and in their minds I couldn't have failed. Do they really believe that? Swimming upstream isn't easy for anyone. The experience at that conference was pretty good proof of that. Behind my back in Silicon Valley, while I was writing about the failures along with the victories, when professional journalists and magazine publishers almost unconditionally worshipped the tech gods, I assume because they respect money more than anything, I wrote about the great victories of tech, but a lot of them didn't come from billionaires and VCs. I don't study the creativity of bankers, I care about tools for creative <i>people.</i> I tried to write the truth, didn't always succeed and sometimes I had to retract. But I did pretty much what journalism preaches. Stayed true to what I believe. The "white men bad" thing was an excuse for people to say I was weak or stupid, or whatever they think. So we get the backlash now. Some of the energy that MAGA gets is honest frustration of people who are victims of DEI, despite the hype from "the woke" which is a term I despise, what's wrong with being awake, what's the alternative, being asleep? dead? -- these righteous assholes, on both sides of this thing, really do treat people as objects, and that hurts, and that kind of pain is hard to forget.

<li><strong>Introducing Paragon Solutions.</strong> Paragon Solutions was founded in Israel in 2019 and sells spyware called Graphite. The company differentiates itself by claiming it has safeguards to prevent the kinds of spyware abuses that NSO Group and other vendors are notorious for.
<li><strong>Infrastructure Analysis of Paragon Spyware.</strong> Based on a tip from a collaborator, we mapped out server infrastructure that we attribute to Paragon&#8217;s Graphite spyware tool. We identified a subset of suspected Paragon deployments, including in Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Israel, and Singapore.

I live in a place now with a score of zero, you can't do anything without a car. I moved from a place with a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/score/301-w-57th-st-new-york-ny-10019">score</a> of 99. I'd like to have social networks get a score like that, for how much they feed energy into the open web, vs how much they take out. Something that attracts you from the open web, uses it to build its network, but doesn't reciprocate, gets a low score. Like Twitter or Facebook, they'd have a lot of nerve saying they were of the web, and thankfully they don't. But Bluesky? They would like you to believe they are of the web, that they are feeding the web, when they are not. They would get Twitter's score, divided by two for the dishonesty. Substack? They don't make the claim so they're bad for the web but not the worst. Mastodon? They're trying. But they could make a concerted effort to check the boxes on <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>, and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs).

A thought for everyone struggling to see a good future in all the michegas. My advice -- please -- do your protesting, resisting, DEIing, organizing, learning, and look for silver linings (they are there) and most important keep doing things that feed your soul. Treat yourself with love even if the world isn't. So in that spirit for those of us who love cats -- a <a href="https://prisonjournalismproject.org/2024/10/23/cats-came-to-my-california-prison/">story</a>.

I want natural language text macros in ChatGPT. I would devise a macro that turned random text I wrote online into a properly formatted blog post. for example when i write fast i almost never stop to capitalize things that should be capitalized. or i might abbreviate the name of a product so i expect it to fill it in, as a professional copy editor would. I hope we're heading there. And if they have this, put it behind a simple api so i can wire it into my favorite writing tool. We could even work on a set of standards, a higher level Markdown if you will, that goes deeper than formatting. That would be something for an experienced copy editor to do imho.

We're getting into WordPress in a new way, the need for a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/64">featured image</a> came from users. I didn't know they had this feature in WordPress. If you asked me if it did, I would have said yes, I'm sure it does, but where and what is it called? i could've gotten that too via chatgpt, but i would have had to think of it. that's where having sharp users makes a world of difference. When people thank me for my generosity, they don't get it. I want something out of it, your experience and your mind. It's one of my main raw materials.

I've been putting Markdown support in my feeds -- everywhere -- on both sides, yielding <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/23/markdownSerendipity.png">serendipity like this</a>. This is how "it just works" comes about. With a good <a href="https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000">design</a> and a lot of love.

## When profit trumps principles

date: 2025-03-23, from: Tracy Durnell Blog
