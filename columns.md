## Happy Birthday, MetaFilter!

date: 2024-07-14, from: Matt Haughey blog

<p>It&apos;s pretty incredible that <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">MetaFilter</a> turns 25 years old today. Barely anything on the internet sticks around for this long. </p><p>MetaFilter predates LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube. It&apos;s older than Wikipedia and Blogger. Other similar sites sprang up after it like Digg, then reddit, then Quora, but</p>

## 2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux

date: 2024-07-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-14-yvonand-tour-du-vallon-des-vaux">2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux</h1>

<p>On the last day, we decided to go for a walk nearby instead of getting on the train immediately.
We took the train to Yvonand and turned towards the hills, spending most of our time in the forest.
This is <a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/route-129">route 129</a>.</p>

<p>When leaving the fields around Yvonand and entering the woods, the autobahn arches high above.
If only it were a fantastic train and not a triumph for car culture.</p>

<p>This small rivulet must have cut the canyon.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This bridge marks the beginning of the way up, if I remember.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you leave the forest, you&rsquo;re on the plateau above.
We ate lunch at the Hotel de Ville in Chavannes-le-Chêne.</p>

<p>Gewöhnliche Wegwarte<br>
Cichorium intybus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s a weird one from the night before: Apparently the square in front of the castle is bathed in blue light at night, as if a train station bathroom trying to keep drug addicts away.</p>

<p>Somewhat creepy.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/shownotes/podcast0/2024/07/14/anInterviewInAPodcast.html">shownotes</a> for today's <a href="https://this.how/podcast0/">Podcast0</a> episode. The shownotes pages now have a player. Still have a little more work to do on it. I like this because it's a lightweight project, which is something I need while the world is boiling over.

## Morning coffee notes

date: 2024-07-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>BTW, I'm intermittently locked out of my <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa">Threads</a> account. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png">They say</a> it has to do with automated stuff they don't explain. I don't have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network, it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don't see me over there, this is why.</p>
<p>How I found out about Trump's assassination. By accident, I was watching CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to season 6 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty">Line of Duty</a>, which isn't very great. I couldn't focus on the show. I got my iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting that <i>he</i> hadn't been killed, and somehow I knew that "he" was Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his fist, looking right into the camera. He's 100 percent television actor. Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn't cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed killing him. He's thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies about being a victim, really is a victim, and we'll never hear the end of it. And it didn't take long before a random Republican asshole was saying this was Biden's fault for saying Trump would end democracy, which he has said he will, promised to do, and <i>we saw him try to do it</i> on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides. It didn't take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate. This was Biden's fault they all agree. Occam's Razor says this is over. We aren't going to vote in November. The deal is done because the journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I've yet to hear another explanation from them.</p>
<p>If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph, they'd nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That's how our journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the dictator. This is what it's like after that happened. People inside big companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize. Now their malaise becomes ours. </p>
<p>BTW, if Biden steps aside don't expect the Repubs won't sue saying it's illegal, so guess what -- not only don't you get Biden, you don't even get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the arguments already written.</p>

## The Rite of Spring

date: 2024-07-14, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

This is on my bucket list to see performed live, but the closeup shots in this are fun to see how different sounds are produced. I love watching the musicians get into it &#8212; the bass player was really going to town. The coordination of dozens of people to play complex music together is one [&#8230;]

As Maine writer E. B. White famously wrote to a man who said he had lost faith in humanity: &#8220;Hang on to your hat. Hang on to your hope. And wind the clock, for tomorrow is another day.&#8221; I&#8217;ll see you all then. &#8212; Notes: https://thesidingspring.com/2016/07/14/a-letter-from-e-b-white/

## Today's violence

date: 2024-07-14, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, My first thought on hearing about the attempted shooting of Donald Trump at a rally today in Pennsylvania was &#8220;I hope to god he&#8217;s okay.&#8221; I thought this for the usual reasons we human beings hope that other humans are safe from harm. But I had another reason in the case of Donald Trump.
