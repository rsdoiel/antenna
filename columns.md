**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-11-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/14/strongman.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;"><a href="https://lists.opml.org/">lists.opml.org</a>: The other day I asked a famous blogger who uses RSS if he would be willing to share his list of feeds, so others could subscribe to them. He declined, for good reason, there was private stuff in the list he couldn't share. I certainly understand that. Then I realized, as often is the case, that I could do myself what I had been asking others to do. And in fact I already was sharing my OPML subscription lists, but people who didn't use <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> wouldn't know <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/04/whereTheOpmlLinkIsInFeedland.png">how to find</a> them. So I decided to make it easier. On <a href="https://lists.opml.org/">lists.opml.org</a> I've got a link to the <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/podcasts.opml">lists of podcasts</a> I'm subscribed to. That list should update every hour for any additions or removals from this list. I don't update the list very often, fwiw. And I make no warranties about the quality of the podcasts, or when the feeds in the list update. And maybe this will give other people an idea that they might want to do this as well. Let me know if you do, I'd love to see what you do.

We need great turnout this year, record-setting turnout, as a show of love for our country and our Constitution. Vote now, because later you might not have any power to change direction. Tomorrow, you do have power. And remember that voting is not you expressing yourself, it's not free speech, it's you and I governing. This is our moment of greatest power. Use it or lose it.

## Rebooting the news

date: 2024-11-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>My opinion: At this point it doesn’t matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.</p>
<p>After the election if we still have freedom of speech, we should reboot news around the simple idea of news written by experts. They must know the basic rules of journalism, imho that's much easier than the know-nothing journalist posing as everyman with a <a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">view from nowhere</a>, trying to understand what they're writing about. They don't have any basis to judge, we give them far too much power. That system is rooted in a time when publishing was expensive but that hasn't been true for thirty years. the old system has run its course. This election, either way, is a lesson in how that system, if it ever worked, doesn't work today. The next news system will be sources going direct to interested readers. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen">Jay Rosen</a> and I did a <a href="https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/">series of podcasts</a> in the early teens called Rebooting the News. This was the basic premise. I believe more than ever that this is the best path for news going forward. </p>
<p>They did this at Wired for a while. I was invited to be a columnist when my main qualification was that I was an accomplished software developer. I think that's the way to go. Experts sharing their perspectives on current events. </p>
<p>Before Twitter existed, in 2002, I proposed to the NYT that they offer a blog to anyone who is quoted in a NYT article. If they had done this, the NYT would be what Twitter became, and it wouldn't now be owned by Elon Musk, for the benefit of humanity. I wish they had done it. It would have been a real moneymaker. And good for the flow of knowledge.</p>

<p>So I decided I wanted to gzip the PDF files (&ldquo;pre-compress&rdquo;) them.
I found the answer I was looking for in <a href="https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/serving-pre-compressed-files-using/">Serving pre-compressed files using Apache</a> by François Marier.
Sometimes searching for stuff is hard just because you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s called. 😅</p>

<pre><code>AddEncoding gzip gz
Options +Multiviews
SetEnv force-no-vary
Header set Cache-Control &quot;private&quot;
&lt;FilesMatch &quot;\.pdf\.gz$&quot;&gt;
ForceType application/pdf
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>OK, time to gzip them all!</p>

<pre><code>for d in 2*; cd /home/alex/campaignwiki.org/1pdc/$d; echo $d; gzip *.pdf; end
</code></pre>

<p>Aaaaand … the gains are abysmal! 😓</p>

<p>The PDFs really are that big! 🤨</p>

<p>Somebody should put a size limit on submissions!</p>

<p>The whole collection is still 4.4G. 😞</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RPG">#RPG</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%231PDC">#1PDC</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-11-04</strong>. I started looking at Ghostscript to reduce filesize.
The result using <code>-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook</code> is disappointing. The first PDF I opened had text in the original turned to a badly pixelated image.</p>

<p>I started reading <a href="https://ghostscript.com/blog/optimizing-pdfs.html">Optimizing PDFs</a> on the Ghostscript blog and my head started smoking.</p>

<p>I ended up writing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="1pdc/markdown-links">markdown-links</a> to turn the filenames into Markdown links for the wiki page</li>
<li><a href="1pdc/zip-original">zip-original</a> to create the first zip file of the originals</li>
<li><a href="1pdc/shrink-pdfs">shrink-pdfs</a> to shrink all the PDFs using <code>pdf-shrink</code></li>
<li><a href="1pdc/pdf-shrink">pdf-shrink</a> reduce the images in a PDF files to 150dpi (ebook quality)</li>
<li><a href="1pdc/zip-dir">zip-dir</a> to create the zip file of the shrunk files for upload</li>
<li><a href="1pdc/upload-dir">upload-dir</a> to upload the files to the site itself</li>
</ul>

<p>To this, <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@mxp" title="@mxp@mastodon.acm.org">@mxp</a> replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My invocation is less elaborate (w/o the threshold, filter settings, etc.), but similar in that I also downsample images to 150 dpi. In addition, I have <code>-dSubsetFonts=true -dCompressFonts=true</code>, but since I use this for my own LaTeX-generated documents, I guess I could drop this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t look into fonts because I don&rsquo;t mind people using weird fonts; for the moment images are a bigger problem than fonts.</p>

<p>Then I went through my local directories and called <code>pdf-shrink</code> on them all, regenerated the zip file containing the year&rsquo;s entries and gzipped the individual files.</p>

<p>As I was going through the files for 2024 I noticed that sometimes the filenames betray different names (from email senders, I presume), leaking privacy related information. I wanted to make sure that the filenames reflected the authors of the works and that made me realize two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>not every entry has the license URL clearly visible</li>
<li>not every entry has the author names clearly visible</li>
</ol>

<p>Then again, anonymous works are OK, but it would have saved me some time if it said &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; somewhere. 😏</p>

<p>In any case, if you publish PDF files somewhere, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m planning to do from here on out:</p>

<ol>
<li>add copyright information and the license (if any), i.e. a date or at least a year and the names of all the people that have rights to the work (text, art, layout, editing, maps, and so on)</li>
<li>add the work&rsquo;s title and the names of the all the people to the PDF&rsquo;s metadata (&ldquo;properties&rdquo;)</li>
<li>put the work&rsquo;s title, data or version and the name of the main author (your name?) into the filename</li>
</ol>

They're trying to estimate what millions of people will do by talking with a few hundred. So they read each others' work, and try not to be too far off the consensus. It's at best an art, at worst they're just press releases designed to get the ad money to flow in certain directions. Don't overlook that the money is flowing to the same businesses that are choosing which polls to report on. Most of what the news orgs report on, it makes it into a sport like the NBA or MLB, but there at least there's objective news to report on, you know -- the score of each game, how many runs were scored, who got injured, fired, traded. In politics, there is no objective news, and if there were, the journalists we have don't report it. There's a lot of inputs that are connected to the outputs, conflicts of interest everywhere. Even so, the <a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/241102/p54#a241102p54">top item</a> on <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/03/iowapoll.png">Memeorandum</a> is about a <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/">poll in Iowa</a> that says Harris is ahead. Iowa was never thought to be in play. Yes, I too am addicted. Endlessly fascinated. Maybe we'll survive next week after all? Hope.

## Could a Musk buy Bluesky?

date: 2024-11-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast">Cory Doctorow</a>: "I will never again devote my energies to building up an audience on a platform whose management can sever my relationship to that audience at will." It's a good practice, and while I completely support it, I am part of several communities that could remove me without recourse. I do it because I value the people in the community, and feel that life is too short to wait for everyone to get it right. </p>
<p>Doctorow was writing about Bluesky, and once again, on Bluesky a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7ygxnh7ce2a">discussion</a> starts on what it would take for Bluesky to attract developers, and each time I am told that they have done enough, and I go away thinking that their pitch is a scam, and they're building value in a user base that they will sell. They certainly could do it, and for all we know the founders may have already sold some of their stock in the <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a">latest investment round</a> which valued the company at $x billion. (I did a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bluesky+investment+round+%2415m">search</a> to find the evaluation but it appears to have not been announced.) </p>
<p>I gave them a roadmap, again, of how to demonstrate that they're open, and finally <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7zvw43d752a">concluded</a> that the only way to <i>really</i> do it is to "provide a download that you can install on any popular operating system to get an instant blue sky network, running on its own without any help from anyone else. Then you can claim to be really open and until then there will be a lot of confusion." (And I was generous at that. More accurately, people with experience in tech will be certain this is yet another deal where the founders get rich, where the users are the product and have read too much into their promise of being open.) </p>
<p>I'm still on Bluesky but I expect them to be another Twitter, which btw had an open API too, and it's pretty good, but they never offered the option of people running their own twitters. That would have been good protection against a Musk buying them out and turning us into pawns in his plan for world domination. Do we really want to help someone else build one of those? </p>
<p>In early 2017 I <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">observed</a> that Twitter had just been used to route around journalism and elect a president. This value wasn't on their balance sheet as an asset. I felt its stock was vastly underpriced. Exactly as it turned out when Musk bought it. Everyone still thinks he paid too much, at this moment it could possibly gain him control of part of the US government's $6 trillion per year budget early next year, and if they start selling the assets of the government he could be in the best position to buy them at pennies on the dollar, or take a percentage of each saleAt this point it doesn’t matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.. He could probably start borrowing against it the day after the election is called for Trump.</p>
<p>In the title I ask if a Musk could buy Bluesky, it's possible they have a way to prevent that in the design of their corporation, that's why it's a question. But if the price were right maybe the founders would sell out even if they didn't have to. </p>
