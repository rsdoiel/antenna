## Hearing on the Federal Government and AI

date: 2025-06-06, updated: 2025-06-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>On Thursday I testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform at a hearing titled &#8220;<a href="https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/the-federal-government-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/">The Federal Government in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other speakers mostly talked about how cool AI was&#8212;and sometimes about how cool their own company was&#8212;but I was asked by the Democrats to specifically talk about DOGE and the risks of exfiltrating our data from government agencies and feeding it into AIs.</p>
<p>My written testimony is <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Schneier-Written-Testimony.pdf">here</a>. Video of the hearing is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKkk-uWi7HM">here</a>.</p>

## Fediforum report

date: 2025-06-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>This was an email I sent to one of the people I'm working with at Automattic, and realized I was actually writing a blog post. </i></p>
<p>I was watching on the FediForum session yesterday, and heard all this stuff about Bluesky and Mastodon, but these are products that are poorly prepared for the "open social web" -- and imho they won't get there. But WordPress is already there. </p>
<p>I think some of the products are good, btw -- I hadn't seen Surf, it's basically a feed aggregator that can get input from Bluesky and Mastodon. I don't think they're using their RSS support though. Not adequate. But WordPress RSS is fine. I made an improvement to the Scripting News RSS to add an &lt;image> element that works like the one on a WordPress site. Now my posts can show up in the timeline via RSS. </p>
<p>That's the key to what we're doing. Reading and writing, with the UI of a twitter-like product, all built on RSS, with the content also appearing on the network WordPress has defined. I see this as huge. </p>
<p>Obviously this needs to be a blog post. </p>

I think I might recognize some of the applications based on the scripting functionality we developed in apps on the Mac and Windows in the 90s with <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. Today I might have one of the largest public codebases written by one human that hasn't yet been touched by an AI. Maybe it could be some kind of artifact from ancient times? Like, last week?

## Report on the Malicious Uses of AI

date: 2025-06-06, updated: 2025-06-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>OpenAI just <a href="https://openai.com/global-affairs/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-june-2025/">published</a> its annual report on malicious uses of AI.</p>
<blockquote><p>By using AI as a force multiplier for our expert investigative teams, in the three months since our last report we’ve been able to detect, disrupt and expose abusive activity including social engineering, cyber espionage, deceptive employment schemes, covert influence operations and scams. </p>
<p>These operations originated in many parts of the world, acted in many different ways, and focused on many different targets. A significant number appeared to originate in China: Four of the 10 cases in this report, spanning social engineering, covert influence operations and cyber threats, likely had a Chinese origin. But we’ve disrupted abuses from many other countries too: this report includes case studies of a likely task scam from Cambodia, comment spamming apparently from the Philippines, covert influence attempts potentially linked with Russia and Iran, and deceptive employment schemes...</p></blockquote>

## Sipeed NanoCluster fits 7-node Pi cluster in 6cm

date: 2025-06-06, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Sipeed NanoCluster fits 7-node Pi cluster in 6cm</span>

            <p></p>

<p>Sipeed's <a href="https://sipeed.com/nanocluster">NanoCluster</a> is a tiny compute module clusterboard with room for up to 7 tiny computers.</p>

<p>Each slot has two inline M.2 (NGFF) slots which accept either a custom-designed SoM (System on Module) or an adapter board to adapt a standard Compute Module form-factor board into the slot (as pictured above).</p>

<p>One end has a large fan for cooling, and the other end has power and IO. You can power the board via either PoE++ (60W) or through USB-C PD (65W). Or <em>both</em>, with redundant power fail-over.</p>

## Presenting the Shady Characters Periodic Table of Emoji

date: 2025-06-06, from: Shady Characters blog

<p>I have made a thing! Head over to <a href="https://emoji.shadycharacters.co.uk">emoji.shadycharacters.co.uk</a> to peruse the <cite>Shady Characters</cite> Periodic Table of Emoji.</p>
<p>What do I mean by a periodic table of emoji? Well, I answer that question in some detail <a href="https://emoji.shadycharacters.co.uk/#what">in the notes under the table itself</a>, but briefly, I wanted to see if I could use a table to tell us something about how emoji are perceived. Which emoji are positive? Which are negative? Which ones convey sentiments that match their appearances, and which deviate from them?</p><a class="more-link" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2025/06/periodic-table-of-emoji/">Read more →</a>

## 2025-06-05 Oddμ history

date: 2025-06-05, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-06-05-oddμ-history">2025-06-05 Oddμ history</h1>

<p>On fedi, <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@reidrac" title="@reidrac@mastodon.gamedev.place">@reidrac</a> mentioned that Oddμ doesn&rsquo;t keep a page history. The idea is that the wiki is only accessible to a small circle of trusted people and therefore we don&rsquo;t need a history to fight spam and vandalism.</p>

<p>Some people like backups so that they can go back in time, however. One could run a cron job once a day that does a snapshot using <code>rsync</code>. For my local copy of the wiki I use a Makefile with a target for that:</p>

<pre><code>SHELL=/usr/bin/fish

download:
	rsync --archive --exclude '*~' --delete --itemize-changes sibirocobombus:alexschroeder.ch/wiki/ .

diff:
	rsync --dry-run --archive --exclude '*~' --delete --itemize-changes . sibirocobombus:alexschroeder.ch/wiki/

upload:
	rsync --archive --exclude '*~' --delete --itemize-changes . sibirocobombus:alexschroeder.ch/wiki/

snapshot:
	rsync --link-dest ../wiki --archive . ../wiki-(date --iso-8601)/
</code></pre>

<p>I run <code>make snapshot</code> in a directory called <code>wiki</code>. The command syncs all the files from the current directory to a directory containing the current date, e.g. <code>../wiki-2025-06-05</code> and in order to save space, unchanged files are simply hard-linked to the file in <code>../wiki</code>, i.e. the current directory. If I edit files using an editor, the original is renamed and a new copy is created. Therefore, the hard-linked snapshots retain their content.</p>

<p>One could clean up older snapshots with a cron job and just keep the last week, for example.</p>

<p>If people need access to the old copies, one would do this via the web server and serve the snapshot directories as static files.</p>

<p>If one wanted an even more traditional &ldquo;no forgiving nor forgetting&rdquo; system, there&rsquo;s always a version control system like <code>git</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch?tab=readme-ov-file#gitwatch">gitwatch.sh</a> is a shell script that can watch a directory using <code>inotifywait</code>. When it detects changes, it waits for a few seconds and then adds and commits any changes.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jw0k/gwatch">gwatch</a> is a program written in C that does the same thing.</p>

<p>Access to the git repository is a different problem, now: One could have a cron job run <code>git push</code> every now and then and people access the repository elsewhere. Or one could use something like <code>cgit</code> to serve a read-only copy of old revisions.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Now a personal comment. What pisses me off most about Bluesky is the political environment all this is happening in. We <i>need</i> an open social web. They've got a lot of people convinced they are it. They are not and they know it. And they keep leading people on. They should either deliver, now, or get out of the way.

Why don't people, esp journalists, call them out on this? We've been around this loop over and over in tech. There's a virtual conference today, FediForum, that on their <a href="https://fediforum.org/">home page</a> repeats <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/05/promises.png">the hype</a>. Why do people do this? What's the point of pouring your time into technology you hope someday will be open? I bought a ticket to the conference so if there are any sessions that look like they might be productive I can participate. I even wrote a <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/04/162206.html">keynote</a>, so you can see there is a way for this stuff to start working, quickly, if the vendors you're looking up to are sincere in their promises. I've posted it on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114630925085003307">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lqufhhswis2r">Bluesky</a> so if you have comments or questions, we can start the discussion now, or any time.

## Can David Frum hear me?

date: 2025-06-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I've been enjoying the new <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/the-david-frum-show/">David Frum podcast</a>. He's very good at thinking and does a lot of it, and expresses himself very well. I read all his columns and have read two of his books, even though I don't share much of his pre-Trump politics, I find it interesting to hear how he parses things. I also subscribe to The Atlantic. I listen to him. But in this week's episode it's clear that the listening is one-way. </p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-showwhy-are-the-media-so-afraid-of-trump/683029/">episode</a> we heard from the elite journalist David Frum, interviewing elite editor in chief Marty Barrett, formerly of the Washington Post, and they both make what I believe are wildly inaccurate generalizations about the quality of the news reporting by professionals and the ugliness and inadequacy of bloggers and podcasters. </p>
<p>The problem is, they don't read widely enough to know that there are bloggers and podcasters with good intentions, ethics, deep knowledge and experience who are also well educated -- they don't know we exist and therefore can't hear about the huge mistakes they are making with their own self-perception of their role that we can see because we are not in their world. (BTW, I have been in their world, I was a contributing editor at Wired, a research fellow at Harvard and NYU, each for two years, and I have collided with Frum-like elites, the usual response is a hand-wave of dismissal, written off as not worth listening to, I guess.)</p>
<p>Frum, at the end of the episode talks about how the press covered Biden's incapacity, that led to the second Trump term. They should have stopped, once we were all informed of what happened, and let the <i>electorate</i> decide, it wasn't up to them, or the celebrities they gave space to in their op-eds. In the United States, the <i>people</i> decide. Instead they put up a roadblock and wouldn't let the issue drop. We all knew, we were all informed, probably long before we read a single article about his debate performance. They should have stopped. That was their malpractice. </p>
<p>Their responsibility was to give us the information, and it was also their responsibility to stop right there. Once informed, they were wrong in continuing to harp on it. </p>
<p>We saw them do it with Governor Cuomo of New York. And Senator Al Franken. And Donald McNeil at the NY Times. And on and on. There's so much reporting that's lazy and incompetent, but they'll never report on that, because of their conflicts. And they never listen to their critics. And as a result they play a role they are not entitled to play.  </p>
<p>They need to wake up to the idea that while reporting from their bubble is still important and is heard, they misuse it regularly, and we are fed up with it. If they want to control the government, do the right thing, and run for office. Don't do it from your byline in the Washington Post or NY Times. </p>

## My keynote for FediForum

date: 2025-06-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://fediforum.org/">FediForum</a> is a virtual conference that starts on June 5. If they had asked me to keynote, this is roughly what I would say. </p>
<p>Imho this stuff is pretty freaking simple, esp since there are well over 20 years of prior art to use, and not that many ways to do what we're trying to do. I'm impatient, so here's a quick set of observations with my opinion, take it for what it's worth, ymmv, etc. </p>
<ul>
<li>You shouldn't be reinventing so much. Always look around for <a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod">prior art</a>. That will make it possible for you to interop more quickly at both a software level and at a human level. </li>
<li>Don't invent stuff you think you may need later. Save that for later. You have no intuition for what's needed and more important nothing to test against. You will get it wrong 100 percent of the time.</li>
<li>Don't invent stuff you think you may need later that makes what you're doing now more complicated. I see a lot of that in ActivityPub.  </li>
<li>The only reason you're doing all this work is for interop. If you've been doing it for years and you don't have much meaningful interop you're doing it wrong.</li>
<li>Write the software first. Use formats that exist, or if you must invent new stuff, make sure it's simple. Work on its simplicity as you would any other feature. Factor! If there are going to be 100 interoperable products and you make it a little more difficult to implement, that work will be multiplied 100 times. And it be a barrier to entry, so you may not get the most powerful interop possible with the most interesting products. </li>
<li>Read and follow the <a href="https://this.how/standards/">Rules for Standards-makers</a>. There aren't that many. But if you're breaking them, you're not going to end up with a standard. If your goal is to appear to be making standards, you should also read RFSM, and don't do anything in it. I've seen people do that btw. </li>
<li>Have you looked at the world outside the tech stuff to see how important this all has become? All the time we're wasting is very costly in everything that depends on the social web actually existing as opposed to just being talked about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, what would I request if I could influence you??</p>
<ul>
<li>Mastodon and Bluesky should support inbound and outbound RSS, and do it really well. Right now they do outbound only, and the implementations are incomplete at covering the functionality they have now, and there needs to be more (see the next item). </li>
<li>They'd support the basic features of the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> spec, including Markdown because it's a great standard, very much of the same school as RSS. If it had existed when we did RSS 2.0 it would have been part of it. </li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. Really not much work. </p>
<p>From there we'd have 25 years of interop to explore. </p>
<p>And we could really call this the open social web.</p>
<p>I'm ready to do it any time you all are. </p>
<p>Yours in not wasting time.</p>
<p>Dave</p>
<p>PS: I asked ChatGPT to <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/04/talkVisualized.png">visualize</a> me giving this talk.</p>
<p>PPS: Comments or questions on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114630925085003307">Masto</a> or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lqufhhswis2r">Bluesky</a>.</p>

This required me to go through some very old code that my system still depends on. It's remarkable how much time this seemingly small feature took to implement. One of these days I have to move this code to one of my more modern servers. One reason it took so long is that a random package that does something that never changes, had a breaking change in it. The breakage culture of the Node.js world is just plain fucked up, no other word for it.

Or the Pakistanis with Indian air bases? Or the North Koreans with South Korean air bases? Militaries that thought they had secured their air bases with electrified fences and guard posts will now have to reckon with the threat from the skies posed by cheap, ubiquitous drones that can be easily modified for military use. This will necessitate a massive investment in counter-drone systems. Money spent on conventional manned weapons systems increasingly looks to be as wasted as spending on the cavalry in the 1930s...</p></blockquote>

I heard that about an hour before the Knicks fired their coach. I don't think it's good or bad, it could work out great. No one knows if this was The Season the Knicks were meant to go to the Finals, but if it was, maybe next year will be too? There's no right answer. Maybe this was Dolan's call. I hope not.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If you followed the Knicks through the playoffs as I did, I recommend the latest <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/indianas-incredible-finals-run-a-knicks-summer/id1043699613?i=1000710778336">episode</a> of the Bill Simmons podcast. It began with talk about the fan base and that got me thinking. We don't know what would happen if the Knicks were in the Finals. Honestly. It could be the antidote to the crazyness. Maybe the reason things are so fucked up is that it's been 52 freaking years since the Knicks won the title. Something happens every so often, the energy field around the Knicks shifts -- Patrick Ewing, Melo, Linsanity and now Brunson. It'd be interesting to map that out against events in the world at the corresponding times. We won't find out this year. In the same way I sensed that New Orleans was doomed when I went to school there, I have a strong feeling connecting the Knicks to something not sure what, but it feels big.

<p>They&#8217;re <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/new-linux-flaws-allow-password-hash.html">interesting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tracked as <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/29/3">CVE-2025-5054 and CVE-2025-4598</a>, both vulnerabilities are race condition bugs that could enable a local attacker to obtain access to access sensitive information. Tools like Apport and systemd-coredump are designed to handle crash reporting and core dumps in Linux systems.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&#8220;This means that if a local attacker manages to induce a crash in a privileged process and quickly replaces it with another one with the same process ID that resides inside a mount and pid namespace, apport will attempt to forward the core dump (which might contain sensitive information belonging to the original, privileged process) into the namespace.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

## Generative AI and the Business Borg aesthetic

date: 2025-06-03, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

This feels like a sister piece to Ed Zitron&#8217;s essay Era of the Business Idiots and Mandy Brown&#8217;s essay Toolmen. Fair warning, this is a 5000 word post; I&#8217;ve been working on this for weeks, pulling together what I&#8217;ve learned about generative AI and culture over the past two years, so I hope it is worth [&#8230;]

It <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/02/whenIMovedToNYC.png">used my blog</a> as the source. We have <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/683da1e2-33d0-8012-a86c-d5310ac4538e">arrived</a> in the future. This is exactly the kind of query I've been begging Google to support for decades. They could have figured out where my blog is, or let me tell it where it is. Famously they once asked if I had misspelled my mother's last name in a query. How freaking clueless can you get.

I think we should all wear the paper bags on our heads as a reminder of how we felt about being Knicks fans <a href="https://www.nba.com/game/ind-vs-nyk-0042400301">not all that long ago</a>. They are always a horrible team to love, whether they're playing for the title, or just trying desperately not to be the worst team in the NBA this season.

Lots of important ideas in Jay's talk. For example, the idea of developing something from one direction or the other. The problem with Bluesky and Mastodon is that they're coming from Twitter, and think they're aiming toward the web, apparently -- but they must not understand the web, because they're going to have to break with Twitter's model in <a href="https://textcasting.org/">so many ways</a> to reach the web, they'll never get there if they go slowly. If you tried to develop the social web by starting with the web, you arrive at a different place, w/o all the problems of twitter-like systems. Different problems, but not the ones the twitter model has. How do I know? Because I know. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Suggestion to WordPress devs

date: 2025-06-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Below is a screen shot of a post written by Doc Searls as viewed in Bluesky. It's jarring. The big picture of Doc gets in the way.  </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="//s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2025/06/02/docInBluesky.png"></center>Doc's post as viewed in Bluesky. His picture dominates. Imho it shouldn't.</div></p>
<p>I realize no one designed this, but it also is reality, it's how a lot of people see Doc's writing. </p>
<p>Here's my suggestion. When the user specifies a <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/featured-images/">featured image</a> for a post, set the og:image element in the head section of the page. When they don't specify such an image, omit that element. </p>
<p>That's how we did it in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/09/160323.html">Baseline theme</a>, and I, as the writer, am happy with the <a href="https://daveverse.org/">result</a>.</p>

<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/hating-new-york">Krugman is right</a>, living in NYC is amazing. When I lived in Manhattan betw 2010 and 2019, I had it great but toward the end I yearned to live in the mountains, the year before Covid hit (that was a bad time to be in Manhattan, btw). Now I yearn to again live in the city. Funny how that works. Even in the 70s I felt safe in NYC, and I commuted to school from Queens to the Bronx. It was safe enough to let a 14 year old kid ride the subway into Manhattan and up to the Bronx and back, every freaking day. I never got mugged. And I did all kinds of dangerous stuff that independent-minded teen agers do. If you can afford it, I recommend you spend some time in NYC before you believe the bullshit the Repubs say about it. They have reasons not to like the cities that have nothing to do with how nice it is. In NYC we don't trust our politicians to tell the truth. You shouldn't trust yours so much either, dear Republicans. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Your butt still stinks

date: 2025-06-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Human beings spend far to much effort feeling better than some people or feeling inferior to others.</p>
<p>This is understandable, I guess, as far as evolution is concerned, up to a point, but I think we've been past that point for a long time now. Now, evolution brought us to a point where in order to survive as a species we have to get over this need to rank people and work together.</p>
<p>So if you feel other people are better than you, get over it. Same thing if you feel better than others. You aren't and they aren't.</p>
<p>Your shit still stinks and as the great Republican philosopher Joni Ernst so eloquently put it, she's going to be dead pretty darned soon and so will you.</p>
<p>I have to remind myself of this when I see a picture of someone who is really ugly but acts like they're not. And when I say ugly, I mean ugly inside. I say to myself "Davey, they are reflecting off something inside yourself that you don't like. On a different day they might seem very beautiful to you!" So I can relax and stop worrying so much about what I think about them in the moment. It matters not one bit.</p>

## 2025-06-01 My security day

date: 2025-06-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-06-01-my-security-day">2025-06-01 My security day</h1>

<p>Made backups of three laptops and the external disk where we keep our media to one of our set of external backup disks, and took those to the office about 2 km away from where we live, exchanging them for the other set of external backup disks which we had there. One set is always outside of the house. Not sure whether that would help in an urban disaster like an earthquake or a flood, but it would at least help against a fire or a burglary.</p>

<p>And I also changed passwords because of rumours going around of a big breach.</p>

<p>Soooo… even if most of them have some sort of two factor authentication (2FA) enabled:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon ✓</li>
<li>Apple ✓</li>
<li>Google ✓</li>
<li>Discord ✓</li>
<li>Paypal ✓</li>
</ul>

<p>Paypal was definitely the worst experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your password can only include letters, numbers and these characters: !@#$%^&amp;*().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yeah? 😞</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make it longer, then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your password should be 8-20 characters long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whaaaaaaat! Are you storing it in plaintext? 😭</p>

<p>After all this shit, things reload back to the change password form … and it&rsquo;s still the old password.</p>

<p>The second time through it all seemed to work, though. I must have received half a dozen SMS with codes and two emails with codes. Ugh!</p>

Another <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/05.opml">month gone</a>, and coincidentally the end of the NBA season. I woke up this morning with the worst hangover ever, and I haven't had a drink in months (never was my vice, I have others). The Knicks lost fair and square to the Indianas last night. My first message came from NakedJen who isn't as far as I know a Mets fan, saying simply "Let's go Mets!" I like that, though it will of course take me some time to get re-adjusted. I think the Knicks were jinxed because Brunson said in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-highlight-jalen-josh-explain-why-the-yankees/id1729497779?i=1000710590814">his podcast</a> that New York has two teams, the Knicks (I agree) and the Yankees. What! No. I think we may have to consider trading him to a team without <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=philosophy">philosophy</a>. I'm not sure anyone will have him though, considering this possibly fatal flaw, philosophy-wise. And no doubt the Knicks are going to change some things over the summer, and I've heard that they might try to get <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22kevin%20durant%22">Kevin Durant</a>. I sure hope not. I think the Knicks are benefiting from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/">the jinx</a> he put on himself when he tried in vain to stir up a "rivalry" between the Knicks and the Brooklyns. No, that isn't likely to happen, unless they try to become a contender without kicking the Knicks in the butt like KD did. Maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> will want him. That's about as <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/New+York,+NY/Portland,+OR/@41.7399086,-119.4458701,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2m2!1d-74.0059728!2d40.7127753!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950b0b7da97427:0x1c36b9e6f6d18591!2m2!1d-122.6783853!2d45.515232!3e0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">far</a> from New York as you can get in the NBA. And with that I now officially shut the door on the 2024-25 NBA season. We had a great run. See you all in October! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

<p>On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by browsers when the image cannot be shown – like text browsers or screen readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.</p>

<p>I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text should carry the entire message. “Welcome to my <a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!” 😄</p>

<p>On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients that don’t display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog, the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text isn’t shown to me – the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and front-ends don&rsquo;t just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML – they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons, mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.</p>

<p>There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don’t like these options.</p>

<p>I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown on mouse-over by default. I don’t like being forced to use mouse and I don’t like duplicating the description.</p>

<p>In Markdown:</p>

<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I still don’t like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I wouldn’t be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.</p>

<p>The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:</p>

<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy blog posts about Croatia and I’ve been checking the result using Gemini and Gopher, and I’m not happy.</p>

<p>Compare the following two with the <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a> version where I can’t read the alt text. (Screenshots from <a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)</p>

<p>The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-šibenik">Gemini</a> version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-šibenik">Gopher</a> version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don’t.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version continues to not show it.</p>

<p>Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you’re reading right now!</p>

<p>The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a> version is OK. The line-breaks don’t look nice on the phone at the default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should fix. 😅 But in general, it looks OK and reads well.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a> version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions, so ignore those extra links. 😅 The browser substitutes the filenames for the missing alt text. That works for me. I&rsquo;m not sure what a screen reader would do. Probably say: &ldquo;Image. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg&rdquo;? And I&rsquo;m not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point I&rsquo;d know that I can skip the image since I have already read the description above.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the same passage a day later, using the text browser <code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there&rsquo;s no trace of the screenshots. This is great! It&rsquo;s as readable as the Gopher version with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in the Gemini version).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I guess, they&rsquo;d just disappear.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just write more text above each image.</p>

<p>What I’m less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all images are “decorative” and therefore should have an empty alt text (instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not the text browser.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p><strong>2025-05-29</strong>. I fixed that minor issue in <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/">markdown-gopher</a> so that it skips paragraphs containing just images with no alt text. 😄</p>

<p><strong>2025-05-31</strong>. I added a piece of Javascript to copy the alt text to the title attribute if the alt text is set and the title is not. Perhaps that&rsquo;ll motivate me to add more alt text.</p>

<p>This is what I added to my <code>view.html</code> template for <a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
