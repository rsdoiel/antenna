## Why Does Biological Evolution Work? A Minimal Model for Biological Evolution and Other Adaptive Processes

And, for that matter, why does machine learning work? Both are examples of adaptive processes that surprise us with what they manage to achieve. So what’s the essence of what’s going on?

## The soundtrack of your life

date: 2024-05-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I've developed new appreciation for two musicians from my generation: George Harrison and Bob Dylan, thanks to the encouragement of two friends, both of whom have links to my childhood believe it or not, but who are current friends in my <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dotage">dotage</a> and they're both on Facebook. </p>
<p>So my first friend said she likes <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison">George Harrison</a> the best of all the Beatles, and I thought that's weird because it really was down to Paul and John, I thought -- and then I heard this interview with George asking why he didn't explain in his memoir how he worshipped John as a kid, and George took exception, saying yeah in John's mind that's who I am, a kid who worshipped him, which I never did (says George). So now I have gone back through his music and see holy shit he really was as unique as either of the others, and he was more of a collaborator in his later life than either (of course we never got to find out how John would have evolved past 1980). And he was never going to be taken seriously by the others, so he had to get out of there to have the creative life he wanted. </p>
<p>About Dylan, the credit goes to my local friend and <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/song-173-all-along-the-watchtower-part-one-hes-not-the-messiah/">Andrew Hickey</a>, who focused my attention on the <i>music</i> of Dylan's songs, when I had only been focusing on the lyrics. Silly of me. He only ever wanted to be seen as a musician, not a leader of anything, and that's where the difficulty came from, and why I wasn't really interested, even though I had listened to all the Dylan songs many times, and had a few of his albums growing up. So I just played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangled_Up_in_Blue">Tangled Up in Blue</a> and realized this has been rolling around in my mind for days, and I wasn't even aware of it.</p>
<p>Kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower">All Along the Watchtower</a> (another Dylan song) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar Galactica</a>, which I just heard is currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-1/dp/B000UU2YKE">on Amazon</a>. I think it's time for another binge of that. ;-)</p>
<p>Anyway, two doors open, and that's always good. You know this is why you pick your music when you're young and stay with it, because it's the soundtrack of your life, and it has new relevance at every step of your evolution. Sure I listen to other music, but -- it's the songs that were big when I was little that matter most. </p>

A number of people have asked me for my thoughts about the current university campus protests. I have very few.

I think the Repubs learned something after one of their own boasted that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/02/kristi-noem-response-dog-killing">she killed her own dog</a> with a gun. They learned that Republican voters think the right to bear arms does not make them hate dogs and to their surprise <i>they don't endorse shooting them.</i> Maybe shooting Jews, immigrants, people of color and libruls and libtards of all flavors would probably be okay but for crying out loud not dogs!! They're so freaking cute.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-05-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW, there are plenty of relatively low priced <a href="https://www.stubhub.com/indiana-pacers-indianapolis-tickets-5-10-2024/event/152902691/?quantity=2">tickets available</a> at the Pacers arena for the May 10 game when the playoff heads to Indiana. This is one of the Knicks fans' favorite tactics. Since there are so many New Yorkers, spread out all over the country, and we're pretty much all Knicks fans, this can create a demoralizing effect for the opposition players who assume their hometown crowd will be rooting for them, not the other team. It had a pretty adverse effect on the Sixers a few days ago. I was chatting about this with fellow Knicks fan <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=NakedJen">NakedJen</a> during last night's harrowing game, and said this might be a good tactic somehow in the election, if every time the opposition had a rally they discovered that most of the attendees were actually in favor of democracy and abortion rights.

Almost all playoff series that aren't sweeps are intense, but this one was especially so. So we're on to the <a href="https://fox59.com/sports/pacers/schedule-released-for-pacers-knicks-playoff-series/">next round</a>, starting Monday, back in NYC, against the Indiana Pacers, an excellent team this year. And Doc Searls, who is also a Knicks fan, now lives in Indiana, so he is somewhat justified in believing the world revolves around him. I've always had that sense about Doc.

Bryan Garsten:  Liberal societies, I want to suggest, are those that offer refuge from the very people they empower.

## My T-group in Big Sur, 1969

date: 2024-05-03, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, From time to time, I share with you some of my personal history so that you understand where my values come from. The late 1960s was a time of experimentation &#8212; &#8220;sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll&#8221; and a lot more. The giant baby-boom generation was heading out into the world that seemed to many of us to be nuts. Some of us joined cults. Others, urban communes. Others, utopian communities in the countryside.

## What became of 1999.io

date: 2024-05-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>TL;DR: It's gone -- you can't get <a href="http://1999.io/">there</a>. Because it uses Twitter for identity. It and bingeworthy.io are the two apps I miss the most. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io">1999 was a rewrite</a> of blogging software from the point of view of both 1999 and 2016. Both timeframes. I had learned a lot inbetween, and the art of online interaction had moved forward a lot. I had become a user of Facebook, and was impressed with how their software worked. I was imploring them to turn it into a blogging system, it was achingly close. When I realized they weren't going to do it, I set out to do it myself, how I imagined Facebook would do a blogging system. Of course I didn't have their source code, so I built it from scratch. </p>
<p>Because 1999 used Twitter for identity, I couldn't use it. I also couldn't use Radio, because it ran on Windows and a now-obsolete version of the Mac OS. It's made me think that maybe in a few years or even months you might not be able to use <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> or <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>. Then I thought about how I can better future-safe them for users. And that led me to adding a simple feature to FeedLand that will help if a FeedLand server you depend on should go off the air. See the next post, below.</p>

## Protecting your FeedLand subscription lists

date: 2024-05-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First and foremost, you should keep a current backup copy of your subscription list. It's very easy to do. </p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>, choose <i>My feed list</i> in the first menu.</li>
<li>Click on the white-on-orange XML icon, in the upper right corner of the page.</li>
<li>That will open a standard OPML version of your subscription list. This is the format that all feed reading software understands. </li>
<li>In your browser, choose the <i>Save Page As</i> command in the File menu (or something like that, there are lots of browsers) and save it along with your other backups.</li>
<li>You can also automate it if you can run a script that gets stuff over the internet. Once a night would be fine, not a huge burden on the server. </li>
</ul>
<p>I added another way to preserve your feed list, using localStorage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time you sign in FeedLand now saves a copy of your subscription list in localStorage. </li>
<li>And if the FeedLand server you're using should happen to disappear, if you have not taken a backup in a while, if you have a tab open, you'll at least have a copy in localStorage. </li>
<li>If you want to see it -- visit feedland.org or feedland.com, wherever you have an account, and do a hard reload. Then open the JavaScript console, and enter this line:</li>
<ul>
<li><code>console.log (localStorage.savedUserSubs)</code></li>
</ul>
<li>If you have questions, here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/240">thread</a>.</li>
</ul>

## On mistaking a transient state for a permanent one

## The UK Bans Default Passwords

<p>The UK is the first country to <a href="https://therecord.media/united-kingdom-bans-defalt-passwords-iot-devices">ban default passwords</a> on IoT devices.</p>

## Lawless Trump demands law and order on campuses

Friends, Trump yesterday urged college presidents to be tougher on students protesting the war in Gaza, calling them &#8220;raging lunatics.&#8221; He continued: &#8220;To every college president, I say remove the encampments immediately. Vanquish the radicals and take back our campuses for all of the normal students.&#8221;

## 2024-04-22 Gopher, again

date: 2024-05-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-22-gopher-again">2024-04-22 Gopher, again</h1>

<p>Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> using a version of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>, the Gemini server I’m using, based on renderer code I found in the <a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a> that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Oddµ, I figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable Gopher pages.</p>

<p>It took some wrangling and it’s probably not great, but the main menu matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site is back as a gopher hole on port 70!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git">patched Satellite</a> for the Gemini server code, <a href="2023-11-03-other-ports">discussed back in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>And naturally I’m immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in this client I’m using.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gopher">#Gopher</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-01</strong>. I think I finally managed to get decent word-wrapping!</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-02</strong>. I think I&rsquo;m fine with the limitations I&rsquo;ve set myself for the Markdown Gopher server. It really leans into the plain text aesthetic.</p>

## How “AI” is helping my writing process

People often talk about how AI will kill us, and take our jobs.&#160; It may do all that, but for now, I think of it as technology that augments my capabilities, and I see this play out every day in my life as a writer. For instance, yesterday I interviewed Matthew Prince, co-founder of CloudFlare. &#8230;

## 4-way NVMe RAID comes to Raspberry Pi 5

<p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/radxas-sata-hat-makes-compact-pi-5-nas">Penta SATA HAT</a> I tested last month, this carrier uses thinner and faster NVMe storage, making it a highly-compact storage expansion option, which has the added benefit of freeing up the top of the Pi 5 for other HAT expansion options.</p>

My father taught me how to organize my thinking when I was trying to figure out how something works. And that's basically what I've spent my life on, figuring out how things work. The most interesting and gratifying was understanding things that didn't exist until I pieced their story together.

When I log on to meta.ai, <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/01/suggestions.png">these</a> are the suggestions. None of them relate to things I'm thinking about. I haven't been a student or interviewed for a job in decades. But I've been on Facebook for many years, and I had to connect this to my Facebook account to use it, so presumably it knows all that Facebook knows about me, about me.

If you're a blogger, here's something to think about. Whose writing influenced the way you write? Here's my list: Kurt Vonnegut, My uncle Ken (not his writing, rather his way of telling stories), my father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker">Russell Baker</a>, Robert Hunter (lyricist for the Dead), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland">Douglas Coupland</a> (specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs">MicroSerfs</a>), the Suck.com guys, everyone who was writing at Hotwired in 1995. I'll think of others, but those are the ones who come to mind. I have been a constant reader since I was a little kid, so there's a mix of writing styles from authors I don't immediately remember. I should also do one of these lists for who inspired my software.

It felt like the Knicks had won the game when Maxie single-handedly pulled the Sixers back into contention. Now the Knicks are up 3-2 with the next game in Philadelphia tomorrow night. But! I didn't flip out this time like I did for the last game, and I think it was because I was able to watch it on <a href="https://www.msgnetworks.com/">local TV</a> with the familiar play by play guy, Mike Breen, and the best color guy for any sport, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+clyde+frazier">Walt Clyde Frazier</a>. If he wasn't flipping out why should I. One of the things I love about his <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=clydisms">narration</a> is that he uses words incorrectly, kind of like <a href="https://thelastdrivein.com/2015/07/02/the-archie-bunker-malapropism-dictionary-of-mangled-english/">Archie Bunker</a>. I keep wanting to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means">say</a> "I do not think it means what you think it means," but then I realized, last night, for the first time, it's freaking poetry! A lot of it even rhymes. And it's a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do. Unfortunately I don't think the MSG crew is going to be doing the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=nba+schedule&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;">next game</a>. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN. Maybe it's because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It's all totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend asked, if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan">owner</a> of the Knicks wasn't a putz. I said of course, he's the worst but, the Knicks now are being well managed. So maybe he's mellowed out a bit?

The Five Spot, on St. Mark&#8217;s Place in Manhattan, hosted most of the great jazz musicians of the middle part of the twentieth century — Charles Mingus, for instance: It was also a block-and-a-half from 77 St. Mark&#8217;s Place, which is where for a long time Auden lived for about half of each year.

## The 50th Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop

For a crew of volunteers to keep a small, invitation-only, off-the-record workshop going for half a century is an amazing achievement. A lot of the credit goes to the late <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/11/john-wharton-rip.html">John H. Wharton</a>, who chaired it from 1985 to 2017 with one missing year. He was responsible for the current format, and the eclecticism of the program's topics.<br />
<br />
Brian Berg has written a short history of the workshop for the IEEE entitled <a href="https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/events/asilomar-microcomputer-workshop"><i>The Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop: Its Origin Story, and Beyond</i></a>. It was started by "Three Freds and a Ted" and one of the Freds, Fred Coury has also written about it in <a href="https://amw.org/a-short-history-of-amw-by-fred-coury/">here</a>.Six years ago David Laws wrote <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-asilomar-microcomputer-workshop-and-the-billion-dollar-toilet-seat/"><i>The Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop and the Billion Dollar Toilet Seat</i></a> for the Computer History Museum.<br />
<br />
I have attended almost all of them since 1987. I have been part of the volunteer crew for many, including this one, and have served on the board of the 501C3 behind the workshop for some years.<br />
<br />
This year's <a href="https://amw.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prog24.pdf">program</a> featured a keynote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Patt">Yale Patt</a>, and a session from four of his ex-students, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shebanow">Michael Shebanow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen-mei_Hwu">Wen-mei Hwu</a>, <a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf">Onur Mutlu</a> and Wen-Ti Liu. Other talks came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvy_Ray_Smith">Alvy Ray Smith</a> based on his book <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1163953124"><i>A Biography of the Pixel</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lou_Jepsen">Mary Lou Jepsen</a> on <a href="openwater.health">OpenWater</a>, her attempt to cost-reduce diagnosis and treatment, and Brandon Holland and Jaden Cohen, two high-school students on applying AI to the Prisoner's Dilemma. I interviewed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Malachowsky">Chris Malachowsky</a> about the history of <a href="https://nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a>. And, as always, the RATS (Rich Asilomar Tradition Session) in which almost everyone gives a 10-minute talk lasted past midnight.<br />
<br />
The workshop is strictly off-the-record unless the speaker publishes it elsewhere, so I can't discuss the content of the talks.<br />

## It's different after its gone

date: 2024-04-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>Note: This post is the summary of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/30/weNeedMoreChange.m4a">podcast</a>. </i></p>
<p>When my mother died in 2018, it didn't settle in that the context in which I lived, my whole life, was gone. </p>
<p>She lived in the house I was raised in. Very little had changed in that house. I hadn't lived there since I went away to college, but it still defined who I was, an adult who didn't live in his childhood home. When we sold the house, the last time I saw it, it was empty, and that was when it hit me. That part of my life is over. I no longer have a home I can return to.</p>
<p>The same is true with our understanding of who we are as adult American citizens. Until now we felt we had a vote. But that is over, unless we change our view of the country we live in. It's not that it's about to change, which is what you hear in the news, and on social web -- <i>it has already changed. </i></p>
<p>We now understand that Trump may be above the law but that masks a bigger truth, the Supreme Court is already above the law. They take bribes, openly. They cannot be prosecuted (just try it and see what happens). They openly side with the insurrection, yet don't recuse when deciding issues of what to do with the insurrectionists. They imagine the president is a monarch. </p>
<p>We're already living in the authoritarian state we're worried about. We haven't caught up with that reality yet. </p>
<p>Our government is more concerned about our right to own guns than it is with our right to own our own bodies. Stop for a moment and let that sink in. If I said you don't own your own body, what would you think I'm talking about? Answer: Slavery. </p>
<p>If we did catch up with that reality, we would start organizing now to undo that mistake. We would not only re-elect Biden in a landslide, but we'd insist that he expand the court to 100 members serving 10-year terms each, retroactive. And thus we would eliminate one of the huge problems in our system of government. Have they proved they need this kind of correction? Yes, the overturning of Roe, and the lack of prosecution of Trump for trying to overthrow the government are all the proof we need. </p>
<p>And from then-on, no politician in any branch of government would take us for granted.</p>

Friends, Republicans are attacking Biden for expanding the federal debt, and the House &#8220;Freedom Caucus&#8221; is livid that Speaker Mike Johnson has agreed to more funds for Ukraine, claiming it will expand the debt even further. Can we just have some sanity here?

They play the game exactly as it should be played. And they don't take the bait to make it about anything other than what happens on the court, and to trust in the league to take care of players who don't play by the rules. And <i>of course</i> the Philadelphia arena was full of Knicks fans. The tickets cost a lot less than NYC tickets, and it's only 2 hours away by car, and there's good train service. If the series goes back to Philadelphia, the same thing will happen. I feel sorry for fans of small town teams, because no matter where you go in the US, there are always lots of Knicks fans. Largest city in the country.

## Whale Song Code

date: 2024-04-29, updated: 2024-04-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>During the Cold War, the US Navy tried to make a <a href="https://www.twz.com/8778/the-u-s-navy-tried-to-turn-whale-songs-into-secret-code">secret code</a> out of whale song.</p>
<blockquote><p>The basic plan was to develop coded messages from recordings of whales, dolphins, sea lions, and seals. The submarine would broadcast the noises and a computer&#8212;the Combo Signal Recognizer (CSR)&#8212;would detect the specific patterns and decode them on the other end. In theory, this idea was relatively simple. As work progressed, the Navy found a number of complicated problems to overcome, the bulk of which centered on the authenticity of the code itself.</p>
<p>The message structure couldn&#8217;t just substitute the moaning of a whale or a crying seal for As and Bs or even whole words. In addition, the sounds Navy technicians recorded between 1959 and 1965 all had natural background noise. With the technology available, it would have been hard to scrub that out. Repeated blasts of the same sounds with identical extra noise would stand out to even untrained sonar operators...</p></blockquote>

## Thoughts on Cosmotechnics

date: 2024-04-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>A fine post by Ethan Marcotte called <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-negotiation-cycle/"><em>The negotiation cycle</em></a> led me to an incredible essay by Alan Jacobs called <a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/from-tech-critique-to-ways-of-living"><em>From Tech Critique to Ways of Living</em></a>. It references an old idea called “The SCT<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>” which is new to me but based on thinking by the likes of Ursula Franklin and Neil Postman who I am familiar with. Neil Postman’s <em>Technopoly</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> –which I read in March– was one of the best books on technology I’ve ever read, so this is relevant for me.</p>
<p>Jacobs’ essay takes an unexpected yet welcome turn towards Daoism linking to a heavier essay by Yuk Hui called <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/"><em>Cosmotechnics and Cosmopolitics</em></a>. I’m not smart enough to fully understand all these philosophical (epistemological?) arguments<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>, but reading the word “cosmotechnics” felt like a beacon in the night for a concept I’ve intuitively felt but never had a word to describe. In Hui’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me give you a preliminary definition of cosmotechnics: it is the unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities, whether craft-making or art-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that science and technology are moral. Try as we may to divorce a tool from an outcome, there is always an interplay. As a contrived example, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component and it would by itself be morally neutral. But if I make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that someone with a disability cannot use, then I have made a moral decision through either action or inaction. Similarly, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that puts a stuffed animal in a digital shopping cart, that is morally neutral. But if that stuffed animal is knowingly assembled with child labor and dropshipped from afar with an immense carbon cost relative to the value of the item, I have made an immoral <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code>. It’s not hard for me to imagine that someone somewhere is making a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component that launches a nuclear missile…</p>
<p>In the words of Dr. King from his sermon <em><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/">The Three Evils of Society</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided missiles and misguided men.”<br />
– Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you believe technology is moral, then the next larger follow up question is “Whose morals?”</p>
<hr />
<p>This question of “Whose morals?” permeates my thoughts, specifically in regards to global challenges like climate change. Call me unpatriotic, but I don’t think rugged American individualism is going to manifest destiny our way out of the climate crisis. A technological breakthrough seems unlikely. We need to rely on the knowledge and experiences of African, Asian, and Indigenous societies who have a different ontology, a different Dao (a code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural order); one that prioritizes the group over the individual. In less metaphysical terms, I believe we need to listen to societies built on cooperation and sharing of limited resources over societies built on the continuous expansion of dominion through exploitation of markets, labor, and people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need a new language of cosmopolitics to elaborate this new world order that goes beyond a single hegemon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>I agree with Hui that a singular perspective cannot and will not solve the current crisis we are facing. Technology alone will not save us. We need scientific power in the hands of moral-powered men and women. And the longer we wait the more we risk erasing the communities and ancient knowledge we need to find an equitable solution.</p>
<hr />
<p>Climate change, geopolitical conflict, the rise of authoritarianism brought about by social media companies… these are all large problems that take governments decades to solve. That puts cosmotechnics far away from me, a would-be practitioner. Hui thankfully provides a story from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">Zhuangzi</a></em>; the butcher Pao Ding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pao Ding is excellent at butchering cows. He claims that the key to being a good butcher doesn’t lie in mastering certain skills, but rather in comprehending the Dao. Replying to a question from Duke Wen Huei about the Dao of butchering cows, Pao Ding points out that having a good knife is not necessarily enough; it is more important to understand the Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter into the gaps between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of web development I like. It agrees with me. I better understand the <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao of web design</a>. Our apps and websites are like water, flowing in and out of viewports. Contextualizing themselves to the recipient’s limitations or preferences. Those who find the easier paths through the gaps become excellent butchers of websites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pao Ding adds that a good butcher has to change his knife once a year because he cuts through tendons, while a bad butcher has to change his knife every month because he cuts through bones. Pao Ding, on the other hand—an <em>excellent</em> butcher—has not changed his knife in nineteen years, and it looks as if it has just been sharpened with a whetstone. Whenever Pao Ding encounters any difficulty, he slows down the knife and gropes for the right place to move further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another translation I read phrased the bad butcher as “hacking” through bones and what a serviceable metaphor we’ve found! The knife, a technology. The medium, a cow or software. Our tools will last longer if we learn how to slow down and understand the nature of the medium, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">the grain</a>, rather than hacking against it.</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of capitalism and keeping up with the zeitgeist makes this hard. There’s a pressure to keep up, lest you fall off the cliff of irrelevance. After all, technology always only advances and there’s always a better knife in the distance… right?</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve heard myself referred to as a “curmudgeon”, “old guard”, “gatekeeper”, and “dinosaur”. That is due in part to my loudmouthed punditry but also because I dislike a specific technology from an <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">immoral company</a> that does our industry, society, and users irreparable harm. Moving fast and rethinking best practices spawned untold lifetimes worth of human hours dedicated to knife swapping each year. And when tools dull, we throw stones at each other.</p>
<p>I’ve always been overly cautious and considered in the tools I use but I’ve never thought of the tools I use as  a moral choice. Perhaps now I will. I’m not a Daoist by any means, but this idea of <em>cosmotechnics</em> begins to provide a mental framework for expressing the relationship between technology and morality. From the large scale of the cosmos to the small scale of the knife, I’m glad to have vocabulary to think about future problems.</p>

<p>My library’s copy of <em>Technoloply</em> had a copyright date of 2012. A ten year old book being so relevant to me in 2024 was impressive. But that was the reprint date!

<p>One nuanced point I disagree with Hui on is on who should hold the leading power in this new cosmopolitical system. I fully agree we need to grow out of our single hegemony (America), but I’ve heard this “multipolar world’ philosophy echoed by Vladimir Putin before and I don’t believe we should cede moral authority over to authoritarian regimes that slaughter and demonize LGBTQ+ groups and ethnic minorities. We shouldn’t use new technology to reinstate old Cold War era superpowers of oppression. We need something entirely new. That said, I sit in a comfortable seat of privilege and systemic power well within the borders of the American Empire… <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

## more rational choices

date: 2024-04-28, from: Ayjay blog

My recent posts on how I choose what fiction to read and what’s going on with the publishing industry share a theme: perverse incentives. (Indeed, it seems that a lot of my writing is about perverse incentives, but more about that another time.) The intellectual/political monoculture of the modern university leads to an intellectual/political monoculture [&#8230;]

## Retribution and forgiveness

date: 2024-04-28, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

War or Nothing by A. R. Moxon I reckon this was the first lesson of a war-oriented society that we are all learning. Old what&#8217;s-his-name knew, with the sage wisdom of somebody living in a war-oriented society; when you are attacked, war is not optional. Killing is not only an appropriate answer to killing, it [&#8230;]

## Brief thoughts on the wave of campus protests across America

date: 2024-04-28, from: Robert Reich's blog

Let&#8217;s be clear about a few things. Antisemitism should have no place in America &#8212; not on college campuses or anywhere else. But there is nothing inherently antisemitic about condemning the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza that has so far killed at least 34,000 people, mostly women and children.

I'm also blocking people who hype ActivityPub in comments to my posts about social web stuff that has nothing to do with AP. I've been down this road before. I just want to find people with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html">active minds</a>, whose business is interop, who want to try stuff out. AP is not a good foundation to build on, at least until they come up with a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22busy+developer+guide%22">BDG</a> for it. Basically it isn't a standard even though they say it is. If you want to help your cause: 1. Stop hyping. 2. Get busy with that BDG.

If someone I don't know posts a negative comment on Facebook, in response to something I posted, I just delete it, because they have that feature (other systems don't, they should). Any lurker who happens by is free to enjoy what I write. But if I don't know you, I honestly don't care what you think, esp if it's negative and has less than ten syllables total. It's hit and run spam for sure. I'm widening my definition of spam all the time. If you add up all the responses that actually mean anything, it doesn't amount to much. Let's see what the social web looks like without hearing from all assholes.
