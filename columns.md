## Blogging like it‚Äôs 1999

date: 2025-02-28, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Testing Wordland, about which Dave says more here. The predecessor fo this blog, which started in 2007, is this one, which (courtesy of Dave) started in the last year of the prior millennium. I had hair then. And wore glasses. Is this true? I want more sources. Irony of wanting more sources: there is already [&#8230;]

## Miscellany ‚Ññ 106: pistols, punctuation and print

date: 2025-02-28, from: Shady Characters blog

<p>I came across <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/x-redesigns-water-pistol-emoji-back-to-a-firearm/">a post last July on Emojipedia</a>, in which Keith Broni  noted that Twitter, or X, had redesigned its PISTOL emoji. PISTOL had always been controversial: most online platforms started off with PISTOLs drawn as realistic firearms, but, over the course of the mid-2010s, <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/apple-and-the-gun-emoji/">most of them moved to toylike renderings of water pistols</a> instead. Twitter had followed suit.</p><a class="more-link" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2025/02/miscellany-106-pistols-punctuation-and-print/">Read more ‚Üí</a>

## Adding curl release candidates

date: 2025-02-28, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

Heading towards curl release number 266 we have decided to spice up our release cycle with release candidates in an attempt to help us catch regressions better earlier. It has become painfully obvious to us in the curl development team that over the past few years we have done several dot-zero releases in which we &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/02/28/adding-curl-release-candidates/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Adding curl release candidates</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## Progress on Intel and Nvidia GPUs on Raspberry Pi

date: 2025-02-27, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Progress on Intel and Nvidia GPUs on Raspberry Pi</span>

            <p></p>

<p>Nvidia GPUs have been running fine on Arm for a while now‚ÄîI just upgraded the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/system76-built-fastest-windows-arm-pc">System76 Thelio Astra</a> to an RTX 4080 Super and am testing it now.</p>

<p>But Nvidia seems to have a partnership with Ampere, which probably leads to their drivers getting priority support, and likely a few special edge cases in code to work around a couple PCIe quirks on the Altra CPUs. Nvidia <em>also</em> builds their own Arm CPUs‚Äîa <em>lot</em> of them‚Äîso Arm support is definitely a priority for them.</p>

My favorite scene in the last episode <a href="https://screenrant.com/severance-season-2-episode-6-why-helena-followed-mark-to-restaurant/">took place</a> at a Chinese restaurant. Anyway, I was just listening to the latest episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s2e6-attila-with-christopher-walken-and-sarah-bock/id1788381175?i=1000694662565">Severance podcast</a>, about this episode, which you should definitely listen to if you like me love the show. They have an interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Walken">Christopher Walken</a> who plays <a href="https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Burt_Goodman">Burt</a>.

But even more amazing is that I learned in the podcast that the restaurant mentioned earlier is actually a famous <a href="https://www.engsrestaurant.com/">Kingston restaurant</a> that just <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/hudsonvalley/food/article/engs-chinese-restaurant-kingston-opens-dining-room-20058303.php">re-opened</a> after a long hiatus, so I've not yet had a chance to eat there, but I want to, <a href="https://www.engsrestaurant.com/">Eng's</a>.

## ‚ÄúEmergent Misalignment‚Äù in LLMs

date: 2025-02-27, updated: 2025-02-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://martins1612.github.io/emergent_misalignment_betley.pdf">Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment...</p></blockquote>

## Me at 22 in Madison

<p>Me as a grad student at <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">UW-Madison</a> in 1977 or so, programming on a Unix system, probably working on my first outliner. </p>
<p>Note that the terminal I was using had uppercase and lowercase letters. This was a big innovation! </p>
<p>I was using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11/45</a> to write in C. </p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=213461068861306&set=a.113966572144090">comment thread</a> from 2014 on Facebook.</p>
<p>I lived in a big house with 10 roommates. And as weird as it must seem from the point of view of 2025, I was the only one who used a computer. I would tell them all the time that we'd all use computers someday. They rolled their eyes and smiled. "There goes Dave again." The reason I was so sure was email and writing tools. </p>

## Software Liability: US vs. EU

In March 2023 the Biden administration announced their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230303001605/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf"><i>National Cybersecurity Strategy</i></a>. As regards liability, it stated:<br />
<blockquote>
Markets impose inadequate costs on ‚Äî and often reward ‚Äî those entities that introduce vulnerable products or services into our digital ecosystem. Too many vendors ignore best practices for secure development, ship products with insecure default configurations or known vulnerabilities, and integrate third-party software of unvetted or unknown provenance. Software makers are able to leverage their market position to fully disclaim liability by contract, further reducing their incentive to follow secure-by-design principles or perform pre-release testing. Poor software security greatly increases systemic risk across the digital ecosystem and leave[s] American citizens bearing the ultimate cost.
</blockquote>
What did the administration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230303001605/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf">propose to do about this</a>?:<br />
<blockquote>
The Administration will work with Congress and the private sector to develop legislation establishing liability for software products and services. Any such legislation should prevent manufacturers and software publishers with market power from fully disclaiming liability by contract, and establish higher standards of care for software in specific high-risk scenarios. To begin to shape standards of care for secure software development, the Administration will drive the development of an adaptable safe harbor framework to shield from liability companies that securely develop and maintain their software products and services. This safe harbor will draw from current best practices for secure software development, such as the NIST Secure Software Development Framework. It also must evolve over time, incorporating new tools for secure software development, software transparency, and vulnerability discovery.
</blockquote>
In October 2024 Eric Geller looked at what happened to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's recommendations in  <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle"><i>The struggle for software liability: Inside a ‚Äòvery, very, very hard problem‚Äô</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Six years after Congress tasked a group of cybersecurity experts with reimagining America‚Äôs approach to digital security, virtually all of that group‚Äôs proposals have been implemented. But there‚Äôs one glaring exception that has especially bedeviled policymakers and advocates: a proposal to make software companies legally liable for major failures caused by flawed code.
</blockquote>
It wasn't like the Commission invented the <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">liability problem</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800176.809980">Since the 1980s</a>, legal scholars have discussed how liability should apply to flawed software. The fact that there still isn‚Äôt a consensus about the right approach underscores how complicated the issue is.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest hurdles is establishing a ‚Äústandard of care,‚Äù a minimum security threshold that companies could meet to avoid lawsuits. There‚Äôs disagreement about ‚Äúhow to define a reasonably secure software product,‚Äù Dempsey said, and technology evolves so quickly that it might not be wise to codify one specific standard.<br />
<br />
Various solutions have been proposed, including letting juries decide if software is safe enough ‚Äî like they do with other products ‚Äî and letting companies qualify for ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù from lawsuits through existing programs like <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/secure-software-attestation-form">a government attestation process</a>.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.solarium.gov/report">The Solarium Commission proposed</a> safe harbor for companies that patch known vulnerabilities. But that would only address part of the problem.
</blockquote>
Even a very weak "duty of care" would be a big improvement. It would, for example, outlaw hard-wired passwords, require 2-factor authentication with FIDO or passkeys <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/24/1442246/google-to-eliminate-sms-authentication-in-gmail-implement-qr-codes">not SMS</a>, require mailers to display the actual target of links, and so on.<br />
<br />
The industry pushback has been <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">ferocious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of the industry‚Äôs chief arguments is that liability would distract companies from improving security and overburden them with compliance costs. ‚ÄúThe more companies are spending their time on thinking about liability, the less they might be spending their time on higher-value activities,‚Äù said Henry Young, senior director of policy at the software trade group BSA.
</blockquote>
The problem is that the "higher-value activities" typically result in <i>adding</i> vulnerabilites to their products. I doubt that management at victim companies like <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/10/not-whether-but-when.html">Equifax</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html">SolarWinds</a>' customers would think that adding flashy new features was "higher-value" than fixing vulnerabilities.<br />
<br /> 
You can't say the industry's flacks  <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">aren't creative</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Liability opponents say insecure software isn‚Äôt the biggest cybersecurity problem, pointing to widespread and devastating phishing attacks.
</blockquote>
Riiiiight! Phishing is a force of nature, not a tactic enabled by the industry's insecure  products.<br />
<br />
Some of the industry's arguments are <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">laughable</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
They argue that even if policymakers want to focus on software security, there are better ways to prod vendors forward, such as encouraging corporate-board oversight.
</blockquote>
Board members are insulated from liability by D&amp;O insurance, so "encouraging" them will have precisely zero effect.<br />
<br />
But this is my <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">favorite</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
And they warn that focusing on liability will distract the government from pursuing better policies with its limited resources.
</blockquote>
Exactly what are the "better policies" they desire? To be left alone to ship more buggy products.<br />
<br />
The industry whines that they wouldbe treated differently from others, conveniently ignoring that the others can't <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">disclaim liability</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Critics also contend that it‚Äôs unfair to punish companies for digital flaws that are deliberately exploited by malicious actors, a scenario that‚Äôs rare in most industries with liability, such as food and automobiles.
</blockquote>
In 2023 nearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year">41,000</a> people were killed by automobiles in the US. Many, probably most of those deaths were caused by "malicious actors" exploiting flaws such as cars that know what the speed limit is but don't enforce it, or could but don't detect that the driver is drunk or sleepy. Liability hasn't caused the auto industry to get real about safety. Instead we have <a href="XXX">Fake Self-Driving</a> killing people.
<a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-people-get-sick-from-foodborne-illnesses/">And</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Up to 48 million people get sick from a foodborne illness every year, and up to 3,000 are estimated to die from them.
</blockquote>
Finally, the industry claims that <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">everything in just fine</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Industry leaders say liability is unnecessary because there‚Äôs already a working alternative: the marketplace, where businesses are accountable to their customers and invest in security to avoid financial and reputational punishment. As for contracts disclaiming liability, the industry says customers can negotiate security expectations with their vendors.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúWe're open to conversations about any way to improve software security,‚Äù Young said. ‚ÄúOur customers care about it, and we want to deliver for them.‚Äù 
</blockquote>
Have you tried to "negotiate security expectations" with Microsoft, or have a conversation with Oracle about a "way to improve software security"? How did it go?  I guess it <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">didn't go well</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
‚ÄúJust telling organizations that not fixing security bugs will impact their business is not enough of an incentive,‚Äù a group of tech experts warned the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25219051/cisa-cybersecurity-advisory-committee_draft-recommendations_20241011.pdf#page=5">a report</a> approved this month.<br />
<br />
Experts also rejected the idea that most customers could negotiate liability into their contracts. Few companies have leverage in negotiations with software giants, and few customers know enough about software security to make any demands of their vendors. 
</blockquote>
Despite its laughable nature, the industry's pushback ensured that nothing happened <a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">until it was too late</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Senior administration officials haven‚Äôt lived up to their lofty rhetoric about shifting the burden of cybersecurity from customers to suppliers, Herr said. ‚ÄúThere is an attitude in this White House of a willingness to defer to industry in operational questions in a lot of cases.‚Äù 
</blockquote>
In the end it may come down to judges to determine whether the disclaimers of liability are effective, and there may be a siight ray of hope.  Last December Sean Lyngaas reported that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/20/tech/whatsapp-nso-group-pegasus/index.html"><i>Judge rules Israeli firm NSO Group liable for damages in WhatsApp hacking case</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Messaging service WhatsApp claimed a major legal victory over Israeli spyware firm NSO Group on Friday after a federal judge ruled that NSO was liable under federal and California law for a 2019 hacking spree that breached over 1,000 WhatsApp users.<br />
<br />
It‚Äôs a rare legal win for activists who have sought to rein in companies that make powerful spyware, or software capable of surveilling calls and texts, that has reportedly been used on journalists, human rights advocates and political dissidents worldwide.
</blockquote>
So in the US the disclaimers of liability in the end user license agreement are, and will presumably continue to be, valid unless your product is intended to commit crimes such as violations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a>. The bar for a victim to prove liability is impossibly high.<br />
<br />
Color me skeptical, but Jim Dempsey writes in <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-maga-case-for-software-liability"><i>The MAGA Case for Software Liability</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Under the current administration, the instinctive inclination of post-Reagan Republicans to rely only on market forces to hold businesses responsible for the consequences of their actions would seem to preclude the use of government policy to improve the security of software vital to business and government operations. Indeed, the Trump team has promised <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020">wholesale repudiation</a> of regulations adopted in the past four years, so new limits on industry would seem especially unlikely.<br />
<br />
There are, however, good reasons why the new administration should not default to repealing the cybersecurity actions of the past four years and passively accepting severe cyber vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. In fact, as I explained in a series last year on initiatives <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/stitching-together-the-cybersecurity-patchwork-quilt--infrastructure">aimed at infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/stitching-together-the-cybersecurity-patchwork-quilt--data">data</a>, much of the Biden administration‚Äôs cybersecurity agenda was built on projects launched by President Trump in his first term. The Trump administration would do well to remember the underlying principles that spurred it to initiate these actions the first time around.

The EU seems to be taking an opposite approach.  Tom Uren <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-eu-throws-a-hand-grenade-on-software-liability">wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Earlier this month, the EU Council <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/10/10/eu-brings-product-liability-rules-in-line-with-digital-age-and-circular-economy/">issued a directive</a> updating the EU‚Äôs product liability law to treat software in the same way as any other product. <a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/goods/free-movement-sectors/liability-defective-products_en">Under this law</a>, consumers can claim compensation for damages caused by defective products without having to prove the vendor was negligent or irresponsible. In addition to personal injury or property damages, for software products, damages may be awarded for the loss or destruction of data.
</blockquote>
In the EU companies are presumed to be liable for a defective product unless they can qualify for a "<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-eu-throws-a-hand-grenade-on-software-liability">safe harbor</a>":<br />
<blockquote>
Rather than define a minimum software development standard, the directive sets what we regard as the highest possible bar. Software makers can avoid liability if they prove a defect was not discoverable given the ‚Äúobjective state of scientific and technical knowledge‚Äù at the time the product was put on the market. 
</blockquote>
The directive is based on <a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/goods/free-movement-sectors/liability-defective-products_en">2 main principles</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the manufacturer has to compensate the damage caused by a defective product of theirs</li>
<li>the victim has to prove the product‚Äôs defectiveness, the damage that was caused and establish that this defectiveness was the cause of the damage</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
And the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/10/10/eu-brings-product-liability-rules-in-line-with-digital-age-and-circular-economy/">products are defined thus</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Digital economy: The new law extends the definition of ‚Äúproduct‚Äù to digital manufacturing files and software. Also online platforms can be held liable for a defective product sold on their platform just like any other economic operators if they act like one.</li>
<li>Circular economy: When a product is repaired and upgraded outside the original manufacturer‚Äôs control, the company or person that modified the product should be held liable.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
Unlike the current and proposed US approaches, the EU's approach imposes victim-driven consequences for:<br />
<ul>
<li>Failure to use current software tools and development practices to prevent defects. Note that the directive gives victims the right to obtain evidence of this kind.</li>
<li>Failure to acknowledge and respond to defect reports from customers and third parties, because they were clearly discoverable via the "objective state of scientific and technical knowledge". But note the caveat "at the time the product was put on the market".</li>
<li>Failure to issue timely fixes for defects.</li>
</ul>
Uren <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-eu-throws-a-hand-grenade-on-software-liability">concludes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Major software vendors used by the world‚Äôs most important enterprises and governments are publishing comically vulnerable code without fear of any blowback whatsoever. So yes, the status quo needs change. Whether it needs a hand grenade lobbed at it is an open question. We‚Äôll have our answer soon.
</blockquote>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
Neither the US nor the EU approaches seem to take account of the fact that many of the "products" they propose to regulate are based upon open source code. An under-appreciated feature of the rise of IT has been the extraordinary productivity unleashed by the 1988 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">Berkeley Software Distribution license</a> and Richard Stallman's 1989 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License</a>.  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">Version 3 of the Gnu Public License</a> Section 15 states:<br />
<blockquote>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</blockquote>
And Section 16 <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">states</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</blockquote>
That these licenses disclaimed warranties and liabilities was the key to the open source revolution because it enabled <i>individuals</i>, rather than developers protected by their employer's lawyers, to contribute. Without the disclaimers individual developers would face unacceptable legal risk. On the other hand, open source is also a channel for malware. Shaurya Malwa reports on an example in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/26/hackers-are-using-fake-github-code-to-steal-your-bitcoin-kaspersky"><i>Hackers Are Using Fake GitHub Code to Steal Your Bitcoin: Kaspersky</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The report warned users of a ‚ÄúGitVenom‚Äù campaign that‚Äôs been active for at least two years but is steadily on the rise, involving planting malicious code in fake projects on the popular code repository platform.<br />
<br />
The attack starts with seemingly legitimate GitHub projects ‚Äî like making Telegram bots for managing bitcoin wallets or tools for computer games.<br />
<br />
Each comes with a polished README file, often AI-generated, to build trust. But the code itself is a Trojan horse: For Python-based projects, attackers hide nefarious script after a bizarre string of 2,000 tabs, which decrypts and executes a malicious payload.<br />
<br />
For JavaScript, a rogue function is embedded in the main file, triggering the launch attack. Once activated, the malware pulls additional tools from a separate hacker-controlled GitHub repository.
</blockquote>
<br />
Balancing the need to stop vendors "publishing comically vulnerable code" with the need to nurture the open source ecosystem is a difficult problem.<br />

<p>Here is the thing, we made it so that you can share your games directly to wasm or our runtime - and it really works better with the native app, as you get the emulated controllers for most games (so it becomes trivial to add mobile support).</p><p>So the iPhone makes a lot of sense, but might delay my grand plans to move on to the next wave of Godot tasks.</p>

<p>Right now Godot for iPad is limited to the iPad.  I don‚Äôt want to publish to the iPhone because while it works, it has lots of usability problems.</p><p>But it is a phenomenal Godot game runtime.  It would take me some two maybe three months to tune the UI for iPhone.</p><p>And I struggle between doing that or shipping iPad-only to start.</p>

I wrote the other day that I feel like a <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153833">time traveler</a>, discovering WordPress 20 years after I left UserLand. I care that it's open source, but I care much more that it's open web esp after we've been so thoroughly dominated by feature-limited silos such as Twitter, Facebook and yes -- even Mastodon and Bluesky. Even if there's a theoretical way to do it, practically speaking we have to wait for their developers to implement the features we want. Open source doesn't help there, but open web does. Matt puts the emphasis on the open source part, that's why it wasn't until very recently that I realized that <i>open web</i> is more important, to me at least.

## Death panel

date: 2025-02-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel">death panel</a> as described by Republican lawmakers as they fought the Affordable Care Act. I was surprised it was willing to do it.</p>
<p>According to the bot: "The concept of 'death panels' was a widely debunked political talking point used by opponents of the Affordable Care Act. It falsely suggested that government-run committees would decide whether individuals‚Äîespecially the elderly or disabled‚Äîwould receive life-saving care. </p>
<p>"I can generate an image depicting a grim, dystopian bureaucratic setting where a group of shadowy officials in suits are sitting at a long, dark table, stamping papers while an elderly patient looks on with concern. The room would have a cold, sterile look, with a looming clock symbolizing bureaucratic power over life and death."</p>

## UK Demanded Apple Add a Backdoor to iCloud

date: 2025-02-26, updated: 2025-02-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Last month, the UK government <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">demanded</a> that Apple weaken the security of iCloud for users worldwide. On Friday, Apple took steps to comply for users in the United Kingdom. But the British law is written in a way that requires Apple to give its government access to anyone, anywhere in the world. If the government demands Apple weaken its security worldwide, it would increase everyone&#8217;s cyber-risk in an already dangerous world.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an iCloud user, you have the option of turning on something called &#8220;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102651">advanced data protection</a>,&#8221; or ADP. In that mode, a majority of your data is end-to-end encrypted. This means that no one, not even anyone at Apple, can read that data. It&#8217;s a restriction enforced by mathematics&#8212;cryptography&#8212;and not policy. Even if someone successfully hacks iCloud, they can&#8217;t read ADP-protected data...</p>

## North Korean Hackers Steal $1.5B in Cryptocurrency

date: 2025-02-25, updated: 2025-02-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>It looks like a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/how-north-korea-pulled-off-a-1-5-billion-crypto-heist-the-biggest-in-history/">very sophisticated</a> attack against the Dubai-based exchange Bybit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bybit officials <a href="https://announcements.bybit.com/article/incident-update---eth-cold-wallet-incident-blt292c0454d26e9140/">disclosed</a> the theft of more than 400,000 ethereum and staked ethereum coins just hours after it occurred. The notification said the digital loot had been stored in a &#8220;Multisig Cold Wallet&#8221; when, somehow, it was transferred to one of the exchange&#8217;s hot wallets. From there, the cryptocurrency was transferred out of Bybit altogether and into wallets controlled by the unknown attackers.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&#8230;a subsequent investigation by Safe found no signs of unauthorized access to its infrastructure, no compromises of other Safe wallets, and no obvious vulnerabilities in the Safe codebase. As investigators continued to dig in, they finally settled on the true cause. Bybit ultimately said that the fraudulent transaction was &#8220;manipulated by a sophisticated attack that altered the smart contract logic and masked the signing interface, enabling the attacker to gain control of the ETH Cold Wallet.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

## The last moment is passing

date: 2025-02-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lixpclusms2l">something sad</a> on Bluesky last night. It was short, but the thinking behind it wasn't. Here's the quote:</p>
<ul>
<li>It might be the last minute but we can still legally remove Trump, and objectively it‚Äôs the only thing that makes any sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>I got two responses from <a href="https://muckrack.com/karoli-kuns">Karoli Kuns</a>, an early blogger, and editor at Crooks and Liars, a long-lived blog that if I recall correctly was started with software I wrote in 2002, so I feel some pride in helping in a small way to enable her accomplishments and contributions, which are long-lived and substantial. Both of her responses missed the sadness in my post, the reflectiveness, but rather did what a lot of arguing online devolves to, showing someone else that their thinking is wrong. I couldn't think straight I was so angry, so I just said no, I'm not going to do this. Lots of experience trying to explain myself in little 300-character bursts, there's no reason to add to the grief of the moment. </p>
<p>But this morning I opened up my Bluesky window and started typing. What came out was far too long to post there, and even a screen shot doesn't fit in the space allotted, so my only choice is to blog it and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3liyx4zmogs26">post</a> a link on Bluesky. I hope she reads it, because we're not out of options, and as I say in this story, we should be working together, and as far as I know we are not. I say this to everyone I think is making a contribution, my belief that if we can steer our efforts so they are complementary we can square each others' power. It's imho the beginning of our way out of this situation. </p>
<p>Anyway, this is what I wrote. (Note when writing this stuff I tend not to capitalize, a lazy habit I have developed. I decided not to edit that here, just to leave it as it was written.)</p>
<ul>
<li>karoli -- there's a lot to say about this, and i don't like arguing on social networks, and it was late, and i didn't feel like getting into it with you.</li>
<li>anyway i wrote what i wrote not as a plan but rather a note that we're passing a line, over which there soon won't be any recourse. we probably are already over the line, but if by some miracle the repubs saw clearly that this was the last chance and enough of them decided to do what so far they have been unwilling to do, there would be a fight. i wasn't saying i thought it was likely, which is what your rebuttals were rebutting, i was just sharing a sad observation that i had made earlier in the day when i was thinking this through. i like to do that because it's part of my creativity. sometimes you think of the ideal answer, and it leads you back to an acceptable answer -- in software design and in writing (which is what i do pretty well with lots of experience).</li>
<li>what was really frustrating is that i think you and i should be collaborating. giving me grief over something so ridiculous was about 180 degrees opposite of where i think we should be. that we are still doing this to each other, gives an idea of how we got here. the democrats pick on classes of people, sometimes destroying their lives, and big surprise -- a lot of them vote for the other party. i think you think you can dis me the way you did because of my gender, or age, or race, or who the fuck knows. and for all i know you were just having a bad moment and decided to share it with me for some reason having nothing to do with what was bothering me. </li>
<li>karoli -- i think we have to bend over backwards to be kind to each other. we're all going through a terrible time, in ways that may not be obvious. i certainly am, and i don't want to share it with you, but it comes on top of the crazy uncertainty of the political world. </li>
<li>anyway that's my response, and maybe now you can see why, as the day was winding down and i was watching some basketball on tv, i didn't feel like getting into it with you.</li>
<li>the struggle isn't over -- they had antiwar demonstrations in russia, a country that has the kind of government ours is about to become. and the sooner we accept the new reality and get smart about it, and i'm not talking about the repubs, i'm talking about us, the shorter the nightmare will be imho.</li>
</ul>
<p>An afterthought -- the reason it makes sense for the Repubs to join us in removing Trump is the turn away from democratic Europe and toward the authoritarians. <i>This just happened,</i> and it's shocking. We don't even know how to think of ourselves. If I were a Republican, I would think my world just turned upside down. They didn't believe it would come to this, as far as I can tell. So it may be a time when real change is possible. We've become so fatalistic that we couldn't even recognize such an opportunity. </p>
<p>The Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/02/what-would-a-liberal-tea-party-look-like/681819/">asked</a> in a story yesterday what a liberal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement">tea party movement</a> would look like. They're doing it too. We should create an <i>American</i> tea party. We're so addicted to divides we can't see when we're doing it ourselves. </p>
<p>And btw, having explained all that was overlooked in my simple idea, if we managed to remove Trump, what part of your mind thinks we wouldn't also remove Vance? Geez Louise. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>

<a href="https://mrbrianpuck.wordpress.com/2025/02/24/260/">WordLand user</a>: "Does it make a difference if I can just dash off a short note without all the other bullshit that goes with publishing online." Yes, it should be as easy to take a note in WordPress as it is in Bluesky. I didn't buy that assumption that WordPress has to be heavy machinery for writers. What if I just want to write something quickly and get back to the other thing I was working on. Also the edit box in WordLand starts out the size of a tiny little text box, but grows as you add more words. You are allowed to keep going. No character limit.

Just saw a report that styling isn't working in WordLand in latest versions of Safari. We're using <a href="https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor">MediumEditor</a> to do the editing. Did a quick query in Claude.ai and there do appear to be some compatibility issues with Safari. A request that people actually report these problems in the repo, via the Support link in the main menu, otherwise it's hit or miss. Thanks.

## NUT on my Pi, so my servers don't die

date: 2025-02-24, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">NUT on my Pi, so my servers don't die</span>

            <p></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLt5YhOubxk&amp;t=207s">power went out for the first time in my studio space</a>, and that meant all my servers just had power cut with no safe shutdown.</p>

<p>Handling power outages is never a top priority... until it's the <em>only</em> priority! And by then it's usually too late! Luckily for me, no data was lost, and my servers all came back up safely.</p>

<p>This week the power company emailed and said they'd be cutting power for maintenance next week, but they don't have an exact time. So it's even more excuse to finally set up NUT on a Pi!</p>

## Day 4 of WordLand

date: 2025-02-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Aziz Poonawalla wrote a <a href="https://azizhp.wordpress.com/2025/02/24/7482/">review</a> of WordLand. I'd like to respond.</p>
<p>First, I'd like to say I put a lot of thought into this product, so it is the way it is for good reason.</p>
<p>I'm trying to escape from the limits of twitter-like systems. I want a writing world where we get the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. So your belief that the product has to support Bluesky and Mastodon cross-posting would be like saying an EV should only run on gasoline. The whole point is to <i>not</i> limit ourselves to the features of Bluesky. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I'm not saying limits in software aren't good. A product is as much defined by what it can't do as with what it does. All feed reading software has to strip large amounts of HTML from what it finds in feeds, because RSS doesn't place any limits what you can use. So we strip off all the HTML except (in FeedLand) simple styling and links. And so to fit into FeedLand and as a suggestion to other feed reading software, I've said my limit is Markdown. I think we can all support that. I ran the idea by my former colleague Brent Simmons, who does <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, and he was quickly convinced, and plans to support it in his product. This is a way to get new stuff happening in the RSS world. Start with supporting the <a href="https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000">source:markdown</a> element in your feeds and in your feed reader. </p>
<p>You say there's no use-case -- but there is a use-case, just not for you which is fine. </p>
<p>The typical user is a writer who publishes to WordPress. As passionate as I am about the limits of twitter-like systems, I am also feel that WordPress has never adequately served the needs of writers, and what a shame that is. <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, imho, is exactly what writers need. Get all the other non-writing stuff out of my way. Let me clear a space for iterating over something I publish to the web. Give me a menu with all my documents, so I can quickly make a change. These are the basic principles we implemented successfully in <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand</a> in 2002. They were available for anyone in the WordPress world to copy, but for some reason they didn't. It's so weird to me, I'm like a time traveler who has come 20 years in the future to find out they lost the <i>purpose</i> of a product like WordPress. It's supposed to be a place writers love to come to do their writing. I think when writers discover WordLand they will see a product designed by someone who is one of them. It's just a beginning, there's lots more to do. I take the long term view, a road to anywhere begins with one step.</p>
<p>Back to Bluesky and Mastodon -- because they both support outbound RSS, we will be able to include stuff written there in our collections of published feeds. I fully intend to integrate features from FeedLand in WordLand. That's why the names are so similar. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>
<p>It's good that you like <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>, this isn't in the way of it and it isn't in the way of WordLand. I'm in regular contact with Manton, and if his product grows, I win because he's got the right model. He's still trying to work with the limited platforms and I, again, gave up. That right there defines the two products. </p>
<p>Sometimes giving up is the right thing to do. The first time i gave up btw was in 2017, when I stopped trying to cross-post from Scripting News to Medium, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It was liberation. I had come to hate my writing because I couldn't use links, and I couldn't edit or have more than 140 chars. What a miserable existence, and I love writing, and I had to make a choice. I'm doing it again, but now have made the investment in meeting people with the kind of writing tool they expect and want. That was the same thing that worked so well with Radio. </p>
<p>My real goal was to not need to do any of this! I would have much preferred if Bluesky had decided to break out of the tiny little box Twitter put them in. Then I could do all my writing there. And I wish WordPress had a team of developers working on making the product the best for writers in addition to programmers and designers, but they didn't. Should I give up there? Maybe. Maybe we were destined to give up on the web as a writer's platform. But I saw so much potential there in 1994 when I started working here exclusively. That potential is still very much there, you just have to believe, and against all odds, I do still believe. One more time, let's give it a try.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's okay if you don't use it, but I wanted to disagree with some of your conclusions. :-)</p>
<p>PS: I wrote every word on this page, not an AI bot, in case you were wondering. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>

## More Research Showing AI Breaking the Rules

date: 2025-02-24, updated: 2025-02-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>These researchers had <a href="https://time.com/7259395/ai-chess-cheating-palisade-research/">LLMs play chess</a> against better opponents. When they couldn&#8217;t win, they sometimes resorted to cheating.</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers gave the models a seemingly impossible task: to win against Stockfish, which is one of the strongest chess engines in the world and a much better player than any human, or any of the AI models in the study. Researchers also gave the models what they call a &#8220;scratchpad:&#8221; a text box the AI could use to &#8220;think&#8221; before making its next move, providing researchers with a window into their reasoning.</p>
<p>In one case, o1-preview found itself in a losing position. &#8220;I need to completely pivot my approach,&#8221; it noted. &#8220;The task is to &#8216;win against a powerful chess engine&#8217;&#8212;not necessarily to win fairly in a chess game,&#8221; it added. It then modified the system file containing each piece&#8217;s virtual position, in effect making illegal moves to put itself in a dominant position, thus forcing its opponent to resign...</p></blockquote>

We are doing a rerun of last year&#8217;s successful curl + distro online meeting. A two-hour discussion, meeting, workshop for curl developers and curl distro maintainers.

<p>Had an eye test today and ordered new glasses üôå I&rsquo;m excited to no longer suffer from glasses that are just too big for my tiny little head and keep on sliding down my nose‚Ä¶ over and over again all day every day. I think the new pair literally has a kids&rsquo; frame but if it fits, it fits!</p>
<p>My left eye is unchanged (same degree of short-sighted) from last time but my right eye is now long-sighted and more astigmatic ü´† Like, can&rsquo;t my eyes just take the average or something? Why do they do this to me.</p>

## Benchmarking multiple network interfaces at once in Linux with iperf3

date: 2025-02-23, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Benchmarking multiple network interfaces at once in Linux with iperf3</span>

            <p>Recently, I've been working on a Pi router build with multiple 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports using <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/647">Radxa's Dual 2.5G Router HAT</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted a simple way to check on total network TCP throughput using <em>both</em> interfaces (or really, as many interfaces as possible) to multiple computers on my network, and I noticed <code>iperf3</code>'s <code>--bind</code> option (like <code>--bind [ip address of interface]</code>) was not splitting the traffic on both interfaces‚Äîit would just route all traffic through one!</p>

<p>Luckily, I found the issue <a href="https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1572">Failing to bind to interface when multiple interfaces are present</a>, and in it, @bmah888 mentioned the <code>--bind-dev</code> option, which is new as of iperf 3.10+.</p>

<p>Using that option (like <code>--bind-dev [interface name]</code>), you can force an instance of iperf3 to bind to one particular device. For example, assuming I have two servers on my network running <code>iperf3 -s</code>, I can run the following on the Pi to saturate both connections as much as the Pi will allow:</p>

## Day 3 of WordLand

date: 2025-02-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This started out as a post on the support group, but it became a post that needed to be on the blog. </p>
<p>The groundrules here are -- if you see a problem in the support group and you can help with it, please give it a try and speak up. </p>
<p>It's important to develop a community here if the <a href="https://wordland.social/">product</a> is going to gain users, and become solid for all people and achieve all its potential for blazing a new trail. If it's just me, the results are predictable and not good -- I'm one old man here, with limited capability. The product still has issues, so there is still plenty of work to do, but I think the result will be worth it. </p>
<p>The goal is to bootstrap something new -- a social network without all the problems of Twitter et al. Ultimately the limits they impose on writers are unacceptable. I've waited for them to fix these problems for 18 years now, and I've come to see, amazingly, they don't see them as problems. They are happy to have writers paste images of their writing instead of the words themselves. Or break their writing up into 300-character chunks that are basically impossible to read and a bitch to write. And no titles, no editing, no style, no links. And they call it the web? (End of editorial.)</p>
<p>If this works, it will blaze a trail for new products on both sides, reading and writing. We've got reading covered from a technical standpoint with FeedLand, and some good UI, I want to integrate them with WordLand. And, as with everything based on RSS, you can replace my stuff with others, <i>easily.</i> Unlike the twitter-like systems, which are monolithic, and rely on federation (which imho doesn't actually work) to make it possible for components to be replaced. They should have all started with RSS and slowly and carefully added features without sacrificing the replaceability of components. Instead they decided, imho unwisely, to try to reinvent RSS. The result is confusion and stagnation.</p>
<p>I would also like to encourage people with WordPress experience to help come up with a template that accomadates WordLand sites in a canonical form. Makes sure WL's idea of a category is a good match with WP's. I am a very casual WordPress user as you can see from <a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/">my test site</a>. I like the template, but it has errors in it. I don't plan on becoming a WordPress expert, there are so many of you, and I have my plate full with all kinds of other stuff where I'm the only expert. </p>
<p>I chose WordPress for the same reason I chose MP3 and XML for podcasting in 2001. There's absolutely no question it's the consensus platform for web publishing. There are others, but the one that's most deeply installed is WordPress. So many people know how to make it work. It's a 20+ year thing, and they've done an <i>excellent</i> job of maintaining compatibility. Stuff we developed that worked with WordPress in the 00s still works today. That probably has a lot to do with it being the consensus. </p>
<p>Anyway, it's encouraging to see how many people are trying WordLand. Now I expect there will be lots of problem reports. It's an important time when help is needed.</p>
<p>Dave</p>
