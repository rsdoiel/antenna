## 2024-07-09 Murten

date: 2024-07-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-09-murten">2024-07-09 Murten</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;re spending two nights in Murten or Morat. The lake is small with a circumference of about 25km. <a href="2018-murten/index">A few years ago</a> we ran around it ‚Äì but today we ran about six or seven kilometres before turning back. 13km is enough, these days. We&rsquo;re both out of shape, sadly.</p>

<p>Just after sunset, looking out over the lake.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Working on a half-enclosed patio until late into the night. There was drunken shouting to be heard until midnight, on a Monday. I did not know that this sleepy town was so rowdy!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The town itself looks unchanged from our last visit in 2018.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We ran over to the eastern side of the lake, a protected wetland.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our destination was this village at the foot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Vully">Mont Vully</a>.
A rather small mountain.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It got rather hot so by the time we arrived in Sugiez, I was so very tired.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Canals connect the lake of Murte, the lake of Neuch√¢tel and the lake of Bienne. So many motorboats with proud men and underdressed women going up and down the channel. üôÑ</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first sunflowers are out!</p>

## Jon Stewart, yes you should STFU

date: 2024-07-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>The problem is elites grabbing the steering wheel with no clue about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff.</p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/14/bidenActionFigure.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Every Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart's opening for the Daily Show on YouTube. It's always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice. </p>
<p>If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There's never been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff. </p>
<p>I've been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren't any smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that's been the real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we've gotten the tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And now we're at the last moment before it's all flushed away and the NYT et al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less. </p>
<p>Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don't think I've ever done that in a podcast, and I'm not sure I like it. But the rage is real. </p>

## 2024-07-08 Neuch√¢tel

date: 2024-07-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-08-neuch√¢tel">2024-07-08 Neuch√¢tel</h1>

<p>We spent two nights in Neuenburg or Neuch√¢tel. They came under Prussian control in 1707 because the locals were looking for a government that was far away and wouldn&rsquo;t meddle in their affairs. It became a republic and a canton of Switzerland in 1848.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the death in 1707 of Marie d&rsquo;Orleans-Longueville, duchess de Nemours and Princess of Neuch√¢tel, the people had to choose her successor from among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices. Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but the Neuch√¢telois people passed them over in favour of King Frederick I of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion through the Houses of Orange and Nassau. With the requisite stability assured, Neuch√¢tel entered its golden age, with commerce and industry (including watchmaking and lace) and banking undergoing steady expansion. ‚Äì <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We met a friend and went for a walk in the late afternoon: from La Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.</p>

<p>At the new Jeunes Rives. It looked very nice but we did see a big dead fish, belly up. That dampened our enthusiasm somewhat.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We began our walk around four.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There were some nice waterfalls to see on the way up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And a view of the Lac de Bienne.</p>

<p>More pools‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And waterfalls‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But was cool and full of moss.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>NesselblaÃàttrige Glockenblume<br>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-13.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sometimes you see plants that you feel you have never seen in your whole life.</p>

<p>Wiesen-Wachtelweizen<br>
Melampyrum pratense</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-14.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>An even better view of the lake. That very long and narrow line of land connects the town of Erlach or Cerlier to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Island">St. Peter&rsquo;s Island</a>.</p>

<p>Trying to convince Viv he should go on <cite>Hard Quiz</cite> with the special topic of the 1916 <abbr title="Victorian Football League">VFL</abbr> premiership season, because he&rsquo;s like obsessed with it, hahah. Tonight he&rsquo;s explaining to me at length how many layers there are to it: the class divide, the sectarian divide between Protestants and Catholics in that era, contested notions of masculinity (is it about going off to kill people abroad, or staying home to play sport?)&hellip; honestly, he has me convinced, it&rsquo;s an interesting topic.</p>

## July 8, 2024

date: 2024-07-09, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

On July 9, 1868, Americans changed the U.S. Constitution for the fourteenth time, adapting our foundational document to construct a new nation without systematic Black enslavement. In 1865 the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution had prohibited slavery on the basis of race, but it did not prevent the establishment of a system in which Black Americans continued to be unequal. Backed by President Andrew Johnson, who had taken over the presidency after actor John Wilkes Booth had murdered President Abraham Lincoln, white southern Democrats had done their best to push their Black neighbors back into subservience. So long as southern states had abolished enslavement, repudiated Confederate debts, and nullified the ordinances of secession, Johnson was happy to readmit them to full standing in the Union, still led by the very men who had organized the Confederacy and made war on the United States.

<p>Guys, we have one of those Brother printers that are supposed to be so solid and reliable, but it is not cooperating today. Keeps sending itself to sleep mid-job and &ldquo;going offline&rdquo; so I have to physically walk to it and turn it back on. &ldquo;Printing&rdquo; blank pages. When told to print a three-page document (ONCE), it prints TWO copies of page 1 &amp; 2 then skips page 3. That &ldquo;just buy this Brother printer everyone has, it&rsquo;s fine&rdquo; article lied to me.</p>

## Wordle Kitty is EIC at NYT!

date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Wordle Kitty has become the Editor in Chief of the NY Times! That's pretty cool right. But she's still cute. And she's working late tonight, trying to come up with the perfect cover story. She figured it out! She put a picture of herself on the front page, with a huge headline saying "She's great!" In the picture she's smart and cute and really adorable, and she's smiling and wearing a button that says "Hi Mom!"</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/wordleKittyEICatNYT.png"></center>Wordle Kitty on the front page.</div></p>

## 2024-06-28 Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP

date: 2024-07-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-28-connecting-the-laptop-to-the-server-via-nncp">2024-06-28 Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP</h1>

<p>First, install the <code>nncp</code> package on both systems.
In addition to that, install the <code>openbsd-inetd</code> package on the server.
(In the following passages, I&rsquo;m connected as <code>root</code> to the server.)</p>

<p>Generate new configs on the systems that are missing <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.</p>

<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>

<p>Examine the file using a text editor.
Each system needs to know the public keys of the other.</p>

<p>So, on the laptop, I need to add to add the public keys of the server.
I also want to specify that I&rsquo;m going to call the node on a regular basis
and that files sent to me from that node should be saved in my &ldquo;incoming&rdquo;
directory. I also want to accept mail.</p>

<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/sibirocobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;12 * * * *&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And on the server, I need to add the public keys of the laptop.
I also want to save incoming files from the laptop.
And I want to accept mail.</p>

<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the laptop calls the server but the server does not call the laptop!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure those directories exist:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/incoming
ssh sibirocobombus mkdir incoming
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create a file and send it from the laptop to the server using <code>nncp-file</code>:</p>

<pre><code>echo Hello &gt; hello.txt
sudo -u nncp nncp-file hello.txt sibirocobombus:
</code></pre>

<p>Check the log using <code>nncp-log</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-log | tail -n 1
2024-06-28T21:36:02Z File hello.txt (282 B) is sent to sibirocobombus:hello.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s connect to the server and check:</p>

<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing has arrived!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s call the server using <code>nncp-call</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:07:36Z ERROR Calling sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): dial tcp [2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:5400: connect: connection refused
</code></pre>

<p>Oops. It&rsquo;s not running? That&rsquo;s right, I need to run <code>nncp-daemon</code> on the server side.</p>

<p>Add the following to <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> on the server to accept NNCP connections on port 5400:</p>

<pre><code>5400	stream	tcp	nowait	nncp	/usr/local/bin/nncp-daemon	nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>

<p>Reload it:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl reload openbsd-inetd
</code></pre>

<p>Try again on the laptop:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z We have got for sibirocobombus: 1 packets, 486 B
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z ERROR SP with sibirocobombus (nice MAX): reading: EOF
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z ERROR Connection to sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): EOF
</code></pre>

<p>Back to the server:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-log
2024-06-28T22:15:25Z ERROR SP nice MAX: waiting for first message: unknown peer: ...
2024-06-28T22:15:25Z Connected to unknown
</code></pre>

<p>Strange! That id listed there matches my laptop&rsquo;s <code>noisepub</code>.
Checking the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> on the server again, I see that pasted the wrong pubkeys‚Ä¶ ü§¶
Fix that and try again‚Ä¶</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z We have got for sibirocobombus: 1 packets, 486 B

</code></pre>

<p>Looking good!
Check for the file on the server:</p>

<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not there!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s investigate on the server:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-log
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z Packet QAROTFMX25ZPQOT5DEQQC7JE7EN3UD2FZIJNI6JKH75EC2DMSSZQ (486 B) (nice B): 0%

</code></pre>

<p>This looks good, so we have the packet!
And we can confirm this using <code>nncp-stat</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-stat

</code></pre>

<p>What needs to happen now is &ldquo;tossing&rdquo; using <code>nncp-toss</code>.
This is, &ldquo;processing&rdquo; the packet and thereby delivering it.</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-toss

</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, the incoming file should be writable by more people‚Ä¶</p>

<pre><code>chgrp nncp /home/alex/incoming
chmod g+w /home/alex/incoming
</code></pre>

<p>Try again!</p>

cat /home/alex/incoming/hello.txt

</code></pre>

<p>ü•≥</p>

<p>I need to think about <a href="https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/Administration.html">admin issues</a>, clearly.</p>

<p>I need to set up regular <code>nncp-call</code> on the laptop; I need to set up regular <code>nncp-toss</code> on the server.</p>

<p>It would be nice to switch from <code>inetd</code> to <code>systemd</code> perhaps? Surely they have written a replacement for it. They have written replacements for everything! üò¨</p>

I got there when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I'd never see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn't even take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It's why we're playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden's presidency, because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about Biden's flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The problem isn't that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were to win, we'll be right back here in another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever happens this year, what's waiting for us is for most of us to wake up from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It's all falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else it's over.

## It's that time

date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House, and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the journalists, get away with it again.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the press on our democratic process that I'm pretty depressed about the future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said he'd never do it. If they tried to force him, he'd get a gun and shoot them. This isn't the first time I've heard that, and I called bullshit. You're never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won't do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally -- and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn't believe you are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can't get back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone number). I've been through all these miserable processes. And none of them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where we're headed, again.

I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an incredible <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a> to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news sites. It's more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the full story. Maybe it was a  mistake calling this a blogroll. I'm trying to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for themselves. In any case I'm thinking about what to do next with FeedLand, which is what's behind the blogroll software. It hasn't lived up to my hopes, and I don't think it's likely to. I may be done writing software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years, between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of writing for others was not a success. So I'm thinking about how to wind down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a bit. It's that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

## July 7, 2024 

date: 2024-07-08, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

I have spent the weekend struggling mightily with a new manuscript and have had little time to study the news. The most notable event from the day is that in a stunning upset, French voters have rejected members of Marine Le Pen&#8217;s far-right National Rally party in legislative elections. After the first round of votes, National Rally candidates appeared to be comfortably ahead, but left-wing and centrist candidates combined forces to prevent splitting the vote, and voters then flooded the polls to elect the candidates that coalition fielded.

## Dear journalism

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn't lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.</p>
<p>What you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>We all knew this would happen.</li>
<li>We all saw it happen, we don't need you to tell us.</li>
<li>We're going with him anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>The plan is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election -- VP Harris steps up.</li>
<li>Now everyone can relax.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even bigger story.</p>
<p>BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that they all want Trump to lose? It's logical that they would, but I thought they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous <a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">View From Nowhere</a>. Has that pretense accidentally been dropped?</p>

## Democratic superstars of 2024

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>On Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sarajw@front-end.social/112746718207413752">Sara Joy writes</a>: "Let Biden run. Let Kamala and lots of other younger Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step in."</p>
<p>I had a similar idea.</p>
<p>Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.</p>
<p>Let all the great next generation democrats shine. </p>
<p>Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.</p>
<p>Joe Biden dials in via satellite.</p>
<p>"Listen, I'm an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren't they wonderful!"</p>
<p>He puts on his robe and slippers, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at his feet and his grandchildren playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">yahtzee</a> and checkers...</p>
<p>And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn't spill his beer, so you know they have his back.</p>
<p>Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Collect them all!</p>
<p>You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.</p>
<p>Some would be very rare.</p>
<p>Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack, Michelle and Bill would have a concert. </p>
<p>Hosted by Mayor Pete!</p>
<p>Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.</p>
<p>Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit. </p>
<p>And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers. </p>
<p>Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and the freedom fighters. </p>
<p>All the heroes of America, standing up for America. </p>
<p>The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course Lynne Cheney.</p>
<p>We don't need no freaking monarch, they all sing.</p>
<p>No we don't! shouts the people. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On video</a>, the Dead sing "I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do!"</p>
<p>Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.</p>
<p>We all march together to victory.</p>

## Hot take: social platforms should disallow special character growth hacking

Over the last few years something magical has happened without much fanfare: social media platforms and operating systems automatically translate text content for us.
