## 2025-06-18 Israel hate mail

date: 2025-06-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-06-18-israel-hate-mail">2025-06-18 Israel hate mail</h1>

<p>I got my first comment regarding my position on Israel in a very, very long time.
It wondered why I had not blogged anything about the situation in October 2023.</p>

<p>Well, what can I say?</p>

<p>Back then, I did not know that Israel was going to kill so many civilians in bloody revenge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 7 October 2023, Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel, in which 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 815 civilians, were killed, and 251 taken hostage with the stated goal of forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners. After clearing militants from its territory, Israel launched a bombing campaign and invaded Gaza on 27 October with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. Israeli forces launched numerous campaigns during the invasion, including the Rafah offensive from May 2024, three battles fought around Khan Yunis, and the siege of North Gaza from October 2024, and have assassinated Hamas leaders inside and outside of Gaza. A temporary ceasefire in November 2023 broke down, and a second ceasefire in January 2025 ended with a surprise attack by Israel in March 2025.</p>

<p>Since the start of the Israeli offensive, over 55,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, over half of them women and children, and more than 128,000 Palestinians have been injured. A study in The Lancet estimated 64,260 deaths due to traumatic injuries by June 2024, while noting a larger potential death toll when &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; deaths are included. Israel&rsquo;s tightened blockade of Gaza cut off basic necessities, causing a severe hunger crisis with a high risk of famine persisting as of May 2025. By early 2025, Israel had caused unprecedented destruction in Gaza and made large parts of it uninhabitable, leveling entire cities and destroying hospitals (including children&rsquo;s hospitals), agricultural land, religious and cultural landmarks, educational facilities, and cemeteries. Gazan journalists, health workers, aid workers and other members of civil society have been detained, tortured and killed. Nearly all of the strip&rsquo;s 2.3 million Palestinian population have been forcibly displaced. Over 100,000 Israelis were internally displaced at the height of the conflict.</p>

<p>I mean, the numbers speak for themselves. Take a look at the Humanitarian Situation Updates by the United Nations.
Just recently, from <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-292-gaza-strip">Humanitarian Situation Update #292 | Gaza Strip</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 20 and 26 May, incidents resulting in a large number of fatalities include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>On 20 May, at about 04:00, at least nine Palestinians, including five children and one woman, were reportedly killed when a house was hit in Jabalya refugee camp, in North Gaza.</li>
<li>On 20 May, at about 01:10, 13 Palestinians, including children and women, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in eastern Deir al Balah.</li>
<li>On 20 May, at about 01:39, 15 Palestinians from the same family, including 11 females (two women and nine others of unconfirmed age), were reportedly killed and others injured when the gas station the family was living in after being displaced was hit in eastern An Nuseirat, in Deir al Balah.</li>
<li>On 20 May, at around midnight, at least 11 people were reportedly killed and several others injured, and some were reported missing, when a house was hit in Jabalya al Balad, in North Gaza. Fatalities included a father, his two sons, his daughter, and his granddaughter.</li>
<li>On May 20, three Palestinians, including two men (brothers) and one woman were reportedly killed and 15 others injured when tents for internally displaced people (IDP) were hit in Al Mawasi area of western Rafah.</li>
<li>On 21 May, at about 11:00, eight Palestinians, including a girl, were reportedly killed and about 60 others were injured when a group of people was hit east of Gaza city.</li>
<li>On 21 May, at about 04:15, at least 13 Palestinians – three married couples and their seven offspring, including five children – were reportedly killed when a residential building was hit and destroyed in Abasan al Kabira, in Khan Younis.</li>
<li>On 22 May, at about 02:26, 10 Palestinians, members of the same family, including three children and three women, were reportedly killed when a warehouse sheltering IDPs was hit in Al Birkeh area of southwestern Deir al Balah.</li>
<li>On 22 May, at about 05:00, at least 16 people of the same family, including 10 children and two women, were reportedly killed when two houses were hit in Jabalya al Balad, in North Gaza.</li>
<li>On 21 May, at about 11:30, 10 Palestinians were reportedly killed and several others injured when a wood-fired oven, functioning as a community bakery, was hit in central Gaza city.</li>
<li>On 26 May, at about 02:15, at least 17 Palestinians including four women, and at least five children, were reportedly killed when a house was hit in eastern Jabalya, in North Gaza.</li>
<li>On 26 May, at about 00:30, about 36 Palestinians, including at least six children and other women, were reportedly killed, with many bodies reportedly severely burned after three classrooms of a school sheltering hundreds of IDPs were hit in Ad Daraj neighbourhood, in eastern Gaza city, causing a massive fire.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-294-gaza-strip">Humanitarian Situation Update #294 | Gaza Strip</a>? Here&rsquo;s a high-level view malnutrition spreading:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The nutritional situation of children continues to deteriorate. According to the Nutrition Cluster, preliminary analysis indicates that out of 46,738 children under five years of age who were screened for malnutrition in the second half of May, 2,733 (5.8 per cent) were diagnosed with acute malnutrition. This is up from 4.7 per cent in the first half of May and almost triple the proportion of children diagnosed with malnutrition out of those screened in February 2025, during the ceasefire. Overall, since January, Nutrition Cluster partners detected and enrolled over 16,500 children under five for treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM), including 141 cases with complications who needed to be hospitalized. Overall, in May, 7.5 per cent of SAM cases needed hospitalization for complications, compared with only three to four per cent in the preceding two months, showing an increase in number of severe cases. Yet, there are currently only four stabilization centres for the treatment of SAM cases with medical complications in the Gaza Strip, including two in Deir al Balah, one in Khan Younis, and one in Gaza city. Stabilization centres in North Gaza and Rafah have been forced to suspend operations, leaving children in these areas without access to lifesaving treatment. Moreover, analysis of available data for pregnant and breastfeeding women (PBW) confirms that there has been a sharp deterioration in their nutritional status in the last two months; in May, acute malnutrition was detected in 17 per cent of screened PBW in Gaza governorate and in 18 per cent of screened PBW in Deir al Balah, compared with less than 10 per cent in these two governorates in February and March.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or do you prefer the day-by-day violence? <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-296-gaza-strip">Humanitarian Situation Update #296 | Gaza Strip</a> has some of that, again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 5 and 9 June, deadly incidents included the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>On 5 June, at about 13:30, nine Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a group of people was hit near Al Shifa tower, northwest of Gaza city.</li>
<li>On 6 June, at about 11:15, a Palestinian female was reportedly killed and several others injured when a school housing internally displaced people (IDPs) was hit in Jabalya Al Balad, in North Gaza.</li>
<li>On 6 June, at about 11:45, at least 10 Palestinians were reportedly killed and several others injured during heavy artillery shelling on Jabalya al Balad, in North Gaza, including residential buildings and an IDPs centre.</li>
<li>On 7 June, at about 14:00, eight Palestinians, including two children, were reportedly killed and others injured when a group of people was hit in Jabalya an Nazlah, in North Gaza.</li>
<li>On 7 June, at about 18:00, six Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when two houses were hit in Jabalya al Balad, in North Gaza.</li>
<li>On 7 June, at about 5:00, seven Palestinians from the same family, including a mother and her four children, were reportedly killed when a residential building was hit in Gaza city.</li>
<li>On 9 June, at about 9:50, six Palestinians including two females were reportedly killed and others injured when an IDP tent was hit in Al Mawasi area in Khan Younis.</li>
<li>Between 1 and 9 June, at least 21 incidents were reported where IDP tents were allegedly hit, resulting in the reported killing of about 73 people and the injury of tens of others.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and think of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to WHO, more than 10,000 patients, including over 4,000 children, remain in urgent need of medical evacuation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If somebody needs reminding of the scale of this bloody revenge, let them read these dry reports.</p>

<p>And for context, Wikipedia is here to help.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Israel%E2%80%93Palestine_crisis">2021 Israel–Palestine crisis</a>: &ldquo;As a result of the violence, at least 256 Palestinians, including 66 children, were killed (including at least seven from friendly fire). In Israel, at least 13 people were killed, including two children. The Gaza Ministry of Health reported that more than 1,900 Palestinians were injured, and as of 12 May, at least 200 Israelis were reported to have been injured. As of 19 May, at least 72,000 Palestinians have been displaced.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War">2014 Gaza War</a>: &ldquo;The war resulted in over two thousand deaths, the vast majority of which were Gazan Palestinians. This includes a total of six Israeli civilians who were killed as a result of the conflict.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Gaza_War">2012 Gaza War</a>: &ldquo;Israel. Civilians: 4 killed, 219 injured. Combatants: 2 killed, 20 wounded. Palestine. Civilians: 105 killed, 971 wounded … Combatants: 55 killed, 29 wounded&rdquo; (claimed, respectively)&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%932009)">Gaza War (2008–2009)</a>: &ldquo;The conflict resulted in 1,166–1,417 Palestinian and 13 Israeli deaths.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba">Nakba</a>: &ldquo;During the foundational events of the Nakba in 1948, approximately half of Palestine&rsquo;s predominantly Arab population, or around 750,000 people, were expelled from their homes or made to flee through various violent means, at first by Zionist paramilitaries, and after the establishment of the State of Israel, by its military. Dozens of massacres targeted Palestinian Arabs and over 500 Arab-majority towns, villages, and urban neighborhoods were depopulated. Many of the settlements were either completely destroyed or repopulated by Jews and given new Hebrew names. Israel employed biological warfare against Palestinians by poisoning village wells. By the end of the war, 78% of the total land area of the former Mandatory Palestine was controlled by Israel.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>And there is more. I&rsquo;ve read a book by Alain Gresh. I&rsquo;ve read a book or two by Noam Chomsky. I&rsquo;ve been reading about Israel and Palestine for a while. I remember when 23-year-old American activist Rachel Corrie was run over by a bulldozer as she stood barring its way (<a href="2003-03-19_Israel">2003-03-19 Israel</a>). I wore T-shirts sold by <a href="https://electronicintifada.net/">The Electronic Initfada</a>.</p>

<p>If I know one thing it&rsquo;s that the situation is very complicated, that human rights are violated every day, and that the response to the violation of human rights is not more violations of human rights.</p>

<p>All should go to court.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The landmark ruling of 19 July 2024 declared that Israel’s occupation of the Gaza strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is unlawful, along with the associated settlement regime, annexation and use of natural resources. The Court added that Israel&rsquo;s legislation and measures violate the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid. The ICJ mandated Israel to end its occupation, dismantle its settlements, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and facilitate the return of displaced people. &ndash; <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/07/experts-hail-icj-declaration-illegality-israels-presence-occupied">Experts hail ICJ declaration on illegality of Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory as “historic” for Palestinians and international law</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just the first paragraph of the alleged crimes of Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that during the relevant time, international humanitarian law related to international armed conflict between Israel and Palestine applied. This is because they are two High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and because Israel occupies at least parts of Palestine. The Chamber also found that the law related to non-international armed conflict applied to the fighting between Israel and Hamas. The Chamber found that the alleged conduct of Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant concerned the activities of Israeli government bodies and the armed forces against the civilian population in Palestine, more specifically civilians in Gaza. It therefore concerned the relationship between two parties to an international armed conflict, as well as the relationship between an occupying power and the population in occupied territory. For these reasons, with regards to war crimes, the Chamber found it appropriate to issue the arrest warrants pursuant to the law of international armed conflict. The Chamber also found that the alleged crimes against humanity were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza. &ndash; <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges">Situation in the State of Palestine: ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I rejects the State of Israel’s challenges to jurisdiction and issues warrants of arrest for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same here, there first paragraph of the alleged crimes of Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With regard to the crimes, the Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that on 7 October 2023, shortly after a large number of rockets triggered the ‘Tzeva Adom’ alarm in several communities in Israel around 6:20-6:30 am, armed men entered these communities, as well as the site of the Supernova festival, a music event with a few thousand participants (‘7 October Operation’). Members of Hamas, notably fighters of the al-Qassam Brigades, carried out mass killings at and/or around the communities of Kfar Aza, Holit, Nir Oz, Be’eri, and Nahal Oz, as well as at the Supernova festival. The attackers, for example, fired at people while they were seeking shelter and threw grenades at them. Hamas fighters followed similar patterns in other locations and killed further persons. These killings qualify as the crime against humanity and the war crime of murder. &ndash; <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-issues-warrant-arrest-mohammed-diab-ibrahim">Situation in the State of Palestine: ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I issues warrant of arrest for Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri (Deif)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put people on trial, respect human rights, roll back the occupation, follow the resolutions of the United Nations. How hard can it be?</p>

<p>Very hard.</p>

<p>You know what&rsquo;s easy? Writing petty emails like these:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s amazing you don’t have blog posts with that tag in October 2023.</p>

<p>It’s amazing you talk about hostages only in context of d&amp;d.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What an amazing big brain mail from a write-only email address. 🙄</p>

## 2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems

date: 2025-06-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-06-16-ban-autonomous-systems">2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems</h1>

<p>More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers, since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter based on IP numbers won&rsquo;t catch them. But if we can determine their autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.</p>

<p>Now, since these hosting providers also host nice things like other fediverse instances, I don&rsquo;t want to block them forever. I want to block them for 10min, and if they continue after a few of these shorter blocks, I want to block them for a week. Hopefully, their clients have ended their Internet slurping and things are back to normal. This is how fail2ban works, but only for individual IP numbers.</p>

<p>I want code that bridges this gap.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p><a href="github.com/WKnak/fail2ban-bloc">fail2ban-bloc</a> tries to guess (!) IP ranges and bans those using fail2ban. I need to investigate more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still fascinated by <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2025-05-30-asncounter/">asncounter</a>. It might even work without logfiles, using <code>tcpdump</code>! For now, it generates an interesting Top 10 list. What&rsquo;s interesting about it is that it doesn&rsquo;t require me to query an external service and leak IP numbers.</p>

<p>I used to have the following fish function, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function asn
    for ip in $argv
        dig +short (string split '.' $ip|tac -|string join '.').origin.asn.cymru.com. TXT
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t want to do is write another tool like <a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">network-lookup-lean</a> which uses <code>asn.routeviews.org</code> for the same purposes, caches results, and so on. I want to get rid of this live lookup.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-asncounter">Working with <code>asncounter</code></h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s me looking at the last Apache log file, excluding my fedi instance:</p>

<p>INIT7 is my Internet service provider at home and NINE is my hosting provider for the server. Better not ban those! 😅</p>

<p>So what is VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp doing? This could use better tool support!</p>

<p>OK, this is bots. Useless random URLs.</p>

<h2 id="ban-all-the-networks-managed-by-an-asn">Ban all the networks managed by an ASN</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use <code>ipset</code> to use two lists, <code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code>.
I use these two for <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>, too.</p>

<pre><code># Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>

<p>To ban all the IP ranges an ASN manages, I created the following little fish function using <code>ip.guide</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[]')
            echo ipset add banlist $cidr
        end
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v6[]')
            echo ipset add banlist6 $cidr
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try it with the ASN 45899!</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

<p>For more about <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> see the comments on <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</a>.</p>

<p>When I ran the <code>asn-ban</code> command above, I noticed that I got a single &ldquo;it&rsquo;s already added&rdquo; response.
Before adding the same numbers to my shell script, therefore:</p>

<pre><code>for cidr in (asn-ban 45899|awk '{print $4}'); if grep -q $cidr bin/admin/ban-cidr; echo $cidr; end; end
</code></pre>

<p>That told me I had to remove <code>14.187.96.0/20</code> from my script. Once this is done:</p>

<pre><code>echo (echo &quot;#&quot;; date --iso)  &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr
asn-ban 45899 &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr 
</code></pre>

<p>I really need to figure out how to manage this smartly. And I need to figure out a way to unban the whole list!</p>

<h2 id="integration-with-fail2ban">Integration with <code>fail2ban</code></h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with <code>fail2ban</code>. I need a jail! Every jail needs a filter!</p>

<p>In <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> (this is where I maintain all my jails) I added:</p>

<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1d
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this jail doesn&rsquo;t define log paths. I hope that works as intended.</p>

<p>I created a matching filter with no definition in <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>

<p>Reload it all, and check:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload
OK
fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:	6
`- Jail list:	alex-apache, alex-bots, butlerian-jihad, ngircd, recidive, sshd
</code></pre>

<p>Nice! So now I have a new jail.</p>

<h2 id="undo-the-banlist">Undo the banlist</h2>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sed 's/ipset add/ipset del/' | sh
</code></pre>

<p>I also manually edited my <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> file to remove the lines I added above. Let&rsquo;s have fail2ban handle this!</p>

<h2 id="switch-from-ipset-to-fail2ban-client">Switch from <code>ipset</code> to <code>fail2ban-client</code></h2>

<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        set --local cidr (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[],.routes.v6[]')
        echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip $cidr
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Examine it:</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | less
</code></pre>

<p>Run it:</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
3640
</code></pre>

<p>If you messed up, clear the jail:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload --unban butlerian-jihad
</code></pre>

<p>Check the jail:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned

<h2 id="what-do-we-have">What do we have?</h2>

<p>With <code>asncounter</code> we have a tool to quickly discover if an ASN is providing services to a bot.</p>

<p>With <code>asn-ban</code> we have a tool to quickly add all the IP networks the ASN is managing to a jail for <code>fail2ban</code>.</p>

<p>The jail which we called <code>butlerian-jihad</code> bans the IP networks for a day.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-left-to-do">What&rsquo;s left to do?</h2>

<p>I should check whether this actually works! Let&rsquo;s see whether the ban gets lifted after 24h. That&rsquo;s the main point of this exercise!</p>

<p><code>asn-ban</code> uses the <code>ip.guide</code> site for the data. This should be rewritten such that it uses the same data as <code>asncounter</code>.
I guess that would be <a href="https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn">pyasn</a>.
See below!</p>

<p>I need a cron job that runs every 10 minutes, takes the last ten minutes worth of Apache access log files, ignores the fedi subdomain, identifies all the ASNs, ignores my own ASNs and bans the rest.</p>

<h2 id="asn-networks-without-an-external-service">ASN networks without an external service</h2>

<p><a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> is a tiny script with a bunch of lines taken from <code>asncounter</code> to print the IP ranges managed by one or more autonomous systems.</p>

<pre><code>python3 asn-ban 209366
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24
85.208.96.0/24
85.208.97.0/24
85.208.99.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>It uses the <code>pyasn</code> datafiles that a regular run of <code>asncounter</code> has downloaded.
That is to say, <code>asn-networks</code> does not download or refresh these files.
I&rsquo;m assuming that you have run <code>asncounter</code> just moments earlier.</p>

<p>Given this script, we can now call <code>fail2ban-client</code> as follows (I use fish) to ban all the networks:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>

<p>Unbanning works the same way:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad unbanip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that <code>fail2ban-client</code> prints the number of IP numbers or ranges added or removed.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-suspicious-asn">Identifying suspicious ASN</h2>

<p>What is suspicious activity? How about this: In a 2h window, no ASN should send more than 1000 requests? So we need a script that filters the log files and prints a 2h window, skipping the lines we want to ignore: <a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>. Then pass the IP numbers to <code>asncounter</code>, throw away all the things we don&rsquo;t care about and just print the appropriate lines:</p>

<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000  { print }'
3062	31.93	24940	HETZNER-AS, DE
1642	17.12	16276	OVH, FR
</code></pre>

<p>So do I dare ban those numbers?? I&rsquo;m not sure!
I should figure out a way to find those 3062 requests made by services hosted on Hetzner.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/asn-access-log">asn-access-log</a> does just that. You pass it an ASN, it determines all the networks it manages and then it filters standard input, assuming that it consists of Apache access log lines (what counts is that the second field is an IP number).</p>

<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social | bin/asn-access-log 24940
</code></pre>

<p>I see a lot of RSS services (NewsBlur, fiperbot, MyNewspaper Agent, FreshRSS), git, some bot (from the 159.69.0.0/16 range, for example), and on and on. Ugh. It&rsquo;s not easy to know what to do!</p>

<p>I think the best answer would be to lower the stakes but also ban for shorter amounts of time and let <code>fail2ban</code> handle the rest. The only thing I need to consider is whether I find the current amount of resources spent OK. Do I? Let&rsquo;s look at the latest numbers.</p>

<p>This here shows that fedi traffic is 60% Hetzner and OVH. This makes it hard for me to block these autonomous systems.</p>

<p>The autonomous systems that show up in the second list but not in the first list are my prime candidates, like COMCAST and CHINAMOBILE-CN.</p>

<p>So how about going after the autonomous systems on the second list that produce more than 1000 hits in a 2h period.</p>

<p>Something like this? I&rsquo;m going to but this into <code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip
</code></pre>

<p>I use <code>ifne</code> to prevent the execution of the command if there is no input.
Thanks, <a class="account" href="https://tilde.zone/@acdw" title="@acdw@tilde.zone">@acdw</a>!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p><code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code> runs every hour and checks if there have been any abusive autonomous systems in the last two hours. If so, they are banned. Note how I&rsquo;ve added my home IPv4 and IPv6 because I use my site a lot. 😅</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 !MY-HOME-IPV4 !MY-HOME-IPV6 \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip \
&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>This drops the output (the number of new bans) because otherwise the cron job mails that number to me.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a> prints the last two hours worth of log lines from <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code> (and <code>access.log.1</code> if necessary).</p>

<p>The <code>!^social</code> argument ensures that connecting to my fedi server doesn&rsquo;t trigger the ban hammer.</p>

<p>The <code>!178.209.50.237</code> argument ensures that I don&rsquo;t ban the server itself as it monitors stuff and as I test things on the server. I also had to add my home IP numbers!</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> finds the autonomous system numbers for all the IP numbers in the web server log file and prints a report.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> then turns the selected autonomous system numbers and returns the IP ranges they manage.</p>

<p>These are then banned by <code>fail2ban-client</code> using the <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.</p>

<p>The <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail is mentioned in enabled via a config file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code>. In my case, the file is called <code>alex.conf</code> and for this jail, it says:</p>

<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h
</code></pre>

<p>The jail also needs a filter definition even though no filtering happens as no logfile is checked.
My <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> contains just this:</p>

<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>

<p>What this means is that every hour, an autonomous system unit can get banned.
If they are banned, they are banned for 1h.
If they are banned for activity in the last hour leading up to the ban, the script will find the same log entries and ban them &ldquo;again&rdquo;. This results in no changes in the jail, since all the networks are already in the <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.</p>

<p>The bans themselves are reported in <code>/etc/log/fail2ban.log</code>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also enabled the <code>recidive</code> jail. That is, in the same file where I defined my <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail, I have:</p>

<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>

<p>The defaults are in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[recidive]

logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.log
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
bantime  = 1w
findtime = 1d
</code></pre>

<p>So if some network is banned for more than five times in a day, it is banned for a week.
I say five times because <code>maxretry</code> is set to 5 in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume a scraper is started from some network managed by an autonomous system. It starts using IP numbers from all its ranges. It sends 600 requests per hour, more than a human could read and more than a feed reader should need, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>after the first hour, nothing happens, as 600 is less than the 1000 needed to trigger the system</li>
<li>after the second hour, the ASN is banned because the sum total for the last two hours is 1200</li>
<li>after the third hour, the ASN is unbanned and not banned again because it only made 600 requests in the second hour</li>
<li>after the fourth hour, the ASN is banned again (1200 requests)</li>
<li>after the fifth hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the sixth hour, the ASN is banned for the third time (1200 requests)</li>
<li>after the seventh hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the eighth hour, the ASN is banned for the fourth time (1200 requests)</li>
<li>after the ninth hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the tenth hour, the ASN is banned for the fifth time (1200 requests)</li>
<li>after the eleventh hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the twelfth hour, the ASN is banned for the sixth time, the <code>recidive</code> filter kicks in and the networks belonging to the ASN are banned for a week</li>
</ul>

<p>This escalation takes twelve hours. The ASN was already banned for half this time.</p>

<p>Assuming this repeats every week, it means that the pattern repeats every 7½ weeks and the abusive ASN still gets service on 6h out of 180h or 3% of the time. For my taste, that is still way too nice.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this goes for a while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already looking forward to dropping my <code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code> sets I created for <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.</p>

<h2 id="aftermath-cleaning-up-ban-cidr">Aftermath: cleaning up <code>ban-cidr</code></h2>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback, no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script full of firewall commands.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</a></p>

<p>Back when I first encountered the distributed AI bot attacks, I wrote <a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</a> and began working on <code>ban-cidr</code>. In later posts, I just automated the work of getting from an IP number to a network range and adding that to the script. Now that I hopefully have an automatic solution where I only need to fine-tune the time-windows and the limits, it&rsquo;s time to expire all those bans. There are currently over 40,000 of these banned networks.</p>

<pre><code>ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | wc -l
46920
ipset list banlist6 | tail -n +9 | wc -l
9
</code></pre>

<p>So slowly, over time, I&rsquo;m planning to remove these.</p>

<pre><code>for ip in (ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | head -n 1000); ipset del banlist $ip; end
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes! 😂</p>

<p>Ugh. They need to go.</p>

<p>First, create the two lists. At this level we need two different lists for IPv4 and IPv6.</p>

<pre><code>ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>

<p>Then define a new version of <code>asn-ban</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function asn-ban
    set --local data (asn-networks --json $argv)
    for asn in $argv
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v4[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist $ip
        end
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v6[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist6 $ip
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the <code>--json</code> option for <a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> so that we only need to call it once and yet we get two lists: one for <code>banlist</code> and one for <code>banlist6</code>.</p>

<p>To ban the offending ASN:</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 55836|sh
</code></pre>

<p>Before I do that, however, I want to finish clearing the existing lists.</p>

<p>The reason I call this petty banning is because I&rsquo;m starting to ban autonomous systems even though their bots are &ldquo;well behaved&rdquo; in as much as they don&rsquo;t exceed the thresholds I defined. And yet they seem to be part of that great parade to honour the CO₂ god, the computation of useless shit.</p>

Highly recommend reading this <a href="https://www.left-horizons.com/2025/06/15/that-military-parade-from-the-trumpland-diary/">review</a> of Trump's parade. We had the wrong idea about what the Army would do. Basically if you order us to do a parade, we will give you a parade.

## The State Of Storage

date: 2025-06-17, from: David Rosenthal's blog

<i>The Register</i> is running a series on <a href="https://www.theregister.com/special_features/the_state_of_storage/"><i>The State Of Storage</i></a>. Below the fold I flag some articles worth reading.<br />
<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<be>
Richard Speed's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/10/retro_storage/"><i>Old but gold: Paper tape and punched cards still getting the job done – just about</i></a> covers the issues hampering efforts to recover data from legacy media:<br />
<blockquote>
A challenge with storage is the longevity of the media and the availability of hardware capable of retrieving it. While paper tape and punch cards are long-lasting and can be read by enterprising enthusiasts of today, modern densely packed SSDs and spinning disks might present more of a challenge for the archivists of tomorrow.
</blockquote>

Chris Mellor's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/12/archival_storage_feature/"><i>Tape, glass, and molecules – the future of archival storage</i></a> looks at the issues I covered in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/archival-storage.html"><i>Archival Storage</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The future of archival data storage is tape, more tape, and then possibly glass-based tech, with DNA and other molecular tech still a distant prospect.<br />
<br />
The function of archival storage is to keep data for the long term – decades and beyond – reliably and affordably. Currently, the main medium for this is LTO tape and it is slow, has a limited life, and not enough capacity considering the implications of ever-increasing image and video resolution and AI-infused data generation. However, there is as yet no viable tape replacement technology at scale, only possibilities, with optical storage more practical and nearer to productization than DNA or other molecular storage.
</blockquote>
Mellor mostly agrees with me, but is more optimistic about Cerabyte's technology than I am. It is less aggressive than Project Silica, writing a single layer of data onto glass tablets. He reports that:<br />
<blockquote>
Cerabyte has attracted investment from In-Q-Tel, Pure Storage, and Western Digital. Shantnu Sharma, WD's Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer, said: "We are looking forward to working with Cerabyte to formulate a technology partnership for the commercialization of this technology."<br />
...<br />
Like Project Silica, it is, in our assessment, two to five years away from commercial product availability, but it will then be commercially available.
</blockquote>
Simon Sharwood's <a herf="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/13/hdd_features/"><i>The trendline doesn’t look good for hard disk drives</i></a> covers the evolution of the hard disk market to its current focus on nearline storage for hyperscalers:<br />
<blockquote>
In early May, independent digital storage analyst Thomas Coughlin <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2025/05/03/c1q-2025-hdd-industry-update/">shared</a> news of falling sales and revenue in the first quarter of 2025, continuing a trend that started in around 2010. Coughlin <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2024/12/06/digital-storage-and-memory-projections-for-2025-part-1/">cites</a> data from that year showing around 600 million annual hard disk shipments.<br />
<br />
In 2025 he thinks around 150 million units will make it out of factory doors.
<br />
Hyperscale datacenter operators will buy most of them and have become HDD manufacturers' largest customers.<br />
...<br />
While HDD volumes fall, collective annual shipped HDD capacity is rising – so even though fewer machines are made, they collectively contain more gigabytes than last year's larger disk fleet.

Chris Mellor's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/09/hamr_100_tb_drive_feature/"><i>Seagate still HAMRing away at the 100 TB disk drive decades later</i></a> recounts the saga of Seagate's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">two-and-a-half decade long</a> effort to get Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording disks into mass production:<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate is currently shipping 30 TB conventionally recorded Exos M HAMR drives and both 32 and 36 TB shingled magnetic recording (SMR) drives. These have blocks of partially overlapping write tracks to increase track density and thus overall capacity, but with a slower rewrite speed as entire blocks of tracks have to be rewritten.<br />
<br />
The company should have a clear drive capacity advantage, but it does not because its HAMR technology has proven extraordinarily difficult to bring into mass production and it has one less platter than competing drives. By 2012, Seagate predicted it could make 1 Tb/in² in HAMR drives after a successful <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/03/20/seagate_terabit_areal_density/">demo</a>. That did not happen but it managed to make 16 TB HAMR drives and was sampling them in 2019. They did not make it to mass production either, and a 20 TB technology was the next development. It too did not last long.<br />
<br />
CEO Dave Mosley told <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/11/20/seagate-ceo-talks-about-big-jumps/">investment analysts in 2020</a> that Seagate was stepping up to 24 TB HAMR drives. By 2023, a 30 TB HAMR drive was said to be coming. This was actually unveiled in <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2024/01/17/seagate-hamr-drives/">January 2024</a>, with the tech branded Mozaic 3+, referring to the 32 and then 36 TB SMR variants.
</blockquote>
Mellor notes the impact this history has had on Seagate's credibilty:<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate has previously made several predictions about HAMR drive availability that were not ultimately achieved. The tech giant appears to have persistently underestimated how long it will take to productize HAMR technology and so reap the production cost benefit of having fewer platters and sliders at any capacity point than its two competitors.

## Where AI Provides Value

date: 2025-06-17, updated: 2025-06-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>If you&#8217;ve worried that AI might take your job, deprive you of your livelihood, or maybe even replace your role in society, it probably feels good to see the latest AI tools fail spectacularly. If AI recommends <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">glue as a pizza topping</a>, then you&#8217;re safe for another day.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that AI already has definite advantages over even the most skilled humans, and knowing where these advantages arise&#8212;and where they don&#8217;t&#8212;will be key to adapting to the AI-infused workforce.</p>
<p>AI will often not be as effective as a human doing the same job. It won&#8217;t always know more or be more accurate. And it definitely won&#8217;t always be fairer or more reliable. But it may still be used whenever it has an advantage over humans in one of four dimensions: speed, scale, scope and sophistication. Understanding these dimensions is the key to understanding AI-human replacement...</p>

## Some media is for relaxation

He's relaxing white noise, chatting in the background while you play a game or write a blog post or text message on your phone, or just think about something unrelated. I forgot that mode of media consumption. I'm always on the hunt for that kind of content. That's why sports games are so good. You can almost completely tune out, knowing they'll replay the best stuff. </p>
<p>Reminds of a meeting we had a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Berkman">Berkman</a> in the early days of podcasting. Most of the faculty were of course not on board with what we were doing, possibly believing that it threatened public radio (didn't turn out that way at all, they made incredibly good use of podcasting). One of the guys from <a href="https://www.prx.org/">PRX</a> which was also incubating there at the time, said at me in a challenging way -- You get the best info from public radio! Right? I thought for a minute and realized this was a good question. No, I said, it's relaxing, I can tune out while I'm driving or walking around town. Loud groans. But it's so true. Now it's great when there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dept._Q">TV series</a> that really <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=disbelief">catches</a> your attention, I love that too, but most of my media-ingesting time is with white noise, background relaxation. The world is still okay when the background noise on MSNBC are still on the air between the ever more disgusting ads for diseases I probably will never get.</p>
<p>There must be a better way. </p>
<p>It's like the canaries in a coalmine. When they go off the air that's when you really have to start worrying! </p>
<p>BTW, PRX was a good idea. Brilliant actually. Distribute the content from the public radio sources that generate too much to the ones in less populated areas where they don't generate enough. Podcasting blew that up -- but PRX adjusted their approach, and became a distributor of podcasting. That's an entrepreneur's approach. The were able to pivot and continue to make a contribution to this day. </p>
<p>I often wonder how we missed the opportunity to build a great media incubator at Harvard in the 00s. We were right there, and the backer of Berkman wanted entrepreurial projects, I found out at the reunion two summers ago. We had it, were there, if only.. Heh when you get to be my age there's lots of that. </p>
<p>Also I wonder how I missed the potential of WordPress all those years. Ships passing in the night. But we're there now, so..</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/15/tacoShells.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I figured that yesterday's army march in DC would have caused clashes with the police in more places than it did, perhaps due to false flag attacks "from the left" at one of the many No King Day parades around the country. I thought this was the moment when it would all melt down. America's Reichstad Fire. If it were an episode of Mission Impossible or Batman, it would definitely have gone that way. I bet there were plans hatched on open chat channels between various Cabinet members and their families, and probably Elon Musk via an interpreter, to coordinate. I was also surprised there weren't any Tesla Cybertrucks in yesterday's parade. I guess the honeymoon is really over. Anyway, they had to have had a plan, but I keep forgetting this is not Generalissimo Trump, rather it's TV President "Taco" Trump. I think they had a plan and he lost his nerve at the last minute. Instead, the Maga in Minnesota lit a different fuse, assassinating the speaker of the state house. That's a line that hadn't yet been crossed, but you knew the day would come. It's here.

When Trump was on trial in NYC he begged for support from his base, no one showed up. The cops prepared for rallies that never showed up.

## Working together

date: 2025-06-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>It's not just the government that's afraid of small groups of people working together. Big tech companies also. And startups hoping to sell out to big companies. </p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/04/butHerEmails.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">If you think we need to find a way past the billionaires, then we have to find a way around the established media. They keep selling us out and we keep acting as if we show them that they're doing it in a way they understand they'll get on our side. But they can't. “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair">wrote</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">Upton Sinclair</a> in 1935. It's still true 90 years later. Another great philosopher, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Moonves">Les Moonves</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/les-moonves-trump-cbs-220001">said</a> in 2016, "It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS," referring to Trump's run for president. It was good presumably because of increased viewership resulting more ad revenue. I'm sure it's still true today, though CBS stopped boasting about it in public.
