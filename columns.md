**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-03-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67dd5fa5d278819192d9fca03485723f-wordland-support">something</a> that could be very useful. A link to ChatGPT with instructions on how to help a user overcome problems using <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. Try clicking the link and see what happens, esp if you're a regular WordLand user. I discovered the feature first by asking if the bot knew what WordLand was, and it said it did, and got it mostly right. I've been using ChatGPT to develop the product, so it's possible it has retained some of the info. And the docs are on the web. This is one of those times when you really want the AI bot to ingest everything they can find. What I'm worried most about are hallucinations. But with a product like WordLand, which could show up problems in the browser or a WordPress theme, a lot of the help requests we get are not problems with WordLand.

## It’s Over

date: 2025-03-20, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

The Voice of America is silent. To Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Kari Lake (who now runs its corpse), the VOA was corrupt, biased, unnecessary, and needed to go. To nearly everyone else who cares, it was America&#8217;s voice on radio, and mattered enormously to an audience in the hundreds of millions, listening in forty-eight [&#8230;]

## How the "socialsphere" shapes up

<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/20/socialsphereProtocolMatrix.png"></center>Product Protocol Support Matrix.</div></p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminology: I don't thnk we should use the term <i>social web</i> until there actually is such a thing, so I invented a new term for these twitter-like services.</li>
<li>Since Ghost is now supporting ActivityPub, I felt we needed to include Substack because the two products compete directly. </li>
<li>I consider AT Proto a proprietary protocol for now, as proprietary as Mastodon's API.</li>
<li>I included WordPress because it supports ActivityPub. </li>
<li>If you want to comment or ask questions I posted this table on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/114196981837796238">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lktoxrxmok2v">Bluesky</a>.</li>

## Critical GitHub Attack

<blockquote><p>A sophisticated cascading supply chain attack has compromised multiple GitHub Actions, exposing critical CI/CD secrets across tens of thousands of repositories. The attack, which originally targeted the widely used “tj-actions/changed-files” utility, is now believed to have originated from an earlier breach of the “reviewdog/action-setup@v1” GitHub Action, according to a report. </p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>CISA confirmed the vulnerability has been patched in version 46.0.1.</p>
<p>Given that the utility is used by more than 23,000 GitHub repositories, the scale of potential impact has raised significant alarm throughout the developer community...</p></blockquote>

## Using ChatGPT for tech support

date: 2025-03-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>If you aren’t sure how to ask for help with software, try first asking ChatGPT or another AI chatbot to help figure out what’s going wrong. It has infinite time to help, and won’t mind if the problem turned out to be a random browser plug-in that was misbehaving.</p>
<p>It often suggests trying things you might not have thought of.</p>
<p>I use it myself esp as often is the case there’s no one who can or is willing to work for me for free. I’m already playing it $20 per month, and for that I get as much time as it takes.</p>
<p>Really good for organizing your approach to a problem.</p>

## 2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working

date: 2025-03-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-20-something-about-the-bot-defence-is-working">2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working</h1>

<p>At midnight, there was a surge in activity.
CPU usage went up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Load went up, too. But it stayed within reasonable bounds &ndash; less than 4 instead of the more than 80 I have seen in the past.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And the number of IP addresses blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> went from 40 to 50.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m usually sceptical of this because the big attacks are from a far wider variety of IP numbers.
In this case, however, maybe there was some probing that resulted in blocks? I don&rsquo;t know. Lucky, I guess?</p>

<p>In any case, the site is still up. Yay for small wins.</p>

<p>Also, I cannot overstate how good it feel to have some <a href="https://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> graphs available.</p>

<p><code>alex-bots</code> is a setup I desribed in <a href="2025-02-19-bots-again">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</a>.
Basically a request to one of my Oddmuse wikis containing the parameter <code>rcidonly</code> is an expensive endpoint: &ldquo;all changes for this single page&rdquo; or &ldquo;a feed for this single page&rdquo;. This is something a human would rarely access and yet it somehow the URLs landed in some dataset for AI training, I suspect. So what I do is I’m redirecting any request containing “rcidonly” in the query string to <code>/nobots</code>, warning humans not to click on these links.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the filter <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> contains this:</p>

<pre><code>[Definition]
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>

<p>And I added a section using this filter to my jail <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>

<p>So if an IP number visits three URLs containing &ldquo;rcidonly&rdquo; in an hour, they get banned for ten minutes.</p>

<p>The <code>recidive</code> filter (a standard filter you just need to activate) then makes sure that any IP number that got blocked three times gets blocked for a week.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-03-20</strong>. Ever since Drew DeVault published his blog post, more people seem to notice what&rsquo;s going on: AI ingestion is killing web sites and web services.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think these crawlers respect <code>robots.txt</code> then you are several assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl everything they can find, <code>robots.txt</code> be damned, including expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit in every repo, and they do so using random User-Agents that overlap with end-users and come from tens of thousands of IP addresses – mostly residential, in unrelated subnets, each one making no more than one HTTP request over any time period we tried to measure – actively and maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user traffic and avoiding attempts to characterize their behavior or block their traffic. &ndash; <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">Please stop externalizing your costs directly into my face</a>, by Drew DeVault, for SourceHut</p>

<p>Then, yesterday morning, KDE GitLab infrastructure was overwhelmed by another AI crawler, with IPs from an Alibaba range; this caused GitLab to be temporarily inaccessible by KDE developers. I then discovered that, one week ago, an Anime girl started appearing on the GNOME GitLab instance, as the page was loaded. It turns out that it&rsquo;s the default loading page for Anubis, a proof-of-work challenger that blocks AI scrapers that are causing outages. &ndash; <a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">FOSS infrastructure is under attack by AI companies</a>, by Niccolò Venerandi, for LibreNews</p>

## Bitcoin's Fee Spikes

date: 2025-03-20, from: David Rosenthal's blog

I've written several times, for example in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/fixed-supply-variable-demand.html"><i>Fixed Supply, Variable Demand</i></a>, about the mechanism that causes the cost of transacting on a blockchain like Bitcoin's to suffer massive spikes at intervals. When no-one wants to transact, fees are low. When everyone does, they are high. Below the fold I look in detail at a typical Bitcoin fee spike.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqNeI1n10DIswkFe_LPs2r-PFetufmpqVEql4rcJEs0gtkSJt_fw26lsui01gHICAs4z79af__ezm-x6u5s1RXMUPsV5i_BhwYM5WDnaQzalB2yT4sfZl-yCRFVgAh3ql9he9atcm7Xb6_TLXXDl7R9XblDRU_UlLRhrjB1NeqS5VuWcyJ5tG8xOT_pdnj/s583/FeePerTransaction.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="341" data-original-width="583" height="117" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqNeI1n10DIswkFe_LPs2r-PFetufmpqVEql4rcJEs0gtkSJt_fw26lsui01gHICAs4z79af__ezm-x6u5s1RXMUPsV5i_BhwYM5WDnaQzalB2yT4sfZl-yCRFVgAh3ql9he9atcm7Xb6_TLXXDl7R9XblDRU_UlLRhrjB1NeqS5VuWcyJ5tG8xOT_pdnj/w200-h117/FeePerTransaction.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/fees-usd-per-transaction">Average Fee</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
The spike that happened on 6<sup>th</sup> June last year was by no means the largest, but it did increase the average fee per transaction by a factor of 20 from the level 3 days earlier, and by a factor of 10 from the level the day before.<br />
<br />
The bar chart shows the average fee per transaction for the period from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 10<sup>th</sup> of June.<br />

Transactions waiting for a mining pool to select them for inclusion in a block are stored in the mempool. Here is a graph of the daily average number of transactions in the mempool for the same period. Note that:<br />
<ul>
<li>The number of pending transactions ramps up and peaks the day before the spike in fees.</li>
<li>The number of pending transactions remains high for the days after the spike in fees.</li>
</ul>

Transactions aren't all created equal, some are bigger than others. So there is a second measure of congestion, the number of bytes in the mempool. The chart shows the daily average byte count of the mempool for the same period. Note that the peak size of the mempool is the day after the fee spike, and number of transactions in the mempool that day is about the same as the preceding and succeeding days.<br />

Bitcoin's block time is targeted at ten seconds, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-limit">and</a>:
<blockquote>
Bitcoin blocks now have a theoretical maximum size of 4 megabytes and a more realistic maximum size of 2 megabytes
</blockquote>
Thus the rate at which transactions are included in blocks is limited to an average of around 7 per second. The chart shows the number of transactions included in a block each day for the same period. Note that the day of the fee spike Bitcoin processed 42% of the average of the three days before and three days after. The variance of the transaction rate is high. For example, on 7<sup>th</sup> September the blockchain processed 76% more transactions than the average of the three following days.<br />

The <a href="https://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a> website's statistics include an estimate of each day's US dollar value of transactions. By dividing this by the number of each day's transactions, we can estimate the average value of the transactions included in blocks each day, giving this chart. Note that the 6<sup>th</sup> June's average was around 2.5 times the average of the previous three days, and nearly 6 times the average of the following three days.<br />

Because the rate at which transactions arrive in the mempool is variable but the rate at which they leave is capped, even transactions with miner fees suffer a variable delay before being included in a block. Miners choose the most profitable transactions to include. This chart shows the median transaction wait time in minutes over the same period. Note that on average they wait about one block time, but that on 6<sup>th</sup> June they waited much less time.<br />

The distribution of wait times is highly skewed, with a long tail of low-value transactions. This chart shows the average wait time for transactions with fees, expressed as a multiple of the median wait time. Note the ramp up in average wait time ratio, peaking the day after the fee spike.<br />
<br />
The ratio between median and average wait times implies that the spike in the average value of transactions on 6<sup>th</sup> June, coming on top of the ramp in transactions waiting in the mempool from 1<sup>st</sup> June, caused a build-up of low-value transactions, which suffered massive delays as the miners chose the transactions with higher value and fees.<br />

Professional bitcoin OTC traders FT Alphaville spoke with see this as an alarming development and one of the drivers of rival cryptocurrency ether’s growing popularity. The views of one trader:<br />
<blockquote>
It definitely tempts people into ether. This is the biggest problem with bitcoin, it’s not just that it’s expensive to transact, it’s <i>uncertain</i> to transact. It’s hard to know if you’ve put enough of a fee. So if you significantly over pay to get in, even then it’s not guaranteed. There are a lot of people who don’t know how to set their fees, and it takes hours to confirm transactions. It’s a bad system and no one has any solutions.
</blockquote>
Transactions which fail to get the attention of miners sit in limbo until they drop out. But the suspended state leaves payers entirely helpless. They can’t risk resending the transaction, in case the original one does clear eventually. They can’t recall the original one either. Our source says he’s had a significant sized transaction waiting to be settled for two weeks.

Almost 8 years later these problems remain.<br />

So Twitter made subscription one click. And RSS made sites include 25 buttons to give people one-click subscription in every popular feed reader. Twitter only needed one button. And it worked every time. Now, 18 years later, the twitter-like systems world, Mastodon, Threads, Substack, Ghost, Bluesky, etc mostly can't get together on a simple way to peer. They keep talking about it and while they do, we're losing everything that's important to us. In the open tech world we have the same problem as the Democratic Party and the same problem RSS had. We refuse to see how the world has changed, and our slow and steady approach leads nowhere fast. We can't all be masters of our own silo'd domain. We need a web for words that's simple and can be learned in an afternoon, but doesn't lose the essential features writers need. I don't know what we need to win, but I do know what we need to get started.

I like <a href="https://jeffcnichols.net/2025/03/20/the-writers-web-aka-blogging/">Jeff Nichols' piece</a>, but I don't agree that <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">the writer's web</a> is blogging. I think it's bigger. Blogging is <i>part</i> of the writer's web. Today's writing network is much more powerful, the software tools are stronger, and new UI standards have evolved. Things like Digital Ocean, Markdown, Font-Awesome and Node.js didn't exist last time we took a serious look at writing on the web. The web with all its features is still here. WordPress has created a strong foundation to build on, at least as good as the social media platforms, but better because it's of the web, with <i>no limits. </i>We've got the beginning of a new platform, one where developers compete to create great writing and reading environments, and we don't need federation because the web takes care of that.

The basic thing about tech is that attracts people who take things that don't belong to them. There's no policing. The richest people are the ones who are best at grabbing control of other people's creations. That's the common theme. Now they're in DC, going for all of it. The whole thing. But they're like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0">dog that catches the car</a>. They don't have the slightest idea what to do with what they're taking. How could they?

## 2025-03-19 Grounding myself

date: 2025-03-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-19-grounding-myself">2025-03-19 Grounding myself</h1>

<p>The powerlessness when reading the news makes me think that perhaps I need to read even less news, shut it all out.</p>

<p>I also find a new appreciation for all of my ancestors who bore children and raised them even though their world seems like a hellscape compared to what I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wish I could just go to church and sing and pray and it would all be good again. Except it don&rsquo;t believe in it.</p>

<p>So all I have is plants and animals to care for. In a somewhat unhealthy (?) relationship with life around me I find that I put plants where they need me to water them, and find solace in the fact that they at least are unperturbed by everything and are just happy for me to be there and tend them. It feels a bit like an artificial dependent relationship so I dunno, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>

<p>When I see happy dogs and their owners I keep thinking that a dog that&rsquo;s so happy to see me, to fetch that ball, to for that walk, this happiness is real, and they are grounded in life and the present moment.</p>

<p>I want back this ignorant bliss of childhood, some days.</p>

<p>I have no illusions. While I grew up, Iran and Iraq were at war; the Moçambique and Angolan wars of independence turned into civil wars; Yugoslavia fell apart in civil war. Those are the conflicts I remember, in any case.
Life and the news wasn&rsquo;t great. I just didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

## Chimera Linux ghosts RISC-V because there's no time for sluggish hardware

The <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/85bc99f9dc055b220c43a6cde4aa6415">data behind</a> a <a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/16/blogging-is-due-for-a-refresh/">WordLand blog post</a> I wrote a few days ago. I'm publishing these so people get an idea of the structures we're working with. It's basically a WordPress post with added metadata. They have these kinds of structures in RSS, Atom, ActivityPub and AT Proto. Eventually some of these will die out, there are too many formats to support. At any moment in time it feels like each one is enormous and permanent. But show me where the new OS/2, Novell, UCSD Pascal or CP/M apps are. Go back far enough, Alogol, Smalltalk, Lisp, Simula. I am very much a less-is-more type protocol designer, don't try to plan for things you don't have a working model of, because the ideas you gain when you actually put the app together will work much better. And only add things you're willing to live with forever. Slow down to hurry up. Etc. Anyway, <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/85bc99f9dc055b220c43a6cde4aa6415">this</a> is the format we work with inside <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, and more important, in the new APIs, that build on and simplify the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpcom">excellent API</a> that Automattic had already produced.

## Enshittification as a matter of taste

date: 2025-03-19, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>“Enshittification” is a termed coined by Cory Doctorow in 2023 to describe a pattern of decreasing quality observed in online services and products. Since Doctorow’s post, there’s been no shortage of think pieces on enshittification and its role in our society and to a large extent I agree with them all. I think it’s an inevitable problem that shows the splitting seams of Capitalism. If you will allow, I’d like to add a tangential thought – one slight embellishment – to this topic.</p>
<p>To me, enshittification means that a person who lacks taste was put in a position of power.</p>
<p>Everyone knows ads on the internet suck. But ads also pay bills and help keep the lights on in newsrooms. When a website adds one (privacy-preserving) ad to a website, I say “Okay”. Two, I permit it. Three, I say “Easy now” but still scroll through unencumbered. But when the website adds a fifth, seventh, twelfth ad… I know a person who lacks taste is at the wheel. I can feel it in my bones when an app or website has prioritized revenue over user experience. A person without taste or high emotional intelligence broke the unspoken contract we had built on mutual respect.</p>
<p>When you read about the development of the iPhone in books like Ken Kocienda’s <em>Creative Selection</em> or Tony Fadell’s <em>Build</em>,  you understand Steve Jobs’ superpower wasn’t so much that he possessed a reality distortion field, but that he was a great editor. He could find the good ideas in a pile of prototypes and say “no” (harshly, I’ve read) to the less-than-great ideas. You need a person with taste in the decision making process. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">When we see giants falter</a>, it’s a lack of taste shining through.</p>
<p>Going forward, I think taste and style are more valuable than ever before. In an era where we’re able to rapidly generate cheap low quality content or software at a scale we’ve never seen before, <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/elizabeth-goodspeed-column-taste-technology-art-280224">we will need people with taste in the mix</a>. We’ll need aggregators to dive in the dumpsters for the treasure. We’ll need people who know how to zig when everyone is using the Zag-o-tron 9000. We’ll need people who can offer critique and say “no” when the “<a href="https://derekkedziora.com/notes/2024-12-11-an-llms-not-going-to-tell-you-no">yes yes always more</a>” machine barrels through town and begins knocking down institutions.</p>

## 2025-03-15 New window manager: niri

date: 2025-03-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-15-new-window-manager-niri">2025-03-15 New window manager: niri</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m giving <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri">niri</a> a go.
The idea is that a scrollable tiling window manager
(&ldquo;Wayland compositor&rdquo;) is a better fit than just a tiling window manager.
For tiling window managers, I just create new stuff and have it maximized.
I really can&rsquo;t do the quick splitting and rearranging that it seems to afford.
The result is that I start moving stuff to other workspaces, where they&rsquo;re
invisible and gone.
I&rsquo;m hoping that new windows popping up next to existing windows makes it feel
like a stack.</p>

<p>Having gone through the config file and having made a few small changes it
already feels pretty nice. Right now one of the problems I have is that
by sheer bad luck I decided to rotate my external monitor by 90° and that
doesn&rsquo;t work quite as well, maybe? I&rsquo;m not sure. One of the first changes
I did was change the default widths from ⅓ / ½ / ⅔ to 0.95 / ⅔ / ½ with 0.95 being
the default.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Window_Managers">#Window Managers</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Niri">#Niri</a></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t find a solution for Gimp. And I already had no solution for VASSAL under Sway. So for these applications, I still have Gnome installed.</p>

<p>Currently my <code>~/.config/fish/conf.d/window-manager.fish</code> says:</p>

<pre><code># If running from tty1 start sway
set TTY (tty)
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec sway
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec startx
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty3&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec niri
</code></pre>

<p>Oh well. 😅</p>

<p><strong>2025-03-19</strong>. I&rsquo;m finding that there were too many problems with apps that didn&rsquo;t work or had very slow startup times. So I&rsquo;m back to <a href="2023-10-22-sway">using Sway</a>.</p>

## John Palfrey on the moment

date: 2025-03-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is like that moment, five years ago, when we realized that Covid was going to kill a lot of us but it hadn't happened yet. A lot of people weren't yet aware. My <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/02/palfrey2003.jpeg">friend</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey">John Palfrey</a>, who is a legal scholar, has been writing about this moment on LinkedIn and Facebook. Things are flashing by very quickly, so I'm going to publish his latest piece here, below, so it gets a chance to get to the places I'm hooked into.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lawyer friends and non-lawyer friends: has it become hard to say out loud in public: "we believe in the rule of law in America"? That seems not remotely controversial as a concept. The relative quiet on this topic is what is striking me most at the moment.</li>
<li>It would be a good idea for our Republic to avoid sleepwalking through a Constitutional crisis. Of course there are extremely talented lawyers working overtime on many fronts. Those who are not directly involved in litigation have other tools, including voice and funding and organizing, to make plain the simple truth that we should not let the rule of law slip away in America bit by bit. That will continue to happen if the rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with impunity.</li>
<li>If the legislature has abdicated its role in checking the power of the executive, and then the judicial branch is also out, well, that leaves just one. This is not "fancy law stuff". This is "4th grade civics stuff" -- separation of powers, checks and balances (I know, I know, we don't teach civics enough in America...).</li>
<li>It is actually *not* more complicated than that. It can't be that hard to say out loud: "we value the rule of law in America" -- no matter your politics or party.</li>
</ul>

## Is Security Human Factors Research Skewed Towards Western Ideas and Habits?

date: 2025-03-18, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Really interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/hasegawa">How WEIRD is Usable Privacy and Security Research?</a>&#8221; by  Ayako A. Hasegawa Daisuke Inoue, and Mitsuaki Akiyama:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: In human factor fields such as human-computer interaction (HCI) and psychology, researchers have been concerned that participants mostly come from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries. This WEIRD skew may hinder understanding of diverse populations and their cultural differences. The usable privacy and security (UPS) field has inherited many research methodologies from research on human factor fields. We conducted a literature review to understand the extent to which participant samples in UPS papers were from WEIRD countries and the characteristics of the methodologies and research topics in each user study recruiting Western or non-Western participants. We found that the skew toward WEIRD countries in UPS is greater than that in HCI. Geographic and linguistic barriers in the study methods and recruitment methods may cause researchers to conduct user studies locally. In addition, many papers did not report participant demographics, which could hinder the replication of the reported studies, leading to low reproducibility. To improve geographic diversity, we provide the suggestions including facilitate replication studies, address geographic and linguistic issues of study/recruitment methods, and facilitate research on the topics for non-WEIRD populations...</p></blockquote>

## Big Ideas for Little Philosophers

date: 2025-03-18, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>About a month ago, <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2025/02/indies-first-library-trip.html" title="Blog post from 15 Feb: Indie&#39;s First Library Trip">I mentioned</a> that we&rsquo;d borrowed a book from this &ldquo;Big Ideas for Little Philosophers&rdquo; series called <cite>Love with Plato</cite>. Even though I made fun of it at the time, it actually struck me as a really nice little book, and since I was curious about what they would say about the other philosophers, I shelled out to order the whole series:</p>

  loading="lazy" class="u-photo"></a>

</div>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to be able to offer a <em>positive</em> baby book review. While I don&rsquo;t think the books in this series have all accurately outlined the core theses of their respective philosophers, they <em>are</em> all really good, thoughtful books that invite kids to grapple with questions about how we can be good and happy people.</p>
<p>I mentioned last time that I wished the library had had <cite>Equality with Simone de Beauvoir</cite>, and that <em>is</em> one of my favourites, now that I&rsquo;ve read it. It explains, in very &ldquo;small child&rdquo;-friendly language, that gender stereotypes are completely artificial, that girls and boys are really much the same (we all cry when we&rsquo;re sad, and smile when we&rsquo;re happy&hellip;), and that everyone is happier when we can be our true selves without judgement. On one page there is also a cute cat rockin&rsquo; out with a walkman and a hula hoop in the corner, so the book gets bonus points for that.</p>
<p>But then the one that really surprised me was <cite>Happiness with Aristotle</cite>, which actually got into a deep rumination on friendship and what it means to be a &ldquo;true friend&rdquo; that I think many adults would benefit from reading. It talks about how some friends make you laugh and feel good to spend time with, and other friends will help you out when you need a hand, but a <em>true</em> friend is actually someone who&rsquo;ll call you out on your shit, so you can grow as a person. (Again, in kid-friendly language.) Not only that, but the book added that before you can be a &ldquo;true friend&rdquo; to others, you need to be a &ldquo;true friend&rdquo; to yourself, which means &ldquo;loving yourself as much as you love your friends&rdquo;. Like… damn! Where was this book when I was 18–19 and stuck in &ldquo;I can fix him!&rdquo; thinking? It&rsquo;s so good! Again, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s an accurate description of the very core of Aristotelian philosophy, but it&rsquo;s a great message.</p>
<p>The books are board books (you know, the hard cardboard ones usually intended for real babies), but they&rsquo;re full of open-ended questions to elicit discussion with a small child. I would love to read these with Indie when she&rsquo;s, like, five and actually able to engage with the ideas therein. I&rsquo;m glad to have bought our own copies, because I think we&rsquo;ll get a lot of mileage out of them.</p>
<p>Having said this, the series <strong>is</strong> clearly missing a book about one very important philosopher, one they could call something like <cite>Communism with Marx</cite>. I guess we just can&rsquo;t have it all 😔</p>

## Improvements in Brute Force Attacks

date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>New paper: &#8220;<a href="https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/12078/11919">GPU Assisted Brute Force Cryptanalysis of GPRS, GSM, RFID, and TETRA: Brute Force Cryptanalysis of KASUMI, SPECK, and TEA3</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Key lengths in symmetric cryptography are determined with respect to the brute force attacks with current technology. While nowadays at least 128-bit keys are recommended, there are many standards and real-world applications that use shorter keys. In order to estimate the actual threat imposed by using those short keys, precise estimates for attacks are crucial.</p>
<p>In this work we provide optimized implementations of several widely used algorithms on GPUs, leading to interesting insights on the cost of brute force attacks on several real-word applications...</p></blockquote>

<p>A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at blogging. A few items, as examples.</p>
<ol>
<li>When RSS came along Markdown didn't exist. The two technologies belong together, imho.</li>
<li>Websockets have replaced long polling. </li>
<li>Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).</li>
<li>SQL is fast and the tools are much better.</li>
<li>The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn't exist last time we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from  twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.</li>
</ol>
<p>But one thing stays the same -- all the components are replaceable. Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist, and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don't.</p>
<p>Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant. </p>

## 2025-03-16 Klingnauer Stausee

<h1 id="2025-03-16-klingnauer-stausee">2025-03-16 Klingnauer Stausee</h1>

<p>We walked around the lake, me, my wife, my stepmother and her partner. It was late 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic was ongoing. I remember having masks on the train and only taking them off as we were walking around the lake.</p>

## WordLand v0.50

date: 2025-03-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxdv5PveIDM">Adding and deleting categories</a> are part of <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> 0.50, released earlier today. These are the same categories you can edit in the WordPress user interface. But I learned that you need to be able to add categories when you're writing. You want this functionality to be close-by. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/16/twoColumnScreenShot.png">Two columns</a> in the Categories dialog. More efficient use of space.</p>

## ★ A Postscript on the Singular Nature of Mark Gurman’s Reporting

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Daring Fireball

But I’d feel a lot better about our collective conventional wisdom regarding the nature of this particular all-hands Siri meeting if it had leaked to, and been reported on, by more than one reporter at more than one publication.
