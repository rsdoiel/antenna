## Do a backup now

date: 2025-06-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Advice from a longtime developer. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you think "I should do a backup," do it. Now, don't wait. </li>
<li>Make it really easy to do a backup. Choose a menu item that's always available when you're working.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason is karma. God hears all your thoughts. When that thought pops into your head and you don't do a backup, or don't do it soon enough, He crashes your data, and you think "I should have done a backup when I thought of doing it." Even this doesn't please Him. At that moment it's even more urgent that you do a backup. </p>
<p>My hippie uncle taught me this. God has a terrible sense of humor, and thinks it's really funny when you have a good thought and ignore it. When something didn't work he would say that's God goofing on me. </p>
<p>In this case, we're talking about is the Programmer God. There are all kinds of gods, a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html">baseball god</a>, a basketball god, and very specifically a Knicks god. That god has the absolutely worst sense of humor of them all and by worst I mean best. </p>

Another <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/322#issuecomment-3018828658">criticism</a> of the Bluesky API. They make each developer do the support for Open Graph metadata, when it would be much more efficient for them to support it on their end. I would be happy to give them the code. It's not that complicated. But translating the OG format, which for crying out loud is a huge standard, into their arcane format which is only supported by Bluesky, is going in the wrong direction, and frankly is ridiculously arrogant. Show a little humility. Facebook is huge, and the format isn't just used by Facebook, everyone uses it.

I thought I'd set it up first thing Monday morning (ie now) but it <a href="https://www.yubico.com/setup/">turns out</a> it's a major undertaking? Why does this have to be so hard? I guess I'll find out, but not today. I want to make some progress on my development project first. Maybe later.

## How Cybersecurity Fears Affect Confidence in Voting Systems

date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>American democracy runs on trust, and that trust is cracking.</p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, question whether elections are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651185/partisan-split-election-integrity-gets-even-wider.aspx">conducted fairly</a>. Some voters accept election results only <a href="https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/rule-law-united-states">when their side wins</a>. The problem isn&#8217;t just political polarization&#8212;it&#8217;s a creeping <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/10/29/elections-in-america-concerns-over-security-divisions-over-expanding-access-to-voting/">erosion of trust</a> in the machinery of democracy itself.</p>
<p>Commentators blame ideological tribalism, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/business/media/election-disinformation-2024.html">misinformation campaigns</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/opinion/social-media-polarization-democracy.html">partisan echo chambers</a> for this crisis of trust. But these explanations miss a critical piece of the puzzle: a growing unease with the digital infrastructure that now underpins nearly every aspect of how Americans vote...</p>

## A tough place to govern

date: 2025-06-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminwittes.lawfaremedia.org/post/3lsrm5apzpk27">Benjamin Wittes</a>: "It’s remarkable how many non-New Yorkers seem to care who the mayor of New York City is." </p>
<p>They do and they're right to, the same way we were concerned how the Governor of California and Mayor of Los Angeles would react to the invasion of the Marines and hijacking of the National Guard. </p>
<p>Right now the NYC mayor is a hostage of the US govt. Not in a position to help. An inexperienced first term NY mayor, have we seen that before? How does the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io7hOfnMldY">NYPD respond</a> to that? </p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="https://www.newyorkalmanack.com/2019/01/lindsays-snowstorm-a-rising-star-falls-to-earth-in-queens/">snowstorm</a> that derailed John V Lindsay, a heroic and transformative mayor. NY is a tough place to govern even when the US government isn't aiming to regime change the place.</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/29/mayorBeame.png"></center>NY is a tough place to govern even when the US government isn't aiming to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regime_change">regime change</a> the place.</div></p>
<p>Local government is our last line of defense. </p>
<p>"Think of voting as a chess move, not a valentine."</p>
<p>You all <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-2000-election-unleashed-disaster-on-the-world-we-cant-let-that-happen-again-in-2016/">fell in love</a> with a candidate, I do it too. </p>
<p>But think about the context the next mayor will govern in.</p>
<p>The thing about NY that people might not understand is that the politics are dirty and fucked up. Dems tend to elect handsome young heros who when they have to deal with NYPD and the sanitation workers, the teachers union, and the federal government, also the ancient infrastructure, melt.</p>

## The best job in the world

date: 2025-06-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Now that we know the outcome of the 2024 election, not just in numbers but in what it's doing to our beloved country and the rest of the world, it's interesting to revisit the campaign that journalism ran last year to force President Biden to step aside. That's one of the functions of Facebook, they play back your posts from years ago, so you can see how things changed, or didn't. </p>
<p>Anyway, last year on this day I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0254HASiWbtuPTJvn29xiHUgPDUuS4yqHfQwtLHMn9xPADiTbqkyY6KauyCGn58o69l">wrote this</a> on Facebook: "Why don't journalists cover the Biden base? Do they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think they are the base? I thought they weren't supposed to care who the nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this through?"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B06VVR3DX6/about?ccs_id=add77910-b4f6-4323-80d0-494d4da9650f">Nick Arnett</a>, a former tech journalist, said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0254HASiWbtuPTJvn29xiHUgPDUuS4yqHfQwtLHMn9xPADiTbqkyY6KauyCGn58o69l?comment_id=399566229765683">comment</a>: "Until I read this, the madness of the Times calling on Biden, but not Trump, to withdraw didn't dawn on me." </p>
<p>I had followed his metamorphosis over years from a journalist to a worker who goes where there are fires or other natural disasters, for the government, to support the effort to save people's homes and lives. I watched him via Facebook, in awe, as he went around the country, <s>not being paid very much I imagine, but</s> doing good. </p>
<p>I learned something important when my father was in the hospital many years ago, in a coma, after losing a lot of blood and being unconscious for hours before he was found. He was in a ward in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_Hospital_Medical_Center">Flushing Hospital</a>, along with a lot of other comatose people. All were unconscious, unable to feed themselves. Hard to know if they had any awareness. From an outside perspective they, and my father included, were lost. Some had been there for years, probably weren't ever going to come out of it. We were lucky, my father survived, after a month, and had seven more years to live.  </p>
<p>I visited him every day, and got to know the flow of the hospital. Workers came in and out of the room to attend to these comatose people. Imagine the kind of support they needed just to keep their bodies functioning and not wasting away for lack of movement. I thought these people must have the worst jobs imaginable, imagining myself in their shoes.</p>
<p>I got to know them, asked about what else they do, how they got here, where they live, etc. Somehow I got up the courage to ask one of them if they liked their job, imagining I'd get a New Yorker comment like "You know, it's a living." But what I heard was a complete surprise. "It's the best job in the world," he said, because I can see so clearly how my work helps real people. He was looking right at me. It hit me, this man is doing what I can't do, what my father's parents, who were long gone, couldn't do. <i>Caring.</i> Caring for my dad. Then I got it.  </p>
<p>Back to Nick, who was and still is, and probably always will be doing things to help other people, no matter what he does. </p>
<p>He was canned in one of the DOGE purges this spring. </p>
<p>Now you tell me whether the "Trump base" deserved a chance you wouldn't let us have with Biden? Why journalism felt entitled to make this decision for all of us? When are you going to get the idea that you're supposed to help us. Do the right thing. I get so angry at journalism for getting in the way. Once informed of the facts, it was their job to get out of the way and let us, the voters, make the decision. </p>
<p>PS: In the very next post on FB, I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02nENpETJNZ48ZKVGmL8ZRpjrFWPjejG3jQAiJkqL4ofqhYNHvdQBPVaEaNQj2Anuyl">wrote</a> an <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/29/nytPleaseStayInYourFuckingLane.png">HTML hack</a> that makes the same point, more concisely. </p>
