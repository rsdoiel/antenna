## Code Written with AI Assistants Is Less Secure

date: 2024-01-17, updated: 2024-01-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI&#8217;s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants&#8217; language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</p></blockquote>

## Update: The Family Who Died at Eagle Pass

date: 2024-01-17, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Often lost in the gamesmanship of border politics are details of those who tragically die trying to get to this country. In 2022, the most recent year for which records are available, nearly 700 people perished or disappeared trying to come to the United States. The International Organization for Migration says this is the deadliest land route for migrants worldwide.

## Why Trump ran away with Iowa

date: 2024-01-16, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, The mainstream media still don&#8217;t get it. This morning&#8217;s New York Times tried to describe it and utterly failed: &#8220;Donald J. Trump&#8217;s decisive victory in Iowa revealed a new depth to the reservoir of devotion inside his party. For eight years, he has nurtured a relationship with his supporters with little precedent in politics. He validates them, he entertains them, he speaks for them and he uses them for his political and legal advantage.

## Vision Pro’s Long Shadow Over A Boring CES 2024

date: 2024-01-15, from: Om Malik blog

CES 2024, unlike its predecessors, lacked the usual impact&#160;because&#160;tech companies now&#160;prefer&#160;their own events for product releases.&#160;This&#160;was an in-between year, and no one knew what to build, or whom to copy.
