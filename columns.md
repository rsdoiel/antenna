## 2025-05-13 Opatija, Crikvenica

date: 2025-05-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica">2025-05-13 Opatija, Crikvenica</h1>

<p>We stopped in Opatija. The settlement along a lake along a steep hill reminded me of Lausanne or Neufch√¢tel in Switzerland. There were hollow ruins as well as fancy new Grand Hotels, some with an ancient Viennese flair. To me, that‚Äôs weird. To chase the colonised past for tourism cash? ü´§ Didn‚Äôt the Austrians use Croatian troops to out down Italian revolts and the like? Well, after the Austro-Hungarian empire fell apart, the Italians took over Opatija but then the communists pushed them ought.</p>

<p>Visiting former Yugoslavia is dreadful from a history perspective because when I was a teenager the civil war and the breakup of the country was always there, in the back of my mind. Watching <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_(1999_TV_series)">Warriors</a> many years later was the worst, though.</p>

<p>Hearing so many Austrians on the streets is weird.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica-1.jpg" alt="a very traditional hotel by the sea" /></p>

<p>Statue of young women looking at the sea ‚Äì sounds like a meme.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica-2.jpg" alt="statue of a woman on a rock, looking to the sea" /></p>

<p>The natural rocks are supplemented by artificial structures. No sand, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica-3.jpg" alt="many stoneworks project out into the sea for people to lie on" /></p>

<p>Claudia supporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_Krle%C5%BEa">Miroslav Krle≈æa</a>, whom we do not know.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica-4.jpg" alt="a statue of a bulky man leaning dangerously to the side, apparently supported by Claudia" /></p>

<p>The feeling when you need some water and you imagine ice cold sparkling water. üòç</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica-5.jpg" alt="a glass of cold water" /></p>

<p>Claudia also decided to contribute some pictures, seeing how I hadn‚Äôt noticed that the lens had gotten smeared with sun lotion.</p>

<p>We had parked the car in the parking lot of a crumbling hotel ruin.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica-9.jpg" alt="Alex in front of the sea" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica-10.jpg" alt="Claudia in front of the hotel" />

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica-12.jpg" alt="The original harbor from 1900 or so, still in use, for a handful of tiny boats" /></p>

<p>Crikvenica is very different, with sand beaches, many caf√©s, pizzerias and ice-cream parlours. And everything is so green.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica-6.jpg" alt="the sea is visible behind the trees" /></p>

<p>Weicher Akanthus.
Acanthus mollis</p>

<p>And another sunset. üòç</p>

## 2025-05-11 Novigrad, Rovinj, Poreƒç

date: 2025-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-11-novigrad-rovinj-poreƒç">2025-05-11 Novigrad, Rovinj, Poreƒç</h1>

<p>We‚Äôre spending a few days in Croatia. We took the plane to Zagreb, got a rental car and drove west to Istria. Our first station is Novigrad. The reputation for fabulous sunsets is well deserved.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-1.jpg" alt="a propeller on an airplane" /></p>

<p>First stop on the autobahn. Pistachio baklava and Apfelstrudel, coffe and sparkling water.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-2.jpg" alt="Strudel, baklava, coffee and sparkling water" /></p>

<p>Many hours later we finally arrived.
Claudia does all the driving.
I‚Äôm happy to see she‚Äôs still smiling.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-3.jpg" alt="Alex" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-4.jpg" alt="Claudia" /></p>

<p>In May, everything is still offseason.
The sunset is wonderful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-5.jpg" alt="Sunset" /></p>

<p>The next day, we take a walk around town.
There are pools cut into the stoneworks.
But in May, I don‚Äôt feel like taking a bath.
We saw a handful of people swimming, however.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-6.jpg" alt="A flagstone waterfront with two small round pools cut out" /></p>

<p>We looked at the Loƒëa Belveder.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-7.jpg" alt="Alex sitting on a bench in a viewpoint" /></p>

<p>And then we found one of these colourful umbrella passages popular all over the world.
I mean, it‚Äôs nice to have colourful shade.
I‚Äôm not sure we need to use functional umbrellas for it.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-8.jpg" alt="A street with ropes up above, with caught up umbrellas casting a colourful shade" /></p>

<p>In the early afternoon we drove to Rovinj and jogged around.
The houses of the old town are built right to the water‚Äôs edge.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-9.jpg" alt="An old town with a tower" /></p>

<p>Because the picture above was taken against the sun, we decided to cross the isthmus and take a picture with the sun in our back. It wasn‚Äôt much better, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-10.jpg" alt="The same old town from another angle" /></p>

<p>We decided to get up onto the hill.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-11.jpg" alt="Alex on some easy stairs, in shorts and with a red t-shirt" /></p>

<p>On the way back we noticed little alleys going straight up or straight down towards the water.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-12.jpg" alt="Alex on some very steep stairs" /></p>

<p>Nice old cobblestone roads.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-13.jpg" alt="Narrow alleys with cobblestone roads" /></p>

<p>On the way out, we found a tree with pink flowers. üòç</p>

Cercis siliquastrum</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-14.jpg" alt="Pink flowers on a tree" /></p>

<p>We decided to drive back via Poreƒç.
Again, we jogged through town.
We saw two towers with rooftops.
This one seemed to be open.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-15.jpg" alt="Alex on a square with a three story round tower visible in the back" /></p>

<p>And it was open! We had something to drink.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-16.jpg" alt="Alex making a selfie" /></p>

<p>On the way back we decided to look at the outside of the city wall. And it was full of flowers.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-17.jpg" alt="Old walls, old houses, pink flowers, nesting oidgeons" /></p>

<p>So beautiful! üòç</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-18.jpg" alt="Pink flowers growing out of the wall" /></p>

<p>So very beautiful! üòç</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-19.jpg" alt="More pink flowers growing out of the wall" /></p>

<p>You know I can‚Äôt help myself.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-20.jpg" alt="Blue flowers" /></p>

<p>We returned to Novigrad and had dinner by the sea.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-21.jpg" alt="Claudia sitting at a table" /></p>

<p>The sunset was, once again, beautiful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-22.jpg" alt="Yellow flowers" /></p>

<p>That park at the corner has a bunch of trees with hundreds of starlings coming home to sleep. They talk to each other and it‚Äôs the most fascinating murmuring.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-23.jpg" alt="Alex listening to the starlings" /></p>

<p>When you watched closely, the round shadows in the lower part of the tree were pine cones but at the top the round shadows moved around. These were innumerable birds trying to find a place to sleep next to each other. üòç</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-24.jpg" alt="Tree silhouette against the sunset" /></p>

<p>We sat under the trees but it was getting cold.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-25.jpg" alt="Tree silhouette and Alex sitting on the wall against the sunset" /></p>

<p>This walk was beautiful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-26.jpg" alt="The marina area again with the pools, late in the evening" /></p>

<p>The sunset was, again, fantastic.</p>

## 2025-05-12 Novigrad ‚Äì Dajla

date: 2025-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-12-novigrad-dajla">2025-05-12 Novigrad ‚Äì Dajla</h1>

<p>Today was a no-car day. Yay! We got up, had breakfast, went for a walk, came back, and went for a slow 16km jog along the coast, with a stop for water and palaƒçinke (cr√™pes). So nice!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-1.jpg" alt="a screenshot of a map with our route" /></p>

<p>A jasmine closeup.
Or so I thought. The smell was so strong.
But then again, it didn‚Äôt quite look like the jasmin I saw in Thailand. And Flora Incognita says:</p>

<p>Chinesischer Klebsame<br>
Pittosporum tobira</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-2.jpg" alt="white flowers" /></p>

<p>Looks like cloves I thought. Stand amidst some clover, I thought. But the app says:</p>

<p>Gegliederter Sauerklee<br>
Oxalis articulata</p>

<p>What? Learning new thin gs every day!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-3.jpg" alt="pink flowers with leaves consisting of three parts" /></p>

<p>On the run, along some olive trees‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-4.jpg" alt="olive trees" /></p>

<p>On and on‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-8.jpg" alt="I‚Äôm wearing a hat against the sun" /></p>

<p>The beach is always stony, never sandy.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-11.jpg" alt="pine trees on the coast" /></p>

<p>The trail took us through camping grounds and endless holiday bungalow settlements, most of them empty. If you ever come here, don‚Äôt come between June and September because the infrastructure here is built of a gazillion tourists. May is great, I‚Äôd say. But we‚Äôve been very lucky with the weather.</p>

## How to make a Link Aggregator in Obsidian

date: 2025-05-12, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I‚Äôm finishing up my move from Notion to Obsidian and one complexity I encountered was all my saved links. In the almost seven years of using Notion, I amassed a ~1.2 GB database of links. This is because of how the Notion Web Clipper creates a backup of the article and its assets. While this is gold to an internet archivist‚Ä¶ I really only use this feature to sneak around paywalls. Moving to Obsidian gave me a chance to rethink my link collection process and along the way I figured out how to make an automated Link Aggregator that I could parlay into a newsletter-like blog post.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Install Obsidian Web Clipper</h2>
<p>The first step was to capture links. I had looked at <a href="https://medium.com/@_jonas/quick-bookmarks-clippings-in-obsidian-3050d375697a">creating a custom bookmarklet</a>, but as I rolled this out across my iPad, iPhone, personal computer, and work computer, the foundation wasn‚Äôt sturdy. If I made a change in how I wanted it to work, I‚Äôd have to manually edit half-a-dozen JavaScript bookmarklets. The path of least resistance was to embrace Obsidian Web Clipper, the community standard browser extension for this sort of task instead that is available in all browsers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-web-clipper-add-item-popup.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Add Item Popup window with fields like title, tags, description, and published date" /></p>
<p>Obsidian Web Clipper actually solves a long-standing issue I had with Notion Web Clipper, I couldn‚Äôt add tags in the ‚ÄúAdd Item‚Äù workflow, you had to bounce out to the app and manage it there. Obsidian Web Clipper let‚Äôs you add tags right there in the ‚ÄúAdd Item‚Äù window. But it‚Äôs not all roses because Obsidian will <em>always</em> bounce you out to the application for saving. Weirdly ‚Äìbecause it‚Äôs the same as what I didn‚Äôt like about Notion‚Äì I don‚Äôt mind this in Obsidian because it gives me a chance to review the content I‚Äôm digitally hoarding.</p>
<p>Obsidian Web Clipper will also scrape the text, which is handy for retrieval later, but critically it doesn‚Äôt save images and hotlinks to the production assets. This might upset archivists, but as someone who doesn‚Äôt want a 1.2 GB link database again, I welcome it.</p>
<p>I know AI is a controversial topic, but this is one place I would welcome an LLM to summarize articles and provide some bullet points for reference later. Perhaps a short list of other publications that have referenced this article as well? I‚Äôm spit-balling, but I don‚Äôt need scraped text, what I need is something to jog my memory.</p>
<p>If I had more time, I‚Äôd grab some quotes I found interesting and <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/">do like Jim does</a> and add my own thoughts and notes as a response. Are ‚Äúreaction blogs‚Äù a thing? I guess they are.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-web-clipper-settings.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Web Clipper Settings page where you customize the fields you want to see for your link template" /></p>
<p>The one change I make to the Default template is to remove some fields and set my default Note Location folder to ‚ÄúInputs/Links‚Äù. This is unique to how I have my vault organized (more on that later), but links are easy to accumulate and I find having a dedicated bucket for them will save you cognitive load later.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Write a brief summary</h2>
<p>My link aggregation process has one mandatory process step: Write a brief summary. A short tweet-length description of why I found this link interesting or useful. This is akin to the ‚ÄúWHY?‚Äù column in a database that we‚Äôve been discussing on Shop Talk this year. Why was this link cool enough to collect? Why did I find it interesting? What were my thoughts?</p>
<p>Actual human thoughts are becoming a valuable commodity these days.</p>
<p>In Obsidian Web Clipper there‚Äôs a <code>description</code> field that by default grabs the document description meta tag. This is not useful most of the time, but can give you some text to shape if you‚Äôre in a hurry.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Generate a DataView</h2>
<p>The last step is to create a New Note called ‚ÄúLink Aggregator‚Äù to generate a list of links I can copy over to a Markdown file in my blog. To do that I use the <a href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/">Dataview</a> plugin, which allows you to use an SQL-like query language to generate a <code>LIST</code> or <code>TABLE</code> of content based on your query.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```dataview
LIST WITHOUT ID elink(file.frontmatter.source, file.name)+
                ": "+file.frontmatter.description
FROM "Inputs/Links"
WHERE file.ctime &gt;= date(today) - dur(1 week)
SORT file.name ASC
```
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>There‚Äôs a lot to Dataview, but this query will generate a list of external links from my Links folder that I added within the last week. Now I can slurp up those links and put them in a blog post or newsletter.</p>
<p>Process-wise, I have to copy the Dataview-generated list into a New Note in Obsidian because copying the text from the Link Aggregator page to my blog pastes the Dataview query. Creating a dummy Note isn‚Äôt ideal but at least I have a workaround. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm one plugin away from being able to export markdown from a Dataview query.</p>
<h2>Happy Aggregating!</h2>
<p>Like other ideas in my life, I‚Äôve tried to make this as low-effort as possible or else I won‚Äôt do it. I think I have a system in place that allows me to do what I was already doing (collect links), but a more efficient and effective way to do something I want to do more (share links). If this is useful, feel free to steal this idea and make your own aggregator.</p>
<p>The Web is a network of content, let‚Äôs build the network. Blogs linking to other blogs are the best blogs, let‚Äôs not lose that part of blogging. We are in algorithmic content bubbles looking at different Internets, let‚Äôs pop those bubbles by sharing what we find in our Internet journeys.</p>

I had tried it a few times before and found it hard to get started, but this time I persevered, got to know the characters, and enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)">Six Feet Under</a>, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful. Ever had that experience when you thought a show was great, and then re-watched it and realized it was junk? That happened with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)">Deadwood</a> too. After a while I just couldn't watch it, it was so insipid. What was I even thinking the first time around? Not sure what's next on the agenda. I know I'm watching the Knicks tonight, with a certain <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/17/134201.html?title=theKnicksAndTheEpicFart">dread</a>.

So far Gemini has done the best job of emulating my coding style. Here's an <a href="https://g.co/gemini/share/96dad470052e">example</a>. I didn't have to instruct it in how to do it, it figured it out. Impressive. I've spent a lot of time trying and failing to get Claude and ChatGPT to work the way I work. It makes a big difference, because if I want to try out something they've offered, I have to spend time doing grunt work to get it so I can read it and understand what they're doing.

## What do I really own?

date: 2025-05-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I once owned a few acres of land that had some old trees on it. I sat under one of the trees on a lovely afternoon, and thought of the tree "I own you." The tree formed a thought that somehow I could tune into. "I was here long before you were born and I will be here long after you die." I didn't see it exactly as a response to my claim of ownership. But it sure did put things in perspective!</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/11/ownership.png"></center>I thought of the tree, "I own you."</div></p>
<p>PS: I wrote that paragraph in <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html#p9324">2011</a>. </p>
