## Carl Sagan on Books

date: 2024-11-18, from: Om Malik blog

There seems to be an open season on books. It is such a&#160;shame&#160;that even the so-called educated people don&#8217;t see the bigger picture. Books, in a way, are a&#160;means&#160;to build on collective human history. Our new-fangled &#8220;AI&#8221; is the sum of all books, though even its purveyors are not able to grok this&#160;reality. If not &#8230;

## Can We “SEO “AI?

date: 2024-11-18, from: Om Malik blog

If you can’t beat them, compromise them. The “them” being AI platforms such as ChatGPT and Claude. Ed Sussman, a former lawyer, and his company Citate.ai are pioneering ways to influence how AI chatbots perceive and present information. Their approach isn’t about hacking AI systems but rather systematically shaping the web content that feeds these &#8230;

## 2024-11-18 Being on small fediverse instances

date: 2024-11-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-18-being-on-small-fediverse-instances">2024-11-18 Being on small fediverse instances</h1>

<p>The fediverse is the network of social media instances that communicate via ActivityPub, mostly Mastodon but others exist as well. My own instance runs GoToSocial. The benefit is that nobody can force you to look at ads or sell your data.</p>

<p>Running such an instance means that you need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a server and the admin skills to run it</li>
<li>space to store all the media files (my media folder currently uses about 19 GiB)</li>
<li>space to store all the messages (my database currently uses about 9 GiB)</li>
</ul>

<p>But if you have a friend who runs one, or you&rsquo;re a member of an association that runs one, and you trust their admins, you can hop on. Some friendly souls even run servers out of their own pockets, for free, relying on donations to keep their servers up and running.</p>

<p>What I want to say: it&rsquo;s possible to be part of the independent web.</p>

<p>There are, unfortunately, also problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>on larger instances, moderator burnout sometimes happens</li>
<li>on growing instances, budgets sometimes grow out of control</li>
<li>many people are harassed out of sight of the public</li>
</ul>

<p>I think some people might prefer the bigger corporate players:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter/X</li>
<li>Bluesky</li>
<li>Threads</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a lot more people on those networks, that&rsquo;s for sure.
Personally, I follow about 700 people with three accounts and I have about the same number of people following me, I think.
This is plenty!
I think it would be an illusion for me to think that in network with millions more people my reach and influence would reach new heights.
On the contrary, the algorithm would probably bury my posts and even the people who do want to see my posts would have to dig for them, past ads, sponsored posts and posts with higher engagement metric.</p>

<p>My guess is that we often imagine our alternatives selectively.
We imagine the grass to be greener and our prospects to be better, elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to get started, I&rsquo;d be happy to help.</p>

<p>Some more notes: The Mastodon Client protocol is wholly separate from the typical ActivityPub server-to-server protocol and not the same as the rarely implemented ActivityPub server-to-client protocol.
It&rsquo;s limited, but good enough for a large number of applications.</p>

<p>The two main uses I have seen:</p>

<ul>
<li>separate user interface implementations, be it new front-ends on the web or apps on phones and desktops</li>
<li>bots</li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to do all that without a corporation forcing you to only use official apps so that they can spy on you or monetize you (forcing you to watch the ads) is a great boon.
In addition to that, some servers have very different web front-ends and some servers (like the one I use, GoToSocial), have no web front-end for reading and posting.
This has reduced the burden on developers considerably.</p>

## Most of 2023’s Top Exploited Vulnerabilities Were Zero-Days

date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Zero-day vulnerabilities are <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-317a">more commonly used</a>, according to the Five Eyes:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<p>In 2023, malicious cyber actors exploited more zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise enterprise networks compared to 2022, allowing them to conduct cyber operations against higher-priority targets. In 2023, the majority of the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities were initially exploited as a zero-day, which is an increase from 2022, when less than half of the top exploited vulnerabilities were exploited as a zero-day.</p>
<p>Malicious cyber actors continue to have the most success exploiting vulnerabilities within two years after public disclosure of the vulnerability. The utility of these vulnerabilities declines over time as more systems are patched or replaced. Malicious cyber actors find less utility from zero-day exploits when international cybersecurity efforts reduce the lifespan of zero-day vulnerabilities...</p></blockquote>

## Bluesky feature request

date: 2024-11-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I posted a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lb46hc76n22p">feature request</a> on Bluesky that has gotten a lot of flow. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bluesky devs.. How about a compromise. Support inbound RSS. Let me enter the URL of an RSS feed in settings. I'll ping a fixed location when the feed updates. Would allow the same flow to go to other systems. This would help a lot. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Discussion</b></p>
<ul>
<li><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Imagine a Bluesky-like network that you could post to through any blogging tool that can create an RSS feed. Imagine the new tools that could be created. All of a sudden a whole world of writing tools opens up.</li>
<li>It should happen faster than the proprietary format that Bluesky defined, because RSS is so well understood in the developer world. Lots of software out there for reading and writing. I have a couple of toolkits of my own, for JavaScript, MIT licensed. In use in deployed software so they work pretty well. (Knock wood.) </li>
<li>Also it would create an incentive for competitors to follow suit, and if they do we suddenly have a strong and simple and broadly understood basis for interop. It's a brilliant competitive move, if they really intend to give users choice, to not lock them in. It challenges their competitors to follow suit. I don't doubt that Mastodon would do it. And Threads might even do it if they're feeling competitive with Bluesky. They've already chosen ActivityPub as a basis for interop, but that's been slow to develop. RSS is so simple and well understood it should take a small fraction of the time to adapt.</li>
<li>Bluesky has already pioneered in providing excellent outbound RSS support. I helped them do it, a while back, before the huge onslaught of users. </li>
<li>The fact that so many users loved the idea is enough to have made it worthwhile to suggest it. But I wouldn't be tremendously surprised if they actually did it. </li>
</ul>

## Feedback on sez.us sign up

date: 2024-11-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Why I haven't created an account on <a href="https://sez.us/">sez.us</a> yet. </p>
<ul>
<li>They ask for my first and last name before I sign up. Ask for that info later, after I've created an account. I gave it a fake name to get to the next screen.</li>
<li>Then they ask for my phone number. That's when I hit the back button. I already get too much spam on my phone, and the filters aren't good there. I am happy to provide an email address as my identifier as I do on all other systems. Later, if I become a regular user, I don't mind providing the phone number as part of 2-factor identity, but not up front.</li>
<li>Also I don't like white on black letters. It's hard for me to read. All the competitive systems use black on white background. Offer it as an option if it's important to you, but please default to black on white.</li>
</ul>

## 2024-11-17 Everything is slow and I don't know why

date: 2024-11-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-17-everything-is-slow-and-i-don-t-know-why">2024-11-17 Everything is slow and I don&rsquo;t know why</h1>

<p>When I try to log into the server using SSH it takes a long time. Why is that?
<code>iotop</code> doesn&rsquo;t show anything suspicious. And yet, since Saturday 18:00, <code>munin</code>
shows that something is up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-1.jpg" alt="System CPU goes up. Everything goes up!" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-2.jpg" alt="Disk IO goes up." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-3.jpg" alt="Throughput per device starts to be weird." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-4.jpg" alt="Utilisation per device goes up to 50%." /></p>

<p>I rebooted the server. &ldquo;Have you tried turning it off and on again?&rdquo; 🤷</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p>And that seems to have worked.
I wonder what I did back then.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-5.jpg" alt="Saturday 18:00 shows users connecting (me). Doing something. Who knows what." /></p>

<p>I was clearly doing something!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I noticed: I uploaded a new version of the Norn bot, which had an error. I replaced it.
Was systemd spawning it again and again, spamming the journal? Is that what caused the problem?</p>

<p>This is very strange.</p>

<p>But… rebooting helped!</p>

<p><strong>2024-11-18</strong>. Or did it? The initial connect to the web server still seems to take a second or five. Once the initial handshake is done, the site serves quickly. So what could it be? The problem seen above really is gone.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-6.jpg" alt="CPU is back to normal, lots of idle time." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-7.jpg" alt="Disk utilization is back to normal, nearly 0." /></p>

<p><strong>2024-11-18</strong>. Around midnight, I was exchanging emails with <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a> and everything seemed slow again. Nearly eight hours later, the problem seems to be gone. And the graph supports that.
The question is: What does this mean? If I&rsquo;m assuming that I installed a faulty bot on Saturday 18:00 and fixed it Sunday 18:00 (plus a reboot), what happened from midnight to 2:00?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-8.jpg" alt="Another spike from 0:00 to 2:00." /></p>

<p>Strangely enough, this spike in CPU usage was not accompanied in a spike in disk usage.</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed this morning: Not only is my SSH extremely sluggish – sometimes the command line takes half a minute or longer to update – but my IPv4 banlist also wasn&rsquo;t around. I had to run <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> again to reconstruct it. I&rsquo;ve been banning some more networks, too (mostly Contabo and Hetzner in Germany). It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be helping right now.</p>

<p>And while I&rsquo;m snooping around: This hourly beat in Apache requests seems like a clear sign of bot activity, too. Fuckers.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-9.jpg" alt="Every hour there is a dip. it looks like an inverse heartbeat." /></p>

I see it that way too. When <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/bob-woodward-on-ukraine-the-middle-east--the-election/">Brian Lehrer asked</a> a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election) they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn't have to invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn't think his plan would succeed so spectacularly. BTW, I don't think Trippi's network is the answer, but maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my presence with only <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, in and out. Maybe not for everyone, to start, but it would allow us to start building. It's why I have been lobbying for inbound and outbound RSS as a back-end for all these networks. With the rise of Bluesky in the last couple of weeks (things are happening that fast now) we may have a new shot at it because Masto and Threads are certainly feeling it, and when people feel competed-with they are more open to new thinking.
