## An internet for writers

date: 2024-06-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>The next step in online social media will be group blogs that support the APIs needed to integrate with not only the Fediverse, but other non-AP services that have their own APIs. Each one will have a theme, a voice, not all writers in agreement of course, but sharing a similar perspective, context, point of view.</p>

## 2024-06-06 Learning to be a programmer

date: 2024-06-07, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-06-learning-to-be-a-programmer">2024-06-06 Learning to be a programmer</h1>

<p>I was talking with <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a> and <a class="account" href="https://mas.to/@TodePond" title="@TodePond@mas.to">@TodePond</a> about programming.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mas.to/@TodePond" title="@TodePond@mas.to">@TodePond</a> got me thinking about communities around programming when they wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the problem i see is that no one is talking to each other. everyone is trying to build their solutions in isolation - as island communities. in my opinion we shouldnt build anything new, we should try to make compatible the mindsets and tools that we already have. its an extreme viewpoint but i see no one else taking it, so im taking it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can definitely see many people writing their own software and many more people using existing software and never adapting it. I do it, too!</p>

<p>To put a really hurtful spin onto it: we rarely sit next to a newbie using our software. I never do. Never. We should listen to them muttering to themselves for the first four hours. The bugs they attribute to their own incompetence; the confusing usability issues they never report‚Ä¶ and now imagine sitting next to a newbie looking at our code, trying to find their way. No comments. No helpful guides. The code is the best documentation, some people say. I guess they haven&rsquo;t seen my code. All those readability refactors I didn‚Äôt do. All these questions nobody ever asked me. People look at the code and don‚Äôt come back.</p>

<p>Those are my free software nightmares when I look at all the things I‚Äôve written with a community of one. üò≥</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess what I want to say: if you feel like you write free software for others but nobody joins your community, you are not alone. We are all together in this, alone. üò•</p>

<p>I think the reason for this has to do with how hard it is to understand code by just reading it instead of writing. It‚Äôs super hard to get into another code base. And it is hard to write code such that it is a welcoming ramp up. I‚Äôd say Emacs is one of the examples where it worked but we don‚Äôt actually know whether the approach is ‚Äúgood‚Äù. I certainly used Emacs for a year or two before writing my own init file way back when.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which parts enable it and I&rsquo;m not sure if having more of the same would result in more programmers modifying the code and sharing their modifications.</p>

<ul>
<li>Good documentation of the programming language, Emacs Lisp</li>
<li>Good documentation of the software itself, Emacs</li>
<li>Good documentation of the code, with documentation strings and comments throughout the code base</li>
</ul>

<p>Nearly every function is documented, nearly every global variable is documented, the concepts are documented in the manual, the language is documented in the manual ‚Äì it&rsquo;s a gigantic group effort to build that ramp.</p>

<p>I think this is how you get started modifying Emacs: with an init file that customizes some part of it.</p>

<p>That reminds me of the post by Peter Seibel (2014) that I recently saw linked in my feed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was sometime after that presentation that I finally realized the obvious: code is not literature. We don‚Äôt read code, we decode it. We examine it. A piece of code is not literature; it is a specimen. Knuth said something that should have pointed me down this track when I asked him about his own code reading: ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs not describing reading literature; he‚Äôs describing a scientific investigation.&rdquo; ‚Äì <a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/">Code is not literature</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel this is how I approach new code: find a tiny task and see whether I can make that change. Usually this requires building the code, searching the best location, learning about the code style, investigating the libraries used, and so on. There are many strings attached.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how else to do it.</p>

<p>The same is true at the office. Our code base is about four million lines of code. Newbies get assigned small issues to fix and need to ask a gazillion questions and that&rsquo;s how they learn.</p>

<p>If only there were a better way. If there is, I don&rsquo;t know it.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a> linked a guest post on their blog (2018):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We all read code already; it‚Äôs just that we usually read when we want to edit. And the <em>comprehension</em> that questions about reading are really concerned with‚Äîit comes from both reading and writing, interleaved in complex ways. That hacking produces better comprehension than passive, linear reading fits with what we know about learning. ‚Äì <a href="https://akkartik.name/post/comprehension">Nobody&rsquo;s just reading your code</a>, by <a href="https://stephenmalina.com/">Stephen Malina</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a> summary of our little interchange gives me pause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We live in a world where everybody is illiterate, unable to read computer programs. Everybody. A tiny minority can <em>write</em> programs, but even they can&rsquo;t read programs written by others without 1000x effort. They/we oppress the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, how not to be part of this, I wonder.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-06-07</strong>. <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think ‚Äúprogramming for the household‚Äù is actually awesome. Automating our <em>own</em> lives, autonomously, not squeezing our lives into someone else‚Äôs automation. ‚Äì <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/code-for-yourself">There‚Äôs no shame in programming for yourself</a></p>

## The Great MEV Heist

The Department of Justice indicted two brothers for exploiting mechanisms supporting Ethereum's "Maximal Extractable Value" (MEV). Ashley Berlanger's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/sophisticated-25m-ethereum-heist-took-about-12-seconds-doj-says/"><i>MIT students stole $25M in seconds by exploiting ETH blockchain bug, DOJ says</i></a> explains:<br />
<blockquote>
  Anton, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, were arrested Tuesday, charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each brother faces "a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count," the DOJ said.<br />
<br />
The alleged scheme was launched in December 2022 by the brothers, who studied at MIT, after months of planning, the indictment said. The pair seemingly relied on their "specialized skills" and expertise in crypto trading to fraudulently gain access to "pending private transactions" on the blockchain, then "used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims‚Äô cryptocurrency," the DOJ said
</blockquote>
Below the fold I look into the details of the exploit as alleged in the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">indictment</a>, and what it suggests about the evolution of Ethereum.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<h3>Background</h3>
Lets start with some history. The key issue with MEV is that the architecture of decentralized cryptocurrencies enables a form of <i>front-running</i>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running">Wikipedia defines thus</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Front running, also known as tailgating, is the prohibited practice of entering into an equity (stock) trade, option, futures contract, derivative, or security-based swap to capitalize on advance, nonpublic knowledge of a large ("block") pending transaction that will influence the price of the underlying security. ... A front running firm either buys for its own account before filling customer buy orders that drive up the price, or sells for its own account before filling customer sell orders that drive down the price. Front running is prohibited since the front-runner profits from nonpublic information, at the expense of its own customers, the block trade, or the public market.
</blockquote>
Note that the reason it is illegal in these markets is that, at the time the front-runner enters their order, the customer's order is known only to them. It is thus "material non-public information". Arguably, high-frequency traders front-run by placing their computers so close to the market's computers that the information about orders on which they trade has not in practice had time to "become public".<br />
<br />
I wrote about front-running in cryptocurrencies, describing how it was different, in 2020's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/11/the-order-flow.html"><i>The Order Flow</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In order to be truly decentralized, each miner must choose for itself which transactions to include in the next block. So there has to be a pool of pending transactions visible to all miners, and thus to the public. It is called the mempool. How do miners choose transactions to include? Each transaction in the pool contains a fee, payable to the miner who includes it. Miners are coin-operated, they choose the transactions with the highest fees. <i>The mempool concept is essential to the goal of a decentralized, trustless cryptocurrency</i>.
</blockquote>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnXDbONEeWJepERtoTcvN_v0-yETDJaBeoZQPZLv-AKQnLnYBUawoXvJyN177REga_BypfMW4F3zaivEV-48VXpIfLxX5L64024M1f-trO0qPzVXFMe9kBx6EFcSQwBR_qSsSCTno7bNLW5vNUffZq6LG4l0lGpeB4t2tR0YsUuQxntcuMmHTwtC_FEea6/s930/EthPendingTransactions.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="930" height="86" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnXDbONEeWJepERtoTcvN_v0-yETDJaBeoZQPZLv-AKQnLnYBUawoXvJyN177REga_BypfMW4F3zaivEV-48VXpIfLxX5L64024M1f-trO0qPzVXFMe9kBx6EFcSQwBR_qSsSCTno7bNLW5vNUffZq6LG4l0lGpeB4t2tR0YsUuQxntcuMmHTwtC_FEea6/w200-h86/EthPendingTransactions.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://etherscan.io/dashboards/daily-pending-tx">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
The pool of pending transactions is public, thus front-running is arguably legal and anyone can do it by offering a larger fee. Ethereum's block time is 12 seconds, plenty of time for bots to find suitable transactions in the mempool. It normally contains a <i>lot</i> of pending transactions.  Ethereum is currently processing about <a href="https://etherscan.io/txs">1.12M transactions/day</a> (46.7K/hr) and there are around <a href="https://etherscan.io/dashboards/daily-pending-tx">166K pending transactions</a>, or about 3.6 hours worth. Bitcoin is processing about <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/n-transactions">700K transactions/day</a> and there are normally around <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/mempool-count">100K transactions</a> in the mempool, or 3.5 hours worth.<br />
<br />
Arguably, this is analogous to high-frequency trading, not front-running by brokers. In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/11/the-order-flow.html"><i>The Order Flow</i></a> I recount how the prevalence of high-frequency trading led institutions to set up <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest">dark pools</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
When conventional ‚Äúlit‚Äù markets became overrun with HFT bots, investment banks offered large investors ‚Äúdark pools‚Äù where they could trade with each other without the risk of being front-run by algos. But Barclays allowed HFT bots into its dark pool, where they happily front-run unsuspecting investors who thought they were safe. Eventually Barclays was caught and forced to drain its dark pool. In 2016, it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/31/barclays-and-credit-suisse-to-pay-biggest-ever-fines-for-dark-pool-trading">fined $70 million</a> for fraud. It was not the only large bank that accepted money from large investors to protect them from HFT bots and money from HFT traders to allow them access to the investors it was supposed to be protecting.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/11/the-order-flow.html"><i>The Order Flow</i></a> was in large part sparked by two accounts of attempts to avoid being front-run:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest"><i>Ethereum is a Dark Forest</i></a> by Dan Robinson and Georgios Konstantopoulos:<br />
<blockquote>
In the Ethereum mempool, these apex predators take the form of ‚Äúarbitrage bots.‚Äù Arbitrage bots monitor pending transactions and attempt to exploit profitable opportunities created by them. No white hat knows more about these bots than Phil Daian, the smart contract researcher who, along with his colleagues, wrote the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf">Flash Boys 2.0</a> paper and coined the term ‚Äúminer extractable value‚Äù (MEV).<br />
<br />
Phil once told me about a cosmic horror that he called a ‚Äúgeneralized frontrunner.‚Äù Arbitrage bots typically look for specific types of transactions in the mempool (such a DEX trade or an oracle update) and try to frontrun them according to a predetermined algorithm. Generalized frontrunners look for any transaction that they could profitably frontrun by copying it and replacing addresses with their own. 
</blockquote>
Their attempt to rescue about $12K failed because they didn't know a miner and thus couldn't avoid the dark forest in the mempool, where a front-runner bot found it.
</li>
<li>
And <a href="https://samczsun.com/escaping-the-dark-forest/"><i>Escaping the Dark Forest</i></a>, Samczsun's account of how:
<blockquote>
On September 15, 2020, a small group of people worked through the night to rescue over 9.6MM USD from a vulnerable smart contract.
</blockquote>
The key point of Samczsun's story is that, after the group spotted the vulnerability and built a transaction to rescue the funds, they could not put the rescue transaction in the mempool because it would have been front-run by a bot. They had to find a miner who would put the transaction in a block without it appearing in the mempool. In other words, their transaction needed a dark pool. And they had to trust the cooperative miner not to front-run it.<br />
<br />
Ths attempt succeeded because they did know a miner.</li>

Reading both is essential to understand how adversarial the Ethereum environment is.<br />
<br />
The 2019 paper that published the MEV concept was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf"><i>Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges</i></a> by Philip Daian <i>et 7 al</i>:<br />
<blockquote>
In this work, we explain that DEX [decentralized exchanges] design flaws threaten underlying blockchain security. We study a community of <i>arbitrage bots</i> that has arisen to exploit DEX flaws. We show that these bots exhibit many similar market-exploiting behaviors‚Äî frontrunning, aggressive latency optimization, etc.‚Äîcommon on Wall Street, as revealed in the popular Michael Lewis expose¬¥ Flash Boys. We explore the DEX design flaws that spawned arbitrage bots, measure and model these bots‚Äô behavior, and illuminate systemic smart-contract ecosystem risks implied by our observations. 
</blockquote>
Daian and co-authors describe five pathologies: Pure revenue opportunities, Priority gas auctions (PGAs), Miner-extractable value (MEV), Fee-based forking attacks, and Time-bandit attacks. Their results <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf">find two surprises</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
First, they identify a concrete difference between the consensus-layer security model required for blockchain protocols securing simple payments and those securing smart contracts. In a payment system such as Bitcoin, all independent transactions in a block can be seen as executing atomically, making ordering generally unprofitable to manipulate. Our work shows that analyses of Bitcoin miner economics fail to extend to smart contract systems like Ethereum, and may even require modification once second-layer smart contract systems that depend on Bitcoin miners go live.<br />
<br />
Second, our analysis of PGA games underscores that protocol details (such as miner selection criteria, P2P network composition, and more) can directly impact application-layer security and the fairness properties that smart contracts offer users. Smart contract security is often studied purely at the application layer, abstracting away low-level details like miner selection and P2P relayers‚Äô behavior in order to make analysis tractable ... Our work shows that serious blind spots result. Low-level protocol behaviors pose fundamental challenges to developing robust smart contracts that protect users against exploitation by profit-maximizing miners and P2P relayers that may game contracts to subsidize attacks
</blockquote>
Because it promised profits, MEV became the topic of a lot of research. By 2022, in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/09/miners-extractable-value.html"><i>Miners' Extractable Value</i></a> I was able to review 10 papers about it.<br />
<br />
Then came Ethereum's transition to <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/10/the-power-of-ethereums-merge.html">Proof-of-Stake</a>. As usual, Matt Levine provides a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-16/crypto-brothers-front-ran-the-front-runners">lucid explanation of the basics</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
How does the blockchain decide which transactions to record, and in what order? In Ethereum, the answer is: with money. People who want to do transactions on the Ethereum network <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/">pay fees to execute the transactions</a>; there is a flat base fee, but people can also bid more ‚Äî a ‚Äúpriority fee‚Äù or ‚Äútip‚Äù ‚Äî to get their transactions executed quickly. Every 12 seconds, some computer on the Ethereum network is selected to record the transactions in a block. This computer used to be called a ‚Äúminer,‚Äù but in current proof-of-stake Ethereum blocks are recorded by computers called ‚Äúvalidators.‚Äù Each block is compiled by one validator, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/block-proposal/">selected</a> more or less at random, called a ‚Äúproposer‚Äù; the other validators vote to accept the block. The validators <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/">share the transaction fees</a>, with the block proposer getting more than the other validators.<br />
<br />
The block proposer will naturally prioritize the transactions that pay more fees, because then it will get more money. And, again, the validators are all computers; they will be <i>programmed</i> to select the transactions that pay them the most money. And in fact there is a <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725">division of labor</a> in modern Ethereum, where a computer called a ‚Äú<a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/block-builders">block builder</a>‚Äù puts together a list of transactions that will pay the most money to the validators, and then the block proposer proposes a block with that list so it can get paid.
</blockquote>
Levine then gets into <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-16/crypto-brothers-front-ran-the-front-runners">the details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
I am giving a simplistic and somewhat old-fashioned description of MEV, and modern Ethereum has a whole, like, institutional structure around it. There are <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/01/31/inside-the-private-mempools-where-ethereum-traders-hide-from-front-running-bots/">private mempools</a>, where you can hide transactions from bots. There is <a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, ‚Äúa research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities posed by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) to stateful blockchains, starting with Ethereum,‚Äù which has things like <a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/introduction">MEV-Boost</a>, which creates ‚Äúa competitive block-building market‚Äù where validators can ‚Äúmaximize their staking reward by selling their blockspace to an open market,‚Äù and <a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-share/introduction">MEV-Share</a>, ‚Äúan open-source protocol for users, wallets, and applications to internalize the MEV that their transactions create,‚Äù letting them ‚Äúselectively share data about their transactions with searchers who bid to include the transactions in bundles‚Äù and get paid.
</blockquote>
<h3>What Is Alleged?</h3>
We have two explanations of what the brothers are alleged to have done, one from the DoJ's indictment and one from Flashbots, whose MEV-Boost software was exploited.<br />
<h4>Dept. of Justice</h4>
The DoJ's <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">indictment explains MEV-Boost</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol start="11">
<li>‚ÄúMEV-Boost‚Äù is an open-source software designed to optimize the block-building process for Ethereum validators by establishing protocols for how transactions are organized into blocks.  Approximately 90% of Ethereum validators use MEV-Boost.</li>
<li>Using MEV-Boost, Ethereum validators outsource the block-building process to a network of ‚Äúsearchers,‚Äù ‚Äúbuilders,‚Äù and ‚Äúrelays.‚Äù These participants operate pursuant to privacy and commitment protocols designed to ensure that each network participant‚Äîthe searcher, the builder, and the validator‚Äîinteracts in an ordered manner that maximizes value and network efficiency.</li>
<li>A searcher is effectively a trader who scans the public mempool for profitable arbitrage opportunities using automated bots (‚ÄúMEV Bots‚Äù).  After identifying a profitable opportunity (that would, for example, increase the price of a given cryptocurrency), the searcher sends the builder a proposed ‚Äúbundle‚Äù of transactions.  following transactions in a precise order: The bundle typically consists of the (a) the searcher‚Äôs ‚Äúfrontrun‚Äù transaction, in which the searcher purchases some amount of cryptocurrency whose value the searcher expects to increase; (b) the pending transaction in the mempool that the MEV Bot identified would increase the price of that cryptocurrency; and (c) the searcher‚Äôs sell transaction, in which the searcher sells the cryptocurrency at a higher price than what the searcher initially paid in order to extract a trading profit. A builder receives bundles from various searchers and compiles them into a proposed block that maximizes MEV for the validator. The builder then sends the proposed block to a ‚Äúrelay.‚Äù A relay receives the proposed block from the builder and initially only submits the ‚Äúblockheader‚Äù to the validator, which contains information about, among other things, the payment the validator will receive for validating the proposed block <i>as structured by the builder</i>.  It is only <i>after</i> the validator makes this commitment through a digital signature that the relay releases the full content of the proposed block (<i>i.e.</i> ‚Äî the complete ordered transaction list) to the validator.</li>
<li>In this process, a relay acts in a manner similar to an escrow account, which temporarily maintains the otherwise private transaction data of the proposed block until the validator commits to publishing the block to the blockchain exactly as ordered. The relay will not release the transactions within the proposed block to the validator until the validator has confirmed through a digital signature that it will publish the proposed block as structured by the builder to the blockchain. Until the transactions within the proposed block are released to the validator, they remain private and are not publicly visible.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
Note the importance of the relay maintaining the privacy of the transactions in the proposed block.<br />
<br />
The indictment summarizes how the brothers are alleged to have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">stolen $25M</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol start="17">
<li>ANTON PERAIRE-BUENO and JAMES PERAIRE-BUENO took the following steps, among others, to plan and execute the Exploit: (a) establishing a series of Ethereum validators in a manner that concealed their identities through the use of shell companies, intermediary cryptocurrency addresses, foreign exchanges, and a privacy layer network; (b) deploying a series of test transactions or ‚Äúbait transactions‚Äù designed to identify particular variables most likely to attract MEV Bots that would become the victims of the Exploit (collectively the ‚ÄúVictim Traders‚Äù); (c) identifying and exploiting a vulnerability in the MEV-Boost relay code that caused the relay to prematurely release the full content of a proposed block; (d) re-ordering the proposed block to the defendants‚Äô advantage; and (e) publishing the re-ordered block to the Ethereum blockchain, which resulted in the theft of approximately $25 million in cryptocurrency from the Victim Traders.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
The indictment <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">adds</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol start="15">
<li>Tampering with these established MEV-Boost protocols, which are relied upon by the vast majority of Ethereum users, threatens the stability and integrity of the Ethereum blockchain for all network participants.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
This statement has attracted attention. Why should the DoJ care about "the stability and integrity of the Ethereum blockchain"? Note that the brothers are not charged with this, the indictment has three counts:<br />
<ol>
<li>Wire fraud, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1349.</li>
<li>Wire fraud, Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1343 and 2.</li>
<li>Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).</li>
</ol>
The steps in 11-14 are charged as wire fraud. The indictment then goes on to detail the steps they are alleged to have taken to launder the loot, leading to the money laundering charge.<br />
<h4>Flashbots</h4>
Flashbots' explanation starts by explaining the <a href="https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540"><i>role of a relay</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
mev-boost works through a commit and reveal scheme where proposers commit to blocks created by builders without seeing their contents, by signing block headers. Only after a block header is signed are the block body and corresponding transactions revealed. A trusted third party called a relay facilitates this process. <b>mev-boost is designed to allow block builders to send blocks that contain valuable MEV to validators without having to trust them. Removing the need for builders to trust validators ensures that every validator has equal access to MEV regardless of their size and is critical for ensuring the validator set of Ethereum remains decentralized</b>.
</blockquote>
Notice the traditional <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/01/blockchain-gaslighting.html">cryptocurrency gaslighting</a> about "trustlessness" and "decentralization" in that paragraph:<br />
<ul>
<li>
It is true that by introducing a relay they have eliminated the need to trust the validators, but they have done so by introducing "a trusted third party called a relay". The exploit worked because the third party violated its trust. They would likely argue that, unlike the validators, the relay lacks financial incentives to cheat. But a malign relay could presumably also play the role of the malign proposer in the exploit.</li>

Saying "the validator set of Ethereum <i>remains</i> decentralized" implies that it <i>is</i> decentralized. It is certainly good that the switch to Proof-of-Stake has increaed Ethereum's <a href="https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e">Nakamoto coefficient</a> from 2-3 to 5-6, as I pointed out last month in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/sufficiently-decentralized.html"><i>"Sufficiently Decentralized"</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A year ago the top 5 staking pools controlled 58.4%, now they control 44.7% of the stakes. But it is still true that block production is heavily centralized, with one producer claiming 57.9% of the rewards.
</blockquote>
But a Nakamoto coefficient of 6 isn't very decentralized. Further, this misses the point revealed by the brothers' exploit. With about <a href="https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution">55% of execution clients running Geth</a> and around <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">90% of validators trusting MEV-Boost's relaying</a>, just to take two examples, the software stack is extremely vulnerable to bugs and supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
Flashbots then explain the bug the <a href="https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540">brothers exploited</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The attack on April 3rd, 2023 was possible because the exploited relay revealed block bodies to the proposer so long as the proposer correctly signed a block header. However, the relay did not check if the block header that was signed was valid. In the case that the block header was signed but invalid, the relay would attempt to publish the block to the beacon chain, where beacon nodes would reject it. <strong>Crucially, regardless of whether the block was rejected by beacon nodes or not, the relay would still reveal the body to the proposer</strong>.<br />
<br />
Having access to the block body allowed the malicious proposer to extract transactions from the stolen block and use them in their own block where it could exploit those transactions. In particular, the malicious proposer constructed their own block that broke the sandwich bots‚Äô sandwiches up and effectively stole their money.
</blockquote>
Then they explain the <a href="https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540">mitigation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Usually, proposers publishing a modified block would not only <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">equivocate</a> but their new block would have to race the relay block - which has a head start - to acquire attestations for the fork choice rule. However, in this case, the relay was not able to publish a block because the proposer returned an invalid block header. Therefore, the malicious proposer‚Äôs new block was uncontested and they won the race automatically. This has been addressed by requiring the relay to successfully publish a block, thereby not sharing invalid blocks with proposers. The mitigations section covers this and future looking details at more length.
</blockquote>
By "equivocate" they mean proposing more than one block in a time slot. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">Validators responsibilities are</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The validator is expected to maintain sufficient hardware and connectivity to participate in block validation and proposal. In return, the validator is paid in ETH (their staked balance increases). On the other hand, participating as a validator also opens new avenues for users to attack the network for personal gain or sabotage. To prevent this, validators miss out on ETH rewards if they fail to participate when called upon, and their existing stake can be destroyed if they behave dishonestly. Two primary behaviors can be considered dishonest: proposing multiple blocks in a single slot (equivocating) and submitting contradictory attestations.
</blockquote>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
Matt Levine covered this case in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-16/crypto-brothers-front-ran-the-front-runners"><i>Crypto Brothers Front-Ran the Front-Runners</i></a> by focusing on front-running:<br />
<blockquote>
There is a sort of cool purity to this. In stock markets, some people are faster than others, and can make money by trading ahead of a big order, and people get mad about this and think it is unfair and propose solutions. And when money changes hands for speed advantages ‚Äî ‚Äú<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow">payment for order flow</a>,‚Äù ‚Äú<a href="https://www.marketsmedia.com/revisiting-flash-boys/">colocation</a>‚Äù ‚Äî people complain about corruption. In crypto it‚Äôs like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs create an efficient market in trading ahead of big orders.‚Äù I once wrote: ‚ÄúRather than <i>solve</i> this concern about traditional markets, crypto <i>made it explicit</i>.‚Äù That feels almost like a general philosophy of crypto: Take the problems of traditional finance and make them, <i>worse</i>, sure, but more transparent and visible and explicit and subject to unbridled free markets.
</blockquote>
And then casting the brothers' <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-16/crypto-brothers-front-ran-the-front-runners">actions as front-running</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Ethereum and its decentralized exchanges have a market structure that is like ‚Äúbots can look at your transactions and front-run them if that‚Äôs profitable.‚Äù And these guys, allegedly, front-ran the front-runners; they turned the market structure around so that <i>they</i> could get an early look at the front-running bots‚Äô front-running transactions and front-run them instead. By hacking, sure, sure, it‚Äôs bad. But it leaves the Justice Department in the odd position of saying that the integrity of crypto front-running is important and must be defended.
</blockquote>
I think Levine is wrong here. Just as with high-frequency trading, "crypto front-running" is legal because it uses public information. The brothers were not indicted for front-running. What is illegal, and what the DoJ is alleging, is trading on "material non-public informatiion", which they obtained by wire fraud (a fraudulent signature). The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">indictment says</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
this False Signature was designed to, and did, trick the Relay to prematurely release the full content of the proposed block to the defendants, including the private transaction information.
</blockquote>
The DoJ is not defending the "integrity of crypto front-running", it is prosecuting activity that is illegal in all markets.<br />
<br />
The next day Levine made the first of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-20/the-endless-shrimp-investigation">two clarifications</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
First, though I described the exploit as ‚Äúfront-running the front-runners,‚Äù I do want to be clear that it was not <i>just</i> that. This is not a <i>pure</i> case of (1) submitting spoofy orders to bait front-running bots, (2) having them take the bait and (3) finding some trade to make them lose money. (There are <a href="https://github.com/Defi-Cartel/salmonella">prior examples of that</a>, using oddly structured tokens to make the front-runners lose money.) Here, though, the brothers are accused of something closer to hacking, exploiting a weakness in software code to be able to see (and reorder) a series of transactions that was supposed to be kept confidential from them. That <i>is</i> worse; it‚Äôs sort of like the difference between (1) putting in spoof orders on the stock exchange to try to trick a high-frequency trading firm and (2) hacking into the stock exchange‚Äôs computer system to reverse the HFT firm‚Äôs trades. Even if you think that the front-running bots are bad, you might ‚Äî as the Justice Department does ‚Äî object to this approach to punishing them.
</blockquote>
Exactly. Levine's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-20/the-endless-shrimp-investigation">second clarification was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Second, I said that ‚Äúthey exploited a bug in Ethereum‚Äù to do this, but that‚Äôs not quite right. They exploited a bug in Flashbots‚Äô <a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/introduction">MEV-Boost</a>, open-source block-building software <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/media/1351931/dl">that</a> ‚Äúapproximately 90% of Ethereum validators use‚Äù but that is not part of the core Ethereum system itself. (Here is <a href="https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540">Flashbots‚Äô explanation</a>.) They exploited a bug in how blocks are normally built and proposed on Ethereum. From the names ‚ÄúFlashbots‚Äù and ‚ÄúMEV-Boost,‚Äù though, you might get some sense of why the case is controversial. The way that blocks are normally built and proposed on Ethereum involves ‚Äúmaximal extractable value‚Äù (MEV), where arbitrage traders bid to pay validators for priority to make the most profitable trades. These brothers hacked <i>that</i> system, but not everyone likes that system, because it involves predatory traders front-running more naive traders.<br />
<br />
This is also important because, as one reader commented: ‚ÄúA a crucial distinguishing factor here is that James and Anton did not re-order committed transactions; they instead picked an ordering of pending transactions that were favorable to them. Under this lens, the integrity of the blockchain is not compromised; the network explicitly ‚Äòallows‚Äô validators to pick whatever arbitrary ordering of transactions they like; it's just that generally it‚Äôs economically favorable for validators to prioritize transactions which pay them the most first.‚Äù
</blockquote>
Part of Satoshi Nakamoto's genius in designing Bitcoin was that he observed KISS, the important software mantra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">Keep It Simple, Stupid</a>. The Bitcoin blockchain does only one thing, maintain a ledger of transactions. So it the Bitcoin ecosystem has evolved very slowly, and has been remarkably free of vulnerabilities over the last decade and a half. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a Turing-complete environment that does whatever the users want it to. So over the last less than a decade the Ethereum ecosystem has evolved much faster, accreting complexity and thus vulnerabilities.<br />
<br />
Look at Molly White's <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/"><i>Web3 is Going Just Great</i></a>. It is full of exploits of "smart contracts" such as "decentralized exchanges" and "bridges". Try searching for "bitcoin". You only find it in the context of the amuonts raided. It is precisely the fecundity of the Ethereum's programmability that leads to an ecosystem full of buggy code vulnerable to exploits such as the MEV-Boost one.<br />
<br />
Daniel Kuhn's <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum/amp/"><i>What the DOJ‚Äôs First MEV Lawsuit Means for Ethereum</i></a> also discusses the details of the case:<br />
<blockquote>
‚ÄúThey used a flaw in MEV boost to push invalid signatures to preview bundles. That gives an unfair advantage via an exploit,‚Äù former employee of the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots Hudson Jameson told CoinDesk in an interview. Jameson added that the Peraire-Bueno brothers were also running their own validator while extracting MEV, which violates something of a gentleman‚Äôs agreement in MEV circles.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúNo one else in the MEV ecosystem was doing both of those things at once that we know of,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThey did more than just play by both the codified and pinky promise rules of MEV extraction.‚Äù
</blockquote>
The "gentleman's agreement" is important, because what the brothers were doing creates a conflict of interest, the kind that the SEC frowns upon.<br />
<br />
Kuhn quotes <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum/amp/">Consensys General Counsel Bill Hughes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
‚ÄúAll of the defendants' preparation for the attack and their completely ham-fisted attempts to cover their tracks afterwards, including extensive incriminating google searches, just helps the government prove they intended to steal. All that evidence will look very bad to a jury. I suspect they plead guilty at some point,‚Äù
</blockquote>
He also discusses a different <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum/amp/">reaction in the cryptosphere</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
MEV, which itself is controversial, can be a highly lucrative game dominated by automated bots that often comes at blockchain users‚Äô expense, which is partially why so many in the crypto community have rushed to denounce the DOJ‚Äôs complaint.<br />
...<br />
Still, others remain convinced that exploiting MEV bots designed to reorder transactions is fair game. ‚ÄúIt's a little hard to sympathize with MEV bots and block builders getting f*cked over by block proposers, in the exact same way they are f*cking over end users,‚Äù the anonymous researcher said.
</blockquote>
Kuhn quotes <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum/amp/">Hudson Jameson</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Jameson, for his part, said the MEV is something the Ethereum community should work to minimize on Ethereum, but that it‚Äôs a difficult problem to solve. For now, the process is ‚Äúinevitable.‚Äù<br />
<br />
‚ÄúUntil it can be eliminated, let's study it. Let's illuminate it. Let's minimize it. And since it does exist, let's make it as open as possible for anyone to participate with the same rules,‚Äù he said.
</blockquote>
Jameson is wrong in suggesting that MEV could be eliminated. It is a consequence of the goal of decentralizing the system. Even the mechanism in place for "anyone to participate with the same rules" <i>requires a trusted third party</i>.<br />

## Baseball‚Äôs Gambling Hypocrisy

date: 2024-06-06, from: Om Malik blog

If you&#8217;re wondering why this is a topic of interest, let me elaborate ‚Äî whether it involves selling in-game upgrades, pursuing growth at all costs on Facebook, or engaging in sports betting, I believe these practices are fundamentally wrong and not right way to use technology for the greater good. The weaponization of betting in &#8230;

## Run Your Privacy-Respecting AI on Gentoo Linux

Would you like to have ChatGPT summarize YouTube videos for you, but without
OpenAI knowing the lewd content that you're watching, or paying them an arm
and a leg for it? You can, and it's actually fairly straightforward.

## Posting frequency as the heartbeat of a blog

date: 2024-06-06, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Interesting framing. I&#8217;m curious how much posting frequency is like pacing in physical activity. When I ran, it seemed like I had tiers of exertion &#8212; gears rather than a smooth radio dial. Picking it up to the next level and settling into that pace felt easier than trying to incrementally, marginally increase my speed. [&#8230;]

## 55 TOPS Raspberry Pi AI PC - 4 TPUs, 2 NPUs

Jon Stewart from this Monday is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmxzQJt80XI">good to watch</a> as a reminder of what the press could be doing beyond what Jay Rosen recommends (which is on the right track). They could be playing the same role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I'd love to see a requirement that every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple of weeks a year, to keep them aware of the standard that should also apply to news, not just justice. (Update: <a href="https://x.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1798365545106141236">Jay is on it</a>.)

## Online Privacy and Overfishing

date: 2024-06-05, updated: 2024-06-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> recently <u><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/microsoft-says-it-caught-hackers-china-russia-iran-using-its-ai-tools-2024-02-14/">caught state-backed hackers</a></u> using its generative AI tools to help with their attacks. In the security community, the immediate questions weren&#8217;t about how hackers were using the tools (that was utterly predictable), but about how Microsoft figured it out. The natural conclusion was that Microsoft was spying on its AI users, looking for harmful hackers at work.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39442429">pushed back</a> at characterizing Microsoft&#8217;s actions as &#8220;spying.&#8221; Of <em>course</em> cloud service providers monitor what users are doing. And because we expect Microsoft to be doing something like this, it&#8217;s not fair to call it spying...</p>

If the defining axes of Genesis 1‚Äì11 were making/naming and commanding/disobeying, those of the Patriarchal narratives are fertility/barrenness and pastoral/urban.

The Gettysburg Address it wasn&#8217;t. Seventy-seven years ago, on June 5, 1947, Secretary of State George C. Marshall, who had been a five-star general in World War II, gave a commencement speech at Harvard University. Rather than stirring, the speech was bland. Its long sentences were hard to follow. It was vague. And yet, in just under eleven minutes on a sunny afternoon, Marshall laid out a plan that would shape the modern world.

## 2024-06-01 Fonts are important

date: 2024-06-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-01-fonts-are-important">2024-06-01 Fonts are important</h1>

<p>I was thinking about writing a simple editor again. The <a href="https://smallandnearlysilent.com/">Small and Nearly Silent</a> web app by <a class="account" href="https://tenforward.social/@eli_oat" title="@eli_oat@tenforward.social">@eli_oat</a> is beautiful because it mixes text and line drawings. I often feel that I&rsquo;d like a simple path-based SVG-like drawing ability, like <a href="https://akkartik.name/lines.html">lines</a>, by <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a>. Some lines, some control points, some curves, filling stuff with patterns‚Ä¶ I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;d actually use it, but it&rsquo;s alluring.</p>

<p>The whole <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">uxn</a> ecosystem with many different small tools is also quite alluring. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also a bit hard to get into an existing ecosystem like that. I still feel that if spent a while writing something myself, it&rsquo;d feel more like it was &ldquo;mine&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d just understand it better. I just don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m ready to spend that much time on it, or if I&rsquo;d even be able to pull it off. So that&rsquo;s why I wavering at the same time that I&rsquo;m fascinated.</p>

<p>Given all that, I was thinking about Gforth and found <a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Gforth-SDL2-Bindings/">SDL2 Bindings for Gforth</a>, and I found the example <a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Yellow-Snow">Yellow Snow</a> game using this library, I tried to compile it and Gforth complained about the missing headers. No problem, I thought to myself. I know what to do: <code>sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev</code> ‚Äì but the mixer results in <a href="https://doc.sccode.org/">SuperCollider</a> getting deinstalled. Oh no!</p>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m once again thinking about the thing I actually want to do. Do I want to build an Emacs light? A simple line-based text editor like <code>ed</code> but with more features? An editor that only runs inside a terminal, like <code>kilo</code> or <code>mini</code>? See <a href="2018-03-12_Writing_an_Editor">2018-03-12 Writing an Editor</a> for more. Or would it be an editor with a GUI? Would it work only with X11? Or would it be based on SDL?</p>

<p>I feel like an editor with a minimal GUI would be nice. I don&rsquo;t think I need a menu, but I think I&rsquo;d like a way to scale font size up and down, UTF-8 support to write German and Portuguese, basically render Markdown and some simple variant of SVG, inline. I feel like that&rsquo;s why I need to start with graphics and font support. Otherwise I&rsquo;ll end up with something like <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~m15o/grid/">grid</a>: a cool <a href="https://plan9.io/wiki/plan9/using_acme/index.html">ACME</a>-inspired text editor, but it would only really works for English.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Editor">#Editor</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-06-04</strong>. Thinking about Go and the <a href="https://github.com/hibiken/mini">mini</a> editor.
It runs in a terminal. So what would it take to turn it into a graphical editor with fonts, ligatures, bidirectional text, font-sizes, and all of that?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/go-text/typesetting">go-text/typesetting</a> is a library that&rsquo;s used by <a href="https://fyne.io">Fyne</a>, <a href="https://gioui.org">Gio</a>, and <a href="https://ebitengine.org">Ebitengine</a>. So perhaps one of these frameworks?</p>

<p>Fyne has a <a href="https://apps.fyne.io/apps/com.fynelabs.notes.html">Notes</a> example application.
It looks like a nice, simple app. When I built it, however, it didn&rsquo;t work.
Is it because I&rsquo;m on Wayland? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Gio is used by <a href="https://anvil-editor.net/">Anvil</a>, an ACME-like editor with many features.
In fact, it already looks like it has too many features for me to start building something.
I wonder. Perhaps those are the right features? I just can&rsquo;t warm up to using the mouse all that much.</p>

<p>Ebitengine has a <a href="https://ebitengine.org/en/examples/font.html">Font</a> example.
It just shows how one loads a font for a number of code-points and that&rsquo;s that.
An interesting way to load a font, for sure.</p>

## Convicted felon Donald Trump

date: 2024-06-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Keith Olbermann makes a good point in <a href="https://omny.fm/shows/countdown-with-keith-olbermann/keep-calling-him-convicted-felon-donald-trump-6-4">today's podcast</a>. </p>
<p>Instead of "Donald Trump" we should always say "Convicted felon Donald Trump."</p>
<p>It's branding and it works. He's right. </p>

The test for whether it's a podcast or not is if they say you can get it "Wherever you get your podcasts." If they can say that, it's a podcast. If you have to get it from Apple or YouTube or whoever, it's not a podcast. That's the rule.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

In other words the designers of CSS and JavaScript and probably every other technology everyone uses had no idea what actual developers were doing with their committee-designed creation. They made mistakes and piled them on each other, fixing old mistakes with new mistakes. After 30 years of evolving in this convoluted way, if you want to create useful software, you have to either master all of it (and no one has) or pay $20 a month to OpenAI so you can use it to navigate the awful hairball that the web platform has become. Where we only have a sliver of knowledge as humans, <i>the machine knows all of it.</i> And that's just programming. I'm just guessing that everything is that way. You know the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6c5a6426-62f9-48c1-9995-b4ae6f808907">part</a> in The Matrix Reloaded where we're told <a href="https://youtu.be/Ny_mr3QX9Q8?si=7GMMS7dBvZW5cOag&t=165">no one knows</a> how the technology works. That's where we are now. Spend your whole life using the stuff and you still only know a tiny fraction of what you need to make good software. We needed what ChatGPT does, but we didn't know we needed it. That's where we are now, and the journos are sitting on the sidelines hurling <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Spitballs">spitballs</a> at it.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

What got me spinning was listening to Rachel Maddow advertise her podcast at the beginning of her show last night. You can get the podcast for free, she says, or if you want no ads, you can pay some money and get it from Apple. What Apple is selling there, and Maddow is going along with, is not a freaking podcast and by calling it one they undermine a great medium. I understand why Maddow might not care, she makes millions from a medium that doesn't give users much choice (ie MSNBC) so why should she care about podcasting, which does.

If you have to use Apple, Audible, Spotify or Google to listen to something, that's nice, hope it's good for you, but folks that is not a podcast. Podcasts give you the listener all the power. If you give it up it'll all be Disneyfied before too long. It pisses me off that Amazon Music sends me messages about all the new "podcasts" they have. I mutter under my breath when I hear this, some expletive I'd rather not repeat. Amazon, the users know that podcasting == user choice, and they hate you just a little every time you lie about it. Find another term you like and use that. You have the money to do the marketing. Come on, just once play fair. You'll be surprised how good it feels, and I wouldn't be surprised if the users reward you for it.

It guides me through difficult programming situations, esp around convoluted designs like CSS and JavaScript. It knows all of it. The only times it hallucinates (and I know it's doing it btw, I'm not stupid) is when there is not enough info on the web to give an answer. It would be nice if it just said "I don't know" but it's early, and they haven't figured out how to do that yet. The journalists have no sense of wonder I guess, or they never thought to use it in their jobs. I can't wait for the first aha! from a journalist -- who will say this: "Aha! Now I see what this is for and it's freaking lovely." But they've decided it sucks and that's that. Too bad, we're going on without them. And thanks to the good moderation tools we can keep the turd-droppers from totally screwing it up.

## Breaking a Password Manager

date: 2024-06-04, updated: 2024-06-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/roboform-password-3-million-dollar-crypto-wallet/">story</a> of breaking the security of the RoboForm password manager in order to recover a cryptocurrency wallet password.</p>
<blockquote><p>Grand and Bruno spent months reverse engineering the version of the RoboForm program that they thought Michael had used in 2013 and found that the pseudo-random number generator used to generate passwords in that version&#8212;¬≠and subsequent versions until 2015¬≠&#8212;did indeed have a significant flaw that made the random number generator not so random. The RoboForm program unwisely tied the random passwords it generated to the date and time on the user‚Äôs computer¬≠&#8212;it determined the computer‚Äôs date and time, and then generated passwords that were predictable. If you knew the date and time and other parameters, you could compute any password that would have been generated on a certain date and time in the past...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-05-23 Death and dying

date: 2024-06-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">2024-05-23 Death and dying</h1>

<p>This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am old enough to be an adult about it.</p>

<p>One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn&rsquo;t go myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn&rsquo;t there for my sister&rsquo;s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours, back then. I don&rsquo;t know how things are now. There was school and stuff and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn&rsquo;t feel very close. It just felt weird. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was supposed to mean.</p>

<p>Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his heart is failing; they can&rsquo;t give him his heart medication because the kidneys are at their limits, can&rsquo;t have him move around because he&rsquo;s weak, and so he&rsquo;s breaking down. I mean, he&rsquo;s calm, he knows what&rsquo;s happening, and he&rsquo;s very, very tired. He&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>

<p>I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to go one day. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines. I&rsquo;ll be very, very tired. I&rsquo;ll just want to go home. I also won&rsquo;t want anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll feel that I lived a good life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will be able to let go and be at peace. It&rsquo;s what I hear about my stepfather.</p>

<p>But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and Germany and my mother, and one after another people start crying, choking up, it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s that invisible choker, grabbing us, one after another.</p>

<p>I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back to haunt us, now.</p>

<p>To go and support each other.</p>

<p>Go and hug your loved ones.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Family">#Family</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn‚Äôt look good at all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping, mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us, saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes, stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.</p>

<p>There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister, my sister, my half-brother‚Äôs wife, their kid, my mom‚Ä¶ the kid was the only one that seemed unperturbed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be sad, grandma!‚Äù</p>

<p>Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of them super nice. We‚Äôll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it‚Äôs not my partner that has died.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I‚Äôm happy we were all there for each other.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on the radio.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-30</strong>. On the way home. It was good to see the family again. I gave a little speech in Portuguese, explaining how the language continues to remain important to us, even if we live a abroad, and how hard it was for a family where people live in different countries, alone ‚Äì but also how our parents divorcing and marrying had led to an ever growing family. There are more parents, more siblings, and I love it and it helps. We can all help each other. And my deceased stepfather was certainly an enrichment for our family, bringing anarchy and lawlessness and laughter into a family that was rigid and regimented and dour, and how we all grew with that and how it was important to remember the good times we had and the lessons we all drew from his presence. Truly, a great influence for all of us.</p>

<p>I still remember how I met him years before my mother met him. He lived across the river alone with his son, wild and free and I was so jealous. I wished to live like that! And then my parents divorced, my dad went back to Switzerland and a year later I followed him and got to live wild and free like them, it was amazing. And one day I came back and there were rumours that our mother had found a boyfriend. Imagine my surprise when it was him, the wild and free guitar playing dude from across the river! And eventually my friend from school turned into my stepbrother, moved in with my mom, lived in my room. It was mysterious and magical and then to see him and his father struggle with my mom, the changes they brought about, it was a miracle.</p>

<p>So, my man, wherever you are, here&rsquo;s to you and your last trip, to your guitars and flutes, your love of music and freedom, your spirit of independence and love of people and aliens. Cheers! I hope to see you again.</p>

## June 3, 2024 

date: 2024-06-04, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

The fallout from the New York jury&#8217;s conviction of Donald Trump on 34 felony counts last Thursday, May 30, continues. Trump&#8217;s team continues to insist that the guilty verdict will help him, but that&#8217;s nonsensical on its face: if guilty verdicts are so helpful, why has he moved heaven and earth to keep the many other cases against him from going to trial? And why are he and House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) calling for the Supreme Court to overturn the convictions?

## Testing Raspberry Pi's AI Kit - 13 TOPS for $70

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Testing Raspberry Pi's AI Kit - 13 TOPS for $70</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Raspberry Pi today launched the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ai-kit-available-now-at-70/">AI Kit</a>, a $70 addon which straps a Hailo-8L on top of a Raspberry Pi 5, using the recently-launched M.2 HAT (the Hailo-8L is of the M.2 M-key variety, and comes preinstalled).</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-ai-kit.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI Kit"></p>

<p>The Hailo-8L's claim to fame is 3-4 TOPS/W efficiency, which, along with the Pi's 3-4W idle power consumption, puts it alongside Nvidia's edge devices like the Jetson Orin in terms of TOPS/$ and TOPS/W for price and efficiency.</p>

<p>Google's <a href="https://coral.ai">Coral TPU</a> has been a popular choice for a machine learning/AI accelerator for the Pi for years now, but Google seems to have left the project on life support, after the Coral hardware was scalped for a couple years about as badly as the Raspberry Pi itself!</p></div>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If you make a podcast client, I'd like to have an <a href="https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">OPML list</a> of all the feeds I'm subscribed to in my client so I can follow it in my feed reader. I'd really like it to go the other way, actually, so I could maintain the list on my desktop computer, and have it automatically reflected in the mobile podcast client. It's very important that it use OPML, that's the standard for this stuff. I couldn't possibly get excited by another format. Podcasting thrives on these standards. The client I use is <a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a> which is part of Automattic. BTW, you can <a href="https://editsubscriptionlists.opml.org/">use Drummer to edit</a> a subscription list. Its native format is OPML.

Today I was asked how I feel about podcasting now. Here's what I said. It's still working -- people expect to have choice in where they listen to their podcasts, and as long as that's true they will imho continue to have choice. But even if Google took it over tomorrow, I'd be happy with the outcome. It's been over 20 years since we rolled it out, and it's still delivering huge value to lots of people, and isn't controlled by anyone, as far as I can tell there are no gatekeepers. If only we had been able to keep blogging free of that kind of control, but I have hope there too.

## Archiving a Way

date: 2024-06-03, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

My father, Allen H. Searls, was an archivist. Not a formal one, but good in the vernacular, at least when it came to one of the most consequential things he did in his life: helping build the George Washington Bridge. He did this by photographing his work and fellow workers. He shot with a Kodak [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

One of the flaws in the design of Teslas is they are really difficult to operate safely for people who are farsighted, such as myself. A lot of the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/03/teslascreen.png">status messages</a> are too small for me to read without reading glasses, and in the time it takes to put them on the message is gone. Esp frustrating for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And when I'm flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms Tesla. This is a design problem. Maybe you should use voice prompts for this kind of stuff. Or use a camera to see if my hands are on the wheel.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/02/librarian.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I keep coming back to this -- ChatGPT is a vast library that comes with its own librarian. And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what the critics say) in an instant. I've been using libraries my whole life, going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and <i>isn't that what we want?</i> To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn't get more meaningful than this.

Another great application for ChatGPT. Try to find a blog post or article about the design of a language that gets to what you want to know without wading through a lot of stuff you don't care about. I got it to explain Swift, Go and Rust quickly. Okay now I know what they're doing. It would have taken me days to assemble this, and I never have that kind of time for such execursions.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at compile-time or runtime. It should strive to read like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>. We started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the computer, and for a few decades we were factoring and making it simpler with every iteration, but then we turned around in the other direction. I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I plan to write more about this.

## Seeing Like a Data Structure

date: 2024-06-03, updated: 2024-05-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Technology was once simply a tool&#8212;and a small one at that&#8212;used to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1940761.1940772">amplify human intent and capacity</a>. That was the story of the industrial revolution: we could control nature and build large, complex human societies, and the more we employed and mastered technology, the better things got. We don&#8217;t live in that world anymore. Not only has technology become entangled with the structure of society, but we also can no longer see the world around us without it. The separation is gone, and the control we thought we once had has revealed itself as a mirage. We&#8217;re in a transitional period of history right now...</p>

## AI Will Increase the Quantity‚Äîand Quality‚Äîof Phishing Scams

date: 2024-06-03, updated: 2024-06-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A piece I coauthored with Fredrik Heiding and Arun Vishwanath in the <cite>Harvard Business Review</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Summary. </strong>Gen AI tools are rapidly making these emails more advanced, harder to spot, and significantly more dangerous. Recent research showed that 60% of participants fell victim to artificial intelligence (AI)-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success rates of non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts. Companies need to: 1) understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing, 2) determine the company or division‚Äôs phishing threat severity level, and 3) confirm their current phishing awareness routines...</p></blockquote>

<h1 id="2024-06-02-slow-worm">2024-06-02 Slow worm</h1>

<p>The sandals you see in the picture above are my running sandals.
See <a href="2015-08-27_Luna_Sandals_Review_by_Benjamin_Baugh">a review by Benjamin Baugh</a> from nearly 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I was running through the forest on the hill behind us:</p>

If I wanted my calculator to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if you pay attention and don't drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that you can do things you never could do before.

## Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few days ago, the post <a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-the-awx-project/">Upcoming Changes to the AWX Project</a> came across my feed. An innocuous title, but sometimes community-impacting changes are buried in posts like this. So, as an interested Ansible user, I read through the post.</p>

<p>In 1,610 words, almost nothing of substance was written.</p>

<p>A lot about how it's not 2014 anymore, so 2014-era architecture doesn't suit AWX. Then a big bold disclaimer at the bottom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we conclude, we should be clear about what will not happen.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>We are not changing the Ansible project</li>
  <li>We are not adjusting our OSS license structure</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Ultimately, we need to make some changes to the way our systems work and our projects are structured. Not a rewrite but a refactoring and restructuring of how some of the core components connect and communicate with each other.</p></blockquote></div>

That guaranteed two things -- that the technology would be maximally simple, and that anyone with a computer could do the whole recording and production job without help from an expensive studio. In both cases the result was nowhere near commercial standards, but that didn't matter, in fact it helped that there were so many glitches in my early podcasts, that said that hey if this guy can do it, so can I.

Today, as MAGA Republicans attack the rule of law and promise to prosecute their political enemies if they get back into power, it&#8217;s easy to forget that once upon a time, certain Republican politicians championed reason and compromise and took a stand against MAGAs&#8217; predecessors.
