date: 2024-02-06, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Since the security of the U.S.-Mexico border is a top issue for many Americans, the Republican Party is betting that their strategy will win the day &#8230; or at least the presidential election. But it isn&#8217;t much of a plan. The strategy: Do nothing. The reason: Because Donald Trump said so.

## Lines of code – how to not measure code quality and developer efficiency

date: 2024-02-06, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

Lately I have a person who pings me daily asking how many lines of code I have written today. The first time was on the weekend. My answer was &#8220;none, as weekends I concentrate on not doing computer things with my partner&#8221; which is an excellent idea. However, lines of code are often seen as [&#8230;]

## Funding Dan to improve curl tests

date: 2024-02-06, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

A few weeks ago I mentioned how we fund Stefan&#8217;s work on improving HTTP(/3) in curl. Now, in similar spirit we are funding Dan Fandrich to work on further improving test infrastructure. Dan has worked fiercely on the introduction of parallel tests over the recent year or so and this is work that builds on &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/02/06/funding-dan-to-improve-curl-tests/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Funding Dan to improve curl tests</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## Why I preach to the choir

date: 2024-02-05, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, Several of you have asked me why I spend so much time and energy on this letter, which is read mainly (if not exclusively) by people who already share my views and values. &#8220;Why are you preaching to the choir?&#8221; you ask. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t your efforts be more useful if you tried to convince people who aren&#8217;t already convinced?&#8221;

## How to understand the politics of Israel and Palestine?

date: 2024-02-04, from: Robert Reich's blog

How to teach and how to learn about a tragedy. An open society sees truth as process and method &#8212; more verb than noun.

## A New ’Joy‘ in Jazz

date: 2024-02-04, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Samara Joy has been called the new voice of jazz, a vocal phenom, a savior of the genre. This young lady is &#8220;joy&#8221; personified and today&#8217;s reason to smile, from her stunning jazz singing to her megawatt smile. The 24-year-old jazz sensation from the Bronx surprised a lot of people at last year&#8217;s Grammy Awards when she won not only Best Jazz Vocal Album but also Best New Artist, an award given only three times to a jazz artist. She will be back at the Grammys tonight as a presenter and again as a nominee. Take a listen to her incredible improvisation on the Grammy-nominated song &#8220;Tight.&#8221;
