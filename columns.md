## "Owning" e-books

The basic aspiration of the <a href="https://lockss.org/">LOCKSS Program</a> when we <a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2013/10/it-was-fifteen-years-ago-today.html">started a quarter century ago</a> was to enable libraries to continue their historical mission of collecting, preserving, and providing readers with access to academic journals. In the paper world libraries which subscribed to a journal <i>owned</i> a copy; in the digital world they could only <i>rent</i> access to the publisher's copy. This allowed the oligoply academic publishers to increase their rent extraction from research and education budgets.<br />
<br />
LOCKSS provided a cheap way for libraries to collect, preserve and provide access to their own copy of journals. The competing e-journal preservation systems accepted the idea of rental; they provided an alternate place from which access could be rented if it were denied by the publisher.<br />
<br />
Similarly, libraries that purchased a paper book <i>owned</i> a copy that they could loan to readers. The transition to e-books meant that they were only able to <i>rent</i> access to the publisher's copy, and over time the terms of this rental grew more and more onerous.<br />
<br />
Below the fold I look into a recent effort to mitigate this problem.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Gennie Gebhart's 2019 <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/publishers-should-be-making-e-book-licensing-better-not-worse"><i>Publishers Should be Making E-Book Licensing Better, Not Worse</i></a> reports on another turn of the e-book rental screw:<br />
<blockquote>
When Macmillan releases a new book, library systems will be able to purchase only one digital copy for the first eight weeks after it‚Äôs published. Macmillan is offering this initial copy for half-price ($30), but that has not taken away the sting for librarians who will need to answer to frustrated users. In large library systems in particular, readers are likely to experience even longer hold queues for new Macmillan e-book releases. For example, under the new Macmillan embargo, the 27 branches of the San Francisco Public Library system, serving a city of nearly 900,000 people, will have to share one single copy right when the demand for the new title is the greatest.<br />
...<br />
After the two-month embargo period ends, libraries will be welcome to purchase additional copies of the e-book under normal terms, which aren‚Äôt great to begin with: typically, a $60 price tag for an e-book that can only be lent out to one user at a time for two years or 52 lends, whichever comes first. After that, the library has to license another e-book.
</blockquote>
Gebhart's use of "purchase" here is misleading, they are signing a two-year lease.  Macmillian can make life miserable for libraries and their readers because they are "<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/">too big to care</a>". Gebhart <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/publishers-should-be-making-e-book-licensing-better-not-worse">explains</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In a July <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/binary-data/ARTICLE_ATTACHMENT/file/000/004/4222-1.pdf">memo</a>, CEO John Sargent says the publisher‚Äôs move is motivated by ‚Äúgrowing fears that library lending was cannibalizing sales‚Äù of new e-books and a need to ‚Äúprotect the value of your books during their first format publication,‚Äù but fails to present any evidence to back up his claims. (He also ignores existing, consistent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/06/ebook-lending-wont-put-big-dent-book-sales">evidence</a> <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/66106-the-case-for-libraries.html">to</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelkramerbussel/2019/04/12/how-libraries-boost-book-sales/#25e618334d76">the</a> <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/49316-survey-says-library-users-are-your-best-customers.html">contrary</a>.)
</blockquote>
On 13<sup>the</sup> August, the Independent Publishers Group and the Digital Public Library of America <a href="https://dp.la/news/groundbreaking-ebook-agreement?mc_cid=b690d51703">announced a deal</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  Through this landmark collaboration between IPG and DPLA, libraries around the country will now have the power to purchase and own in perpetuity, rather than merely license, tens of thousands of ebook and audiobook titles from dozens of independent publishers. The agreement will empower libraries to fulfill their mission to provide access to books for readers nationwide. Publishers such as Austin Macauley, Arcadia Publishing, Dynamite Entertainment, Dover Publications and JMS Books, alongside dozens of other renowned indie publishers, are participating in the deal.
</blockquote>
Of course, none of the major publishers would agree to this. The <a href="https://dp.la/news/groundbreaking-ebook-agreement?mc_cid=b690d51703">press release</a> explains:<br />
<blockquote>
  Now, libraries will be able to purchase books through the Palace Marketplace, a non-profit ebook and audiobook platform developed by The Palace Project in consultation with libraries, for libraries. The Palace Project provides libraries with tools and resources that allows patrons to access the broadest possible range of ebooks and audiobooks sourced from the widest variety of sources. Among the tens of thousands of books that are now available for libraries to own and lend out digitally are contemporary award-winning titles, like Leticia Aguilar‚Äôs spellbinding memoir <i>Leaving Patriarchy Behind</i>, Michael Nicholson‚Äôs <i>The Mosaic Escalator</i>, a mind-bending adventure story nominated for the Best Fiction Book Award by the Golden Book Awards 2024, as well as classics like Elizabeth Bowen‚Äôs debut novel <i>The Hotel</i>.<br />
...<br />
  ‚ÄúAfter more than 12 years explaining to policy makers and publishers why existing license models for ebooks prevent libraries from fulfilling their mandates, this agreement is a win that libraries, publishers and authors should celebrate together,‚Äù said <b>Christina de Castell, Chief Librarian &amp; CEO of the Vancouver Public Library</b>. ‚ÄúNow, libraries will be able to take steps to share and preserve authors‚Äô ebooks as we have always shared and preserved their print books. I hope this agreement is a model that leads other publishers towards more flexible licensing terms, so libraries can continue to be the home for our collective knowledge in our increasingly digital world.‚Äù
</blockquote>
Details of how the technology works are scarce, although the Palace code is on <a href="https://github.com/ThePalaceProject">github</a>. The DPLA's <a href="https://ebooks.dp.la/"><i>Everyone should have access to knowledge</i></a> claims:<br />
<blockquote>
  <a href="http://exchange.dp.la/">Palace Marketplace</a>, formerly DPLA Exchange, is an e-content acquisitions platform that works seamlessly with the <a href="http://thepalaceproject.org/">Palace app</a>. With Palace Marketplace, libraries can customize diverse collections beyond the bestsellers, including non-English titles. Member libraries benefit from DPLA‚Äôs ongoing publisher negotiations for new, more favorable licensing terms, and have access to our collection of more than 11,000 open access ebooks.
</blockquote>
So it appears that "members" have access to books they "purchased" hosted at DPLA. Once again, as with e-journal preservation systems such as Portico, this is a welcome development but it isn't a solution to the underlying problem. It is in fact another instance of the same problem, because the member libraries are renting access to DPLA's copy. As I understand it, these libraries would be able to download a copy, and preserve it themselves outside the Palace ecosystem, but it isn't clear whether the terms of use would allow them to provide their readers access to the preserved copy.<br />
<br />
The key barrier to implementing true "purchase" rather than "rental" is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine">First-sale Doctrine</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The first-sale doctrine (also sometimes referred to as the "right of first sale" or the "first sale rule") is an American legal concept that limits the rights of an intellectual property owner to control resale of products embodying its intellectual property. The doctrine enables the distribution chain of copyrighted products, library lending, giving, video rentals and secondary markets for copyrighted works (for example, enabling individuals to sell their legally purchased books or CDs to others).
</blockquote>
But it doesn't apply to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine#Application_to_digital_copies">digital copies</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The first-sale doctrine does not neatly fit transfers of copies of digital works because an actual transfer does not actually happen‚Äîinstead, the recipient receives a new copy of the work while, at the same time, the sender has the original copy (unless that copy is deleted, either automatically or manually). ...<br />
<br />
E-books have the same issue. Because the first sale doctrine does not apply to electronic books, libraries cannot freely lend e-books indefinitely after purchase. Instead, electronic book publishers came up with business models to sell the subscriptions to the license of the text. 
</blockquote>
Mary Minow's 2017 <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/2017/02/19/future-libraries-need-first-sale-ebooks/"><i>Future of Libraries ‚Äì Need First Sale for ebooks</i></a> explains the importance of first sale for libraries:<br />
<blockquote>
It is essential to libraries, and the term existential would not be too great a term to use, to be able to own digital files, and care for them via preservation and library lends (e.g. to one person at a time) just as they do with print.  Can readers count on books being available a year or two or five after publication? The existence of libraries has made this possible from their inception until now.
</blockquote>
The <a href="https://dp.la/news/groundbreaking-ebook-agreement?mc_cid=b690d51703">DPLA echoes this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
‚ÄúCopyright‚Äôs ‚Äòfirst sale doctrine‚Äô is important to readers and libraries for a number of reasons, not least of which is the way that it facilitates long-term preservation and access,‚Äù noted <b>Lyrasis CEO John Wilkin</b>. ‚ÄúLicensing models have threatened this critical underpinning, which is needed for preservation of the cultural record. Lyrasis is excited to collaborate with DPLA and IPG in the creation of a model that will make preservation and access of digital content possible.‚Äù
</blockquote>
Alas, even if the first-sale barrier were removed, the experience of the LOCKSS program shows that the problem would remain. In the paper world building a local collection was essential for libraries to provide service to their <i>current</i> readers. The costs and effort involved in doing so were inescapable. The fact that doing so safeguarded access for <i>future</i> readers was a no-cost, no-effort side-effect. But in the digital world building a local collection is irrelevant to providing service to <i>current</i> readers. They get access from the publisher. The costs and effort devoted to building a local collection are only in the interest of <i>future</i> readers. Thus, given strained budgets, these costs must be minimized. The choice between maintaining a local collection, and simply outsourcing the task of supporting future readers to a service by signing a small check is a no-brainer.<br />
<br />
Worse, three other considerations weigh in the balance:<br />
<ul>
<li>The publishers are highly motivated to ensure that current readers access their copy, because this provides them data they can sell to advertisers.</li>
<li>The publishers view many local collections as a bigger risk of their content leaking than a small number of concentrated archives, which they expect will be better secured.</li>
<li>Economies of scale mean a centralized archive is likely to have a lower cost per unit content than a distributed one.</li>
</ul>
The LOCKSS Program devoted a great deal of engineering effort to reducing the capital and operational cost, and increasing the security of, two generations of an <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/bsdcon03/tech/full_papers/rosenthal/rosenthal_html/index.html">appliance</a> that libraries could use to build a local collection of the e-journals to which they subscribed. But in the end most libraries that cared about protecting access for future readers to this content chose to sign checks to centralized archives. Of course, it didn't help that the publishers of the most expensive content would not allow libraries to use the appliance to collect it.<br />

## The Dev Tools Performance Monitor Panel

date: 2024-09-03, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Weeks ago I was looking in to a performance issue for our animated spinner component and stumbled across a tool in DevTools I hadn‚Äôt used before: <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance-monitor">The Performance Monitor Panel</a>. In you open <code>Dev Tools &gt; More Tools &gt; Performance Monitor</code> you‚Äôll see some helpful high-level charts and graphs of the realtime performance data of your UI.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/perfmonitorpanel.jpg" alt="The Figma.com homepage with the performance panel open to the side showing 120 style recalcs per second" /></p>
<p>The Performance Monitor collects performance data in realtime and puts it on a graph. It‚Äôs handy for detecting performance problems at a high-level. If your CPU, memory, DOM node count, or event listeners only go up while <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/sanding-ui/">clicking around</a>, you probably have a leak in your code. The part I was most interested in were style recalculations per second and layouts per second. Our spinner component was triggering style recalculations and layout calls at a rate of 120 per second. Yikes! That‚Äôs a lot of extra work on the CPU.</p>
<p>Next I turned on <code>Dev Tools &gt; More Tools &gt; Rendering &gt; Show Paint Flashes</code> and I could immediately see the tactile feedback of green boxes thrashing around as the browser repainted the component hundreds of times per second. The green paint boxes confirmed that this UI work was happening on the main thread instead of the compositor thread. The Performance Monitor showed my CPU usage at 5-9% of my Mackbook Pro. Double Yikes.</p>
<p>The Performance Monitor panel pairs nicely with the top-level Performance panel. While the Performance Monitor panel is very high-level, the Performance panel is an in-depth debugging tool where you can inspect a snapshot of your app down to each function and render call.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/perfpanel.jpg" alt="A flame graph inside the Performance Panel in dev tools" /></p>
<p>Capturing a snapshot in the Performance panel confirmed what I was now seeing. I could see the ‚Äúred line of death‚Äù of dropped frames where I locked the main thread. The remediation steps were pretty simple but I did need to strip down and recode how our animation worked.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/articles/animations-guide">Avoid properties that trigger paint or layout</a></li>
<li>Tamp down layout recalcs with <code>contain</code></li>
<li>Use <code>overflow: hidden</code> instead of CSS masks</li>
</ol>
<p>It took a couple of prototypes to shop around a workable solution. The good news is our animation is off-loaded to the compositor instead of the main thread now. CPU use is now at <code>0.2%</code> (down from 5-9%) and our recalcs and layouts are down to <code>0</code> but the animation still chugs along. Truth be told, a loading spinner is a pretty insignificant component and is only temporary, but reducing CPU usage by 10% here makes room for other JavaScript activities‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶ fetching and parsing data.</p>

Adam and I were the leaders of the community. It had been discussed briefly on the mail list. We all recognized that what we were doing needed a name. There was a consensus, it was a small community by then, very collegial. Dave Slusher had already used the term in his podcast (according to <a href="https://podnews.net/article/history-of-word-podcast">James Cridland</a>), so I said in the Trade Secrets show, let's just go ahead and use it. I did mention Ben Hammersley. So he's not out of the story, but he's not the person who gave podcasting its name. September 2004 was the moment when podcasting became something. It's rare in things like this that you can point to a moment, but we can <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=podcast">here</a>, and the record should make that very clear. You could say Hammersley was the first to publish the term in a piece he wrote, but he played no role in the bootstrap. I'd say that by the end of 2004 it was on its way, I basically stepped back and enjoyed the medium along with everyone else. Adam started a company. I would have liked to have started a company then, but it wasn't meant to be. That all happened 20 years ago.

## Bluesky vs Mastodon as open APIs

date: 2024-09-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>The problem with Mastodon is its protocol is underspecified, therefore interop is really hard, and ultimately the standard, if any emerges, will be decided by big tech companies and will be ridiculously complex. </p>
<p>I think Bluesky has a better chance of being a solid standard you can build on, though I find it fairly incomprehensible, but other people seem to understand it well enough, and I've been able to get it to do what I need. Kind of like Amazon's web service APIs. The designers seem smart, and are accessible (a big plus). On the other hand, I've already had apps built on their api break. </p>
<p>Neither one is in a particularly strong position. </p>
<p>Bluesky should factor their API, provide a profile, and a simple API you can adapt to in a weekend, for most common things people want to hook into. And they should commit to not breaking that profile. Their protocol has a lot of generality that gets in the way of doing things that 99% of devs need to do. </p>
<p>Of course Mastodon isn't supposed to be an API, the underlying API was supposed to be ActivityPub, but as I understand, that isn't complete, and they need the functionality now, so they've implemented a REST API for the other stuff. Makes sense, it's what I would do in this situation. On the other hand, that pretty much guarantees that a big part of this interface is going to be deprecated, meaning many developers, myself included, will just wait till we get there. </p>
<p>As I said above I fully expect Meta (ie Facebook) will drive that process, that people will choose to interop with their product over Mastodon and over ActivityPub. Names like "fediverse" get walked over and perverted by big tech companies. We will find ourselves soon talking about the Meta-fediverse and the Masto-fediverse or (somesuch). </p>
<p>I've seen countless of good, clear, solid ideas get muddied by big tech companies. This idea, the fediverse, got completely muddied before the BigCos got involved.  Still more hard work to do, and it must be working <i>together. </i>It doesn't work if people try to throw their non-existent weight around. That's basically with the big companies. </p>

It's a private company so I don't know how much it's growing or how profitable it is, but from outside it's obviously growing and profitable. Basically, charge writers for the service, or lots of services. Little extras you can add to your site. Use it as a hook to sell domain names (huge recurring business). And open source the Medium editor, when it came out it was a breakthrough in usability, and offer it to Google to bundle with Chrome, upgrade the whole web while you're at it. With billions of windfall from the success of Twitter, why argue over nickels and dimes. That's what I always wondered about the thinking behind Medium. Ev had the ability to change the course of the industry, and make the same kind of money Google and Microsoft make. And yes, I did urge him to do <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+medium">all this</a> at the time, publicly (didn't have access to him privately, if you can believe that).

<a href="http://scripting.com/2004/09.html">September 2004</a> was the month when podcasting became a real community thing. <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html">Twenty years ago</a>. I did eight podcasts that month. The mail list, which Adam started, was going strong. This is the month where <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html">podcasting got its name</a>, thanks to some brilliant creativity from Dannie Gregoire. Until then we were calling them "audio blog posts" or some variant thereof. You can see it in this <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=podcast">Google Trends</a> graph. I started a <a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">special feed</a> to echo my programs from 2004, I even got it registered in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298">Apple's podcast</a> database.  There will be two podcasts in the feed today because I missed the one from yesterday. <i>Still diggin!</i>

## SQL Injection Attack on Airport Security

date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting <a href="https://ian.sh/tsa">vulnerability</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;a special lane at airport security called Known Crewmember (KCM). KCM is a TSA program that allows pilots and flight attendants to bypass security screening, even when flying on domestic personal trips.</p>
<p>The KCM process is fairly simple: the employee uses the dedicated lane and presents their KCM barcode or provides the TSA agent their employee number and airline. <a href="https://www.apfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/KCM-Program-Changes_OCT19.pdf">Various forms of ID</a> need to be presented while the TSA agent&#8217;s laptop verifies the employment status with the airline. If successful, the employee can access the sterile area without any screening at all...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-08-22 One Page Dungeon Reviews

date: 2024-09-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-22-one-page-dungeon-reviews">2024-08-22 One Page Dungeon Reviews</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dungeoncontest.com/">One Page Dungeon Contest</a> submissions are being read and discussed by the judges in private but if you have a submission you&rsquo;d like to get a paragraph of review and feedback on, <a href="Contact">let me know</a>. I&rsquo;m happy to write a few words on this page.</p>

<p><a href="https://malachijs.itch.io/sundial-siphon">Sundial Siphon</a>: I love the myconid picture and map; I had to read the part about the rotating map multiple times and I&rsquo;m still not sure it really contributes to the game. Sometimes doors cannot be opened, sometimes some rooms cannot be reached, but I&rsquo;d have to see it at the table. I liked the colour coding of monsters and connections. It says twice &ldquo;Takes some time to clear&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s unclear what the drawback is since there are no random encounters? Is it a quarter rotation? Reading the Siphon makes me think that after 4 phases all player characters are trapped in constructs? That seems rather harsh. The dungeon says that that players are racing against the clock but I think players wouldn&rsquo;t know that, so some sort of warning might be apt? There&rsquo;s a warning in room 4 but I feel a better warning is required, or the siphon should only affect room 5? In any case, the dungeon seems promising! üòÑ</p>

<p><a href="https://peninsulancestral.itch.io/epona-temple">Epona&rsquo;s Temple</a>: I love the idea of achieving a permanent blessing of Epona. The map is beautiful. I feel that the map doesn&rsquo;t make clear which of the obstacles are easy to sidestep. Can people go from 3 to 5 without crossing 4 or 8? In 4 there&rsquo;s a presence of insects but it wasn&rsquo;t clear to mean what that entails since there are no insect stats. From a logic perspective the abandoned camp is puzzling. In any case, the rewards at the end are my favourite thing. They match the premise at the entrance and the theme of the temple itself. Love that. <em>E gostei muito de ver um vers√£o que n√£o seja Inglesa. Muito bem feito!</em> üòÑ</p>

## 2024-08-29 msmtp and app armor

date: 2024-09-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-29-msmtp-and-app-armor">2024-08-29 msmtp and app armor</h1>

<p>I tried to send an email from Emacs and it didn&rsquo;t work. The error was:</p>

<pre><code>msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to reproduce the problem with the following <code>hello.txt</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>From: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
To: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
Subject: Test

This is the test.
</code></pre>

<p>And then feeding that to <code>msmtp</code> with debugging enabled (<code>-d</code>) and reading recipients from the mail (<code>-t</code>):</p>

<pre><code>msmtp -d -t &lt; hello.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Now I had more info, however:</p>

<pre><code>ignoring system configuration file /etc/msmtprc: No such file or directory
ignoring user configuration file /home/alex/.config/msmtp/config: Permission denied
falling back to default account
msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>

<p>I checked permissions, and it was 0600 for the config file.
Online, I found a reference to AppArmor.
Taking a peek at <code>/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp</code> I didn&rsquo;t see anything surprising.
But then I grew suspicious‚Ä¶ I had in fact moved <code>~/.config/msmtp</code> to <code>~/src/home/.config/msmtp</code> (which is a Git repository) and replaced that with a symbolic link. AppArmor didn&rsquo;t like this and decided that <code>msmtp</code> was not allowed to read that other file.
Moving the directory back solved this problem.</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll be making occasional copies of this file into the Git repository. üòí</p>

The networks should put <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C_YWpfXNZq_">Trump on time delay</a> and when he says you can legally murder babies in some states, that should be treated as if he said fuck or shit. Put up a screen that explains why he was cut off, then go to commercial, esp during the debate on Sep 10.

And for some companies, the founder of a company they acquire might make the best CEO when the founder of the original company isn't available. Again Apple is a great example. Steve Jobs ultimately replaced Gil Amelio, after Apple bought NeXT.

Graham uses Steve Jobs as an example. He knew what was and wasn't an Apple product. A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him. Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience, had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he himself wanted it, and that's what made something an Apple product. It's probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the products Jobs created for them. He told <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook">Cook</a> to innovate on his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody would be able to do it. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

Another rule for whoever runs a tech company, they must themselves be a fanatical user of the company's product. They must love it the way a founder loves it. They must think the users are the smartest people in the world because they love the best product in the world. As a founder, I could not visualize the day I left the company for the last time. In hindsight I felt that was the one factor most responsible for the success of the company.

As a founder myself, I think I can tell you why founders have a central role to play as the company grows. They're the only ones who know how the company was built, and what works and what doesn't and how to keep it consistent for customers and partners, and the founder, if the company grew, is tuned into to what makes the company work, and will see opportunities that even well-intentioned managers miss. I remember when a company I was a developer for, early in my career, switched out the founder and replaced him with a professional CEO. The founder had problems managing, and could have used help imho, but -- the founder understood what the company was about, and the professional claimed to be a "market of one" and therefore didn't have an opinion about what products the company should make. That would be delegated to people he hired. Almost as if the people running a company were just modules and servers, and if you needed to grow you just bought new modules. In this case. I can write this because I don't have to get approval from anyone else. I'm sure in a company of today someone would take offense at something I wrote here. That my friends is another reason why companies have a hard time scaling. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>
