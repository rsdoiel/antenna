**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-05-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

My father taught me how to organize my thinking when I was trying to figure out how something works. And that's basically what I've spent my whole life on, figuring out how things work. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

When I log on to meta.ai, <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/01/suggestions.png">these</a> are the suggestions. None of them relate to things I'm thinking about. I haven't been a student or interviewed for a job in decades. But I've been on Facebook for many years, and I had to connect this to my Facebook account to use it, so presumably it knows all that Facebook knows about me, about me. How long before this is customized?

## 2024-04-22 Gopher, again

date: 2024-05-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-22-gopher-again">2024-04-22 Gopher, again</h1>

<p>Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Odd¬µ</a> using a version of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>, the Gemini server I‚Äôm using, based on renderer code I found in the <a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a> that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Odd¬µ, I figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable Gopher pages.</p>

<p>It took some wrangling and it‚Äôs probably not great, but the main menu matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site is back as a gopher hole on port 70!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git">patched Satellite</a> for the Gemini server code, <a href="2023-11-03-other-ports">discussed back in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>And naturally I‚Äôm immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in this client I‚Äôm using.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gopher">#Gopher</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-01</strong>. I think I finally managed to get decent word-wrapping!</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-05-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If you're a blogger, here's something to think about. Whose writing influenced the way you write? Here's my list: Kurt Vonnegut, My uncle Ken (not his writing, rather his way of telling stories), my father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker">Russell Baker</a>, Robert Hunter (lyricist for the Dead), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland">Douglas Coupland</a> (specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs">MicroSerfs</a>), the Suck.com guys, everyone who was writing at Hotwired in 1995. I'll think of others, but those are the ones who come to mind. I have been a constant reader since I was a little kid, so there's a mix of writing styles from authors I don't immediately remember. I should also do one of these lists for who inspired my software.

I'm looking for a quick and easy and ideally free way to upload an MP3 of a podcast and get back a transcript. I have a feeling that a podcast I recorded yesterday will work better as a written document, but I don't have the patience to transcribe it myself. I asked on <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1785442296466747624">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3krf2vjg3nk2w">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/112362620201313010">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C6Zy6uyJRz1">Threads</a>, <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/32dce589-58c8-498b-85bd-c1f9a2c1b892">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.meta.ai/c/6b8ecc0f-2163-4162-aa48-67e32f4260cc">Meta.ai</a>.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/01/waltFrazier.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I have to admit I like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tyrese+maxey">Tyrese Maxey</a> of the Sixers, who <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40061591/amazing-maxey-late-burst-helps-76ers-stay-alive-ot-win-knicks">spoiled a Knicks victory</a> last night that would have closed out the first round of the playoffs. It felt like the Knicks had won the game when Maxie single-handedly pulled the Sixers back into contention. Now the Knicks are up 3-2 with the next game in Philadelphia tomorrow night. But! I didn't flip out this time like I did for the last game, and I think it was because I was able to watch it on <a href="https://www.msgnetworks.com/">local TV</a> with the familiar play by play guy, Mike Breen, and the best color guy for any sport, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+clyde+frazier">Walt Clyde Frazier</a>. If he wasn't flipping out why should I. One of the things I love about his <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=clydisms">narration</a> is that he uses words incorrectly, kind of like <a href="https://thelastdrivein.com/2015/07/02/the-archie-bunker-malapropism-dictionary-of-mangled-english/">Archie Bunker</a>. I keep wanting to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means">say</a> "I do not think it means what you think it means," but then I realized, last night, for the first time, it's freaking poetry! A lot of it even rhymes. And it's a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do. Unfortunately I don't think the MSG crew is going to be doing the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=nba+schedule&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;">next game</a>. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN. Maybe it's because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It's all totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend asked, if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan">owner</a> of the Knicks wasn't a putz. I said of course, he's the worst but, the Knicks now are being well managed. So maybe he's mellowed out a bit?

## Sayers the middlebrow writer

Robert Graves and Alan Hodge, in The Lost Week-End (1940), their generally fascinating and informative social history of Great Britain between the world wars, make a great many Olympian pronouncements. They say, for instance, that Auden ‚Äúperhaps never wrote an original line,‚Äù a claim that, to the person who has read even a handful of [&#8230;]

<p>So I know I‚Äôve been really quiet on here for a while, but since my fatigue has improved massively, and we‚Äôve now done the early scans and tests to confirm things are progressing well, I guess I can post this‚Ä¶ üòÖ</p>
<p>I am pregnant! Viv and I are expecting around Halloween. We had our first ultrasound last week and got to see Baby waving their arms about, annnnnd yeah. It&rsquo;s nerve-wracking and scary but exciting, and while I don&rsquo;t intend it to become the ONLY thing I post about, it&rsquo;s definitely a big thing happening in my life right now. It feels weird to say ‚ÄúI&rsquo;m hoping to get back into social media&quot; (even when this encompasses IndieWeb microblogging) but uhhhh&hellip; kinda. Haha. Anyway, that‚Äôs my big news!</p>

## Polaroids, memories, associations

Haven&#8217;t thought of this song in decades probably but it popped into my head at dinner. Wild how lyrics become etched into the subconscious.

## The 50th Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop

For a crew of volunteers to keep a small, invitation-only, off-the-record workshop going for half a century is an amazing achievement. A lot of the credit goes to the late <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/11/john-wharton-rip.html">John H. Wharton</a>, who chaired it from 1985 to 2017 with one missing year. He was responsible for the current format, and the eclecticism of the program's topics.<br />
<br />
Brian Berg has written a short history of the workshop for the IEEE entitled <a href="https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/events/asilomar-microcomputer-workshop"><i>The Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop: Its Origin Story, and Beyond</i></a>. It was started by "Three Freds and a Ted" and one of the Freds, Fred Coury has also written about it in <a href="https://amw.org/a-short-history-of-amw-by-fred-coury/">here</a>.Six years ago David Laws wrote <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-asilomar-microcomputer-workshop-and-the-billion-dollar-toilet-seat/"><i>The Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop and the Billion Dollar Toilet Seat</i></a> for the Computer History Museum.<br />
<br />
I have attended almost all of them since 1987. I have been part of the volunteer crew for many, including this one, and have served on the board of the 501C3 behind the workshop for some years.<br />
<br />
This year's <a href="https://amw.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prog24.pdf">program</a> featured a keynote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Patt">Yale Patt</a>, and a session from four of his ex-students, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shebanow">Michael Shebanow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen-mei_Hwu">Wen-mei Hwu</a>, <a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf">Onur Mutlu</a> and Wen-Ti Liu. Other talks came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvy_Ray_Smith">Alvy Ray Smith</a> based on his book <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1163953124"><i>A Biography of the Pixel</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lou_Jepsen">Mary Lou Jepsen</a> on <a href="openwater.health">OpenWater</a>, her attempt to cost-reduce diagnosis and treatment, and Brandon Holland and Jaden Cohen, two high-school students on applying AI to the Prisoner's Dilemma. I interviewed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Malachowsky">Chris Malachowsky</a> about the history of <a href="https://nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a>. And, as always, the RATS (Rich Asilomar Tradition Session) in which almost everyone gives a 10-minute talk lasted past midnight.<br />
<br />
The workshop is strictly off-the-record unless the speaker publishes it elsewhere, so I can't discuss the content of the talks.<br />

## It's different after its gone

date: 2024-04-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>Note: This post is the summary of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/30/weNeedMoreChange.m4a">podcast</a>. </i></p>
<p>When my mother died in 2018, it didn't settle in that the context in which I lived, my whole life, was gone. </p>
<p>She lived in the house I was raised in. Very little had changed in that house. I hadn't lived there since I went away to college, but it still defined who I was, an adult who didn't live in his childhood home. When we sold the house, the last time I saw it, it was empty, and that was when it hit me. That part of my life is over. I no longer have a home I can return to.</p>
<p>The same is true with our understanding of who we are as adult American citizens. Until now we felt we had a vote. But that is over, unless we change our view of the country we live in. It's not that it's about to change, which is what you hear in the news, and on social web -- <i>it has already changed. </i></p>
<p>We now understand that Trump may be above the law but that masks a bigger truth, the Supreme Court is already above the law. They take bribes, openly. They cannot be prosecuted (just try it and see what happens). They openly side with the insurrection, yet don't recuse when deciding issues of what to do with the insurrectionists. They imagine the president is a monarch. </p>
<p>We're already living in the authoritarian state we're worried about. We haven't caught up with that reality yet. </p>
<p>Our government is more concerned about our right to own guns than it is with our right to own our own bodies. Stop for a moment and let that sink in. If I said you don't own your own body, what would you think I'm talking about? Answer: Slavery. </p>
<p>If we did catch up with that reality, we would start organizing now to undo that mistake. We would not only re-elect Biden in a landslide, but we'd insist that he expand the court to 100 members serving 10-year terms each, retroactive. And thus we would eliminate one of the huge problems in our system of government. Have they proved they need this kind of correction? Yes, the overturning of Roe, and the lack of prosecution of Trump for trying to overthrow the government are all the proof we need. </p>
<p>And from then-on, no politician in any branch of government would take us for granted.</p>

## What to say to a Republican who complains about the federal debt.

Friends, Republicans are attacking Biden for expanding the federal debt, and the House &#8220;Freedom Caucus&#8221; is livid that Speaker Mike Johnson has agreed to more funds for Ukraine, claiming it will expand the debt even further. Can we just have some sanity here?

And they don't take the bait to make it about anything other than what happens on the court, and to trust in the league to take care of players who don't play by the rules. And <i>of course</i> the Philadelphia arena was full of Knicks fans. The tickets cost a lot less than NYC tickets, and it's only 2 hours away by car, and there's good train service. If the series goes back to Philadelphia, the same thing will happen. I feel sorry for fans of small town teams, because no matter where you go in the US, there are always lots of Knicks fans.

## Whale Song Code

date: 2024-04-29, updated: 2024-04-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>During the Cold War, the US Navy tried to make a <a href="https://www.twz.com/8778/the-u-s-navy-tried-to-turn-whale-songs-into-secret-code">secret code</a> out of whale song.</p>
<blockquote><p>The basic plan was to develop coded messages from recordings of whales, dolphins, sea lions, and seals. The submarine would broadcast the noises and a computer&#8212;the Combo Signal Recognizer (CSR)&#8212;would detect the specific patterns and decode them on the other end. In theory, this idea was relatively simple. As work progressed, the Navy found a number of complicated problems to overcome, the bulk of which centered on the authenticity of the code itself.</p>
<p>The message structure couldn&#8217;t just substitute the moaning of a whale or a crying seal for As and Bs or even whole words. In addition, the sounds Navy technicians recorded between 1959 and 1965 all had natural background noise. With the technology available, it would have been hard to scrub that out. Repeated blasts of the same sounds with identical extra noise would stand out to even untrained sonar operators...</p></blockquote>

## Thoughts on Cosmotechnics

date: 2024-04-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>A fine post by Ethan Marcotte called <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-negotiation-cycle/"><em>The negotiation cycle</em></a> led me to an incredible essay by Alan Jacobs called <a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/from-tech-critique-to-ways-of-living"><em>From Tech Critique to Ways of Living</em></a>. It references an old idea called ‚ÄúThe SCT<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>‚Äù which is new to me but based on thinking by the likes of Ursula Franklin and Neil Postman who I am familiar with. Neil Postman‚Äôs <em>Technopoly</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> ‚Äìwhich I read in March‚Äì was one of the best books on technology I‚Äôve ever read, so this is relevant for me.</p>
<p>Jacobs‚Äô essay takes an unexpected yet welcome turn towards Daoism linking to a heavier essay by Yuk Hui called <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/"><em>Cosmotechnics and Cosmopolitics</em></a>. I‚Äôm not smart enough to fully understand all these philosophical (epistemological?) arguments<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>, but reading the word ‚Äúcosmotechnics‚Äù felt like a beacon in the night for a concept I‚Äôve intuitively felt but never had a word to describe. In Hui‚Äôs words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me give you a preliminary definition of cosmotechnics: it is the unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities, whether craft-making or art-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that science and technology are moral. Try as we may to divorce a tool from an outcome, there is always an interplay. As a contrived example, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component and it would by itself be morally neutral. But if I make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that someone with a disability cannot use, then I have made a moral decision through either action or inaction. Similarly, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that puts a stuffed animal in a digital shopping cart, that is morally neutral. But if that stuffed animal is knowingly assembled with child labor and dropshipped from afar with an immense carbon cost relative to the value of the item, I have made an immoral <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code>. It‚Äôs not hard for me to imagine that someone somewhere is making a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component that launches a nuclear missile‚Ä¶</p>
<p>In the words of Dr. King from his sermon <em><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/">The Three Evils of Society</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWhen scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided missiles and misguided men.‚Äù<br />
‚Äì Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you believe technology is moral, then the next larger follow up question is ‚ÄúWhose morals?‚Äù</p>
<hr />
<p>This question of ‚ÄúWhose morals?‚Äù permeates my thoughts, specifically in regards to global challenges like climate change. Call me unpatriotic, but I don‚Äôt think rugged American individualism is going to manifest destiny our way out of the climate crisis. A technological breakthrough seems unlikely. We need to rely on the knowledge and experiences of African, Asian, and Indigenous societies who have a different ontology, a different Dao (a code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural order); one that prioritizes the group over the individual. In less metaphysical terms, I believe we need to listen to societies built on cooperation and sharing of limited resources over societies built on the continuous expansion of dominion through exploitation of markets, labor, and people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need a new language of cosmopolitics to elaborate this new world order that goes beyond a single hegemon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Hui that a singular perspective cannot and will not solve the current crisis we are facing. Technology alone will not save us. We need scientific power in the hands of moral-powered men and women. And the longer we wait the more we risk erasing the communities and ancient knowledge we need to find an equitable solution.</p>
<hr />
<p>Climate change, geopolitical conflict, the rise of authoritarianism brought about by social media companies‚Ä¶ these are all large problems that take governments decades to solve. That puts cosmotechnics far away from me, a would-be practitioner. Hui thankfully provides a story from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">Zhuangzi</a></em>; the butcher Pao Ding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pao Ding is excellent at butchering cows. He claims that the key to being a good butcher doesn‚Äôt lie in mastering certain skills, but rather in comprehending the Dao. Replying to a question from Duke Wen Huei about the Dao of butchering cows, Pao Ding points out that having a good knife is not necessarily enough; it is more important to understand the Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter into the gaps between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of web development I like. It agrees with me. I better understand the <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao of web design</a>. Our apps and websites are like water, flowing in and out of viewports. Contextualizing themselves to the recipient‚Äôs limitations or preferences. Those who find the easier paths through the gaps become excellent butchers of websites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pao Ding adds that a good butcher has to change his knife once a year because he cuts through tendons, while a bad butcher has to change his knife every month because he cuts through bones. Pao Ding, on the other hand‚Äîan¬†<em>excellent</em>¬†butcher‚Äîhas not changed his knife in nineteen years, and it looks as if it has just been sharpened with a whetstone. Whenever Pao Ding encounters any difficulty, he slows down the knife and gropes for the right place to move further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another translation I read phrased the bad butcher as ‚Äúhacking‚Äù through bones and what a serviceable metaphor we‚Äôve found! The knife, a technology. The medium, a cow or software. Our tools will last longer if we learn how to slow down and understand the nature of the medium, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">the grain</a>, rather than hacking against it.</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of capitalism and keeping up with the zeitgeist makes this hard. There‚Äôs a pressure to keep up, lest you fall off the cliff of irrelevance. After all, technology always only advances and there‚Äôs always a better knife in the distance‚Ä¶ right?</p>
<p>Over the years I‚Äôve heard myself referred to as a ‚Äúcurmudgeon‚Äù, ‚Äúold guard‚Äù, ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù, and ‚Äúdinosaur‚Äù. That is due in part to my loudmouthed punditry but also because I dislike a specific technology from an <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">immoral company</a> that does our industry, society, and users irreparable harm. Moving fast and rethinking best practices spawned untold lifetimes worth of human hours dedicated to knife swapping each year. And when tools dull, we throw stones at each other.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve always been overly cautious and considered in the tools I use but I‚Äôve never thought of the tools I use as  a moral choice. Perhaps now I will. I‚Äôm not a Daoist by any means, but this idea of <em>cosmotechnics</em> begins to provide a mental framework for expressing the relationship between technology and morality. From the large scale of the cosmos to the small scale of the knife, I‚Äôm glad to have vocabulary to think about future problems.</p>

<p>My library‚Äôs copy of <em>Technoloply</em> had a copyright date of 2012. A ten year old book being so relevant to me in 2024 was impressive. But that was the reprint date!

We shouldn‚Äôt use new technology to reinstate old Cold War era superpowers of oppression. We need something entirely new.

Let&#8217;s be clear about a few things. Antisemitism should have no place in America &#8212; not on college campuses or anywhere else.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/09/bowHunter.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">These days I'm using the moderation tools on the social web more than I did in the past. If someone I don't know posts a negative comment on Facebook, in response to something I posted, I just delete it, because they have that feature (other systems don't, they should). Any lurker who happens by is free to enjoy what I write. But if I don't know you, I honestly don't care what you think, esp if it's negative and has less than ten syllables total. It's hit and run spam for sure. I'm widening my definition of spam all the time. If you add up all the responses that actually mean anything, it doesn't amount to much. Let's see what the social web looks like without hearing from all assholes.
