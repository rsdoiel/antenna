**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-01-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Has anyone come up with a variant of JSON that allows comments? I've started using names like "comment1" etc to shoehorn comments in. A complete hack, impossible to maintain over time. The idea of not being able to put notes in your config.json files is absolutely ridiculous.

## The latest language in the GNU Compiler Collection: Algol-68

      <p>A 37-year-old compiler is gaining support for a new language… although as that language is 57 years old, we are possibly stretching the adjective &#34;new&#34; more than our post-holiday waistband.</p>

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2025-01-07, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>Remember the other day, when I said I was a sucker for the character archetype of the harsh and menacing man with a heart of gold? This morning I was reading some discussion on the Sixth Doctor (from Doctor Who), whose TV era I actually really enjoyed when I watched it age 13, and most of the comments were like &ldquo;he sucks because he&rsquo;s mean to Peri&rdquo; and I was like damn… I think that&rsquo;s why I liked him? Interesting to realise I was attracted to this character type even then, haha!</p>

## The Health Care Mess

date: 2025-01-06, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

My wife and I are moving upward through The Final Demographic. Productively: working, traveling, doing stuff. But we are dealing with some of the usual infirmities required by aging, which means we are intimately involved (mostly in very slow motion) with what we generously call U.S. health care system. And, of course, discussions about it. [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-01-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/27/duck.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The great thing about using a system like MySQL (or any SQL for that matter) is that it's been around for so long that if you can think of something that would be nice to have, you can be sure it's there somewhere. They've had enough time not only to hit all the walls, but to try out different approaches and settle on one. Maybe at times there were competing ways to do things, like the way Bluesky and ActivityPub, and probably Threads, and certainly Facebook and Twitter insist on reinventing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. But when I ask ChatGPT "can you do this in MySQL" it gives me one or two ways to do it, but usually just one. These are things I never would have found in the old Google-search way of finding answers. An example, I wanted to find out if there was a MySQL way to query a value inside a JSON object, and the answer is (of course) yes. And you can create an index on such a value. I didn't even ask for it, ChatGPT volunteered, guessing it would be my next question (it was). Whatever happened in the evolution of SQL it was a lot healthier than what's going on now in the social web, where the creators completely ignored what came before, and each other, and as a result there's a proliferation of different ways to do things we've known how to do for <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html">over 20 years</a>. SQL has been around for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#History">50</a>, so maybe they went through this stage and emerged from it with a better answer. This feels a bit like the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/677bf6d0-b868-8012-af56-7e4449e9182f">Fermi paradox</a> and I'm a time traveler who has managed to witness 50 years of evolution long after the fact, any day of any week I want to thanks to ChatGPT. Also this is why it is so important to keep the archives of the 1990's web preserved. We may need to loop back to this when the people responsible for the social web decide that interop is important as opposed to each of them going it alone.

Just thinking out loud here. Working with a group of people. It's possible it's just the author and editor, or it could be a larger documentation job, or a report covering a lot of ground. In 2025 we'd use AI to find the threads in our writing, to maintain a book outline that changes as our writing goes forward. Gone is the problem of writing a chapter structure before doing any writing. I've always found that to be a real obstacle to getting started. I've yet to use a ChatGPT-like service to do this, but I expect it can be done. I'm thinking about how I can set up an experiment for <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> for writing this kind of book. The first test case could be the docs for WordLand. I would write a post about a feature as I thought about it, but not worry about how it fits into the rest of the book. Trust the AI organizer to help us do something sensible.

## 2025-01-06 Asking for change, politely

date: 2025-01-06, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-06-asking-for-change-politely">2025-01-06 Asking for change, politely</h1>

<p>It seems to me that when the powerful are terrible people and the weak are trying to articulate their anger, to organize, to get a mass movement going, asking them to politely make their case and letting other people make up their mind is not OK. By telling people not to fight for their rights but to just politely make their point and then shut up one aligns with the powerful, one dismisses the methods of resistance.</p>

<p>To get a feel for absurd this is, I remember a cartoon I once saw where American natives gave the conquistadores a list of complaints; where black Americans gave white Americans a list of civil rights they were asking for; and so on. And in all cases, the oppressor answered, &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; or something to that effect and instituted the necessary changes.</p>

<p>It never works that way.</p>

<p>For the oppressed to organize, they need the right to speak, to organize, to meet, to protest.</p>

<p>For the oppressor to get spurred into action, it needs to hurt.</p>

<p>These days, that means that protests must lead to costs. Otherwise they&rsquo;re ignored. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Therefore, protest disrupts the economy, disrupts the flow of goods, damages property. If it doesn&rsquo;t cost, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt. If it doesn&rsquo;t hurt, it isn&rsquo;t felt.</p>

<p>Also consider all the political theatre that goes on. You can be part of a grass-roots organisation and fight for change. As far as the situation in Switzerland is concerned, the government might even invite you to comment on new draft legislation. But you&rsquo;re not going to get to write the proposals. You&rsquo;re not going to change the system by participating in meetings. At that point, you&rsquo;re part of the long arm of the government reaching into civil society, there to confirm that they have made the right choices, to do your part in the public performance to assure the rest of us that everything is OK, everybody has been heard and all points of view have been accounted for. At that point, it&rsquo;s too late for change.</p>

<p>The opportunity for change is to be a threat to the establishment, to undermine the seats of politicians, to cast doubt on their reliability, to make them unelectable. Then the government starts moving and writes new proposals to be confirmed by the political theatre in front of a changed audience.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://climatejustice.social/@danahilliot" title="@danahilliot@climatejustice.social">@danahilliot</a> has a blog post (in French) called <a href="https://outsiderland.com/danahilliot/public-participation-as-empty-performance-of-democracy/">Public participation as empty performance of democracy</a> discussing Melissa Checker&rsquo;s book, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nyu-press-scholarship-online/book/37574?login=false">The Sustainability Myth: Environmental Gentrification and the Politics of Justice</a>, NYC University Press, 2020, in which she dismantles the procedures of “public debates with citizens”.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@samiamsam" title="@samiamsam@mastodon.social">@samiamsam</a> reminded me that &ldquo;people need to read <a href="https://letterfromjail.com/">Letter from a Birmingham Jail</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. &ndash; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find the actual letter to be more interesting to read than the summary on Wikipedia.</p>

They look for prior art and implement it and they don't deprecate. They're still running the APIs we invented for blogging before WordPress even existed. The philosophy is "Let's not argue about decisions made a long time ago, because <i>we want interop." </i>People have all kinds of harsh things to say about their leadership, but unless you're a developer you don't understand that the reason it works is that they have a different code for their code, the only way we get interop is by <a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod">not re-inventing</a>. There are two competing ways to do things in tech. The blogging world has been taken over by the re-inventors, like the Bluesky people. They make a nice product, but honestly they don't reallllly want us to work with them, or we wouldn't be having this friction. Their API is bullshit. Plain and simple. They even thought of using RSS constructs and decided to reinvent the whole thing. There are places to innovate, like new freedom for users and developers, or there are ways to create <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html">hamster cages</a> where everyone <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hamster+cage+site%3Ascripting.com">gets</a> to run around in a very tightly defined space, that's fun. That's what Twitter was about, and that's what Bluesky is doing too. At some point we're really going to break free of this mess, but this isn't that time, yet.

Makes our apps more expensive to maintain, and we waste time and human wear and tear on stupid bullshit make-work. Developers are people, and our work is already horribly overly complex, we're working at the edge of comprehension, and what the fukc let's throw some more unnecessary complication into the mix. Arrogance, narcissism, whatever the source is, it's not a good way to introduce yourself. And, even better, after you go through the maze they break it, with an error message about <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/1d0b3163a8441a98e6098a29393ac834">legacy blob</a> bullshit. They've already done this, and they're just getting started. It's why I say they should just adapt to RSS instead of trying to force us to adapt to them. I'll do it one more time, and then that's it. They can fix my code next time they break it.

## S3 bucket configuration for Wagtail

date: 2025-01-05, updated: 2025-01-05, from: Cynthia Kiser's blog

We host our websites in Docker containers using Fargate on AWS. This means we don’t have a permanent file system so we need to use S3 to store the media files our users upload. Fortunately there is a Django package to add a variety of different file storage options, including S3. Setting up S3 via django-storages is pretty straightforward - install the package, configure storages.backends.s3.S3Storage as the storage backend, and include AWS access information in your environment variables.
