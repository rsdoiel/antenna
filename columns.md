**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/05/21/stillAVirgin.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I theorized why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a> is disappointed with Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">on Bluesky</a>. I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he's a human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or bad. If my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">theory</a> is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it's a valid point, Bluesky was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically making a global object storage system with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It can't hurt to talk about what-if's instead of barrelling down the same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00's. I've been writing about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let's start talking about how we break out, because it's not going to "just happen" organically.

I look forward to the day when I can link to a topic I've written about on my blog without having to depend on Google. I don't think they know I have a blog or have any respect for it. Actually I know they don't have any respect for it. That's why depending on them for access to it seems too flimsy to build on.

## Python Developers Targeted with Malware During Fake Job Interviews

date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting social engineering attack: luring potential job applicants with fake recruiting pitches, trying to <a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/fake-recruiter-coding-tests-target-devs-with-malicious-python-packages">convince them</a> to download malware. From a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/python-developers-targeted-by-north-korean-lazarus-group-with-fake-jobs-and-malware-disguised-as-coding-tests">news article</a></p>
<blockquote><p>These particular attacks from North Korean state-funded hacking team Lazarus Group are new, but the overall malware campaign against the Python development community has been running since at least August of 2023, when a number of popular open source Python tools were maliciously duplicated with added malware. Now, though, there are also attacks involving &#8220;coding tests&#8221; that only exist to get the end user to install hidden malware on their system (cleverly hidden with Base64 encoding) that allows remote execution once present. The capacity for exploitation at that point is pretty much unlimited, due to the flexibility of Python and how it interacts with the underlying OS...</p></blockquote>

## Why do blogging and fiction writing use different creative energy?

date: 2024-09-16, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Both blogs and books are written for an audience, but blogs are a dialogue, while fiction is a narrative. I use blogging as a tool for thinking and making meaning. Fiction writing is not itself a sense-making process for me, but told out of &#8212; after &#8212; sense-making. Blog posts construct an argument as they [&#8230;]

I started out that way 40+ years ago, and somewhere along the line I stopped thinking that way. If you can, watch <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/the-bear/video-extras/video/64beaaa830c49e0001e758d8">S02 E07</a> to see what I mean. It's about service, the connection between the staff and the people who come to eat, and the medium is the food. It's the same idea. There's so much cynicism around tech, and I hate that. We've rarely seen it as a human thing both by the people who make the meals and the people who love great food. The world thinks of it as billionaires and influencers and lying fascist politicians. But it should be much more than that.

Has it ever been suggested that journalists take an oath, similar to the one <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C8-1/ALDE_00001126/">the President takes</a> to: "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." Could be voluntary. Sports reporters might take a different oath.

## How I cross-post to Threads

date: 2024-09-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Twitter, WordPress and RSS. </p>
<p>Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,</p>
<p><a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">The RSS feed</a> is doing a lot of the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Links from the RSS feed show up on my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links page</a> and in the <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly emails</a>.</li>
<li>The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through micro.blog. I am able to <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">give</a> it the <a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">URL</a> of the linkblogging feed, and then click on <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png">Add Threads</a> -- and that's it. When I post something to the feed it shows up on Threads. </li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most people don't know it's there. It's sort of a Grand Central station for moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you're a micro.blog user, its <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">Feeds page</a> is where you set it up. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/microblogScreen.png">Screen shot</a>.</p>

## The future of software? Imagine a bot, stamping on a human face – forever

date: 2024-09-16, updated: 2024-09-16, from: Liam Proven's articles at the Register

<h4><span class="label">Part 1</span> Automation is driving the next wave of commoditization, threatening to replace skilled workers</h4>
      <p>As we have said before, the software industry has a decades-long history of cost-cutting, commoditization, and a successful sales model of "pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap." This has worrying consequences if your skill set is the next one to be commoditized. But there may be ways out of this narrowing commercial bottleneck.</p>

## Zaurus on Internet

date: 2024-09-16, from: Jirka's blog

I still  have the SHARP  Zaurus SL-C3200. A  cute tiny clamshell  PDA - actually  a tiny  Linux  laptop. I  have  got it  when  it was  already obsolete and  used it little.  It's the  most expensive model  with the biggest RAM (128  MB, I think), the bigges storage  space (the 6GB HDD) and - of course - the biggest power consumption.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I was recruited to speak at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti">Ria Novosti</a> conference in Moscow in June 2011, but decided not to go. This was back when we thought naively that Russia was a democracy, and working with Russian journalists, when American journalists wouldn't, seemed like a fair deal. Something about it didn't smell right though, so I stayed home.

For me, Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for ActivityPub but that's more complicated than it may seem. As often is the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn't work, when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users, completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I think it's better if we, as users, remain diversified.

## Ignore polls

date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>You'll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been in every presidential election because then they'd have to fire half their political reporters. </p>
<p>If you want a better idea of how it's going, look at where the ad dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning. </p>
<p>And make sure all your friends know that you're voting and who you're voting for. I think that makes a difference. </p>
<p>I'm voting straight Democratic party line.</p>

If ChatGPT had a simple, non-AI scrapbook, like the old Mac OS had, where you could just throw something over your shoulder so you can find it later with a text search, that would make it a lot more useful for retaining practices that work. It's a shame to work something out, come up with the answer that worked, and then to have to do it all over again 23 months later when you encounter the same problem.
