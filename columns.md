## Rustic Co-op City

## New Attack on VPNs

date: 2024-05-07, updated: 2024-05-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>This <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/">attack</a> has been feasible for over two decades:</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers have devised an attack against nearly all virtual private network applications that forces them to send and receive some or all traffic outside of the encrypted tunnel designed to protect it from snooping or tampering.</p>
<p>TunnelVision, as the researchers have named their attack, largely negates the entire purpose and selling point of VPNs, which is to encapsulate incoming and outgoing Internet traffic in an encrypted tunnel and to cloak the user&#8217;s IP address. The researchers believe it affects all VPN applications when they&#8217;re connected to a hostile network and that there are no ways to prevent such attacks except when the user&#8217;s VPN runs on Linux or Android. They also said their attack technique may have been possible since 2002 and may already have been discovered and used in the wild since then...</p></blockquote>

## Burning to Write. And Vice Versa.

date: 2024-05-07, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Among all artists, writers alone suffer the illusion that the world needs to hear what they have to say. I thought that line, or something like it, came from Rollo May, probably in The Courage to Create. But a search within that book says no. ChatGPT and Gemini both tell me May didn&#8217;t say it [&#8230;]

## Raspberry Pi is getting into the services game

date: 2024-05-07, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Raspberry Pi is getting into the services game</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>...and it's all free—<em>so far</em>.</p>

<p><img class="insert-image" width="700" height="auto" alt="Raspberry Pi Connect Beta Logo" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-connect-logo.jpg"></p>

<p>Raspberry Pi today launched <a href="https://connect.raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi Connect</a>, a free remote VPN service for all Pi OS users.</p>

<p>If you create a <a href="https://id.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi ID</a>, you can sign up for Connect, install <code>rpi-connect</code> on a Pi 4 or 5 running 64-bit Pi OS 12 'Bookworm', and register that Pi with the service.</p>

<p>Then, on any other device's web browser, you can log in and remote control your Pi through Connect's web-based VNC viewer.</p>

<p><img class="insert-image" width="700" height="auto" alt="Raspberry Pi Connect Demo" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-connect-demo.jpg"></p>

<p>The VNC server is based on <a href="https://github.com/any1/wayvnc">wayvnc</a>, and the Connect service allows for as many registered Pis as you want (though I'm guessing the interface is optimized for the majority use case of one or a few).</p></div>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-05-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW, I was struck that famous editor and writer <a href="https://mastodon.social/@semaforben@threads.net">Ben Smith</a> said he was ashamed at starting out as a blogger, on an MSNBC show hosted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Scarborough">true hack</a>. The quote was from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399386648851185">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who like me, <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140303">cross-posts</a> to a variety of social webs, presumably manually. Where did I put my comment? Hell if I know. Heh I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399484570566051">found</a> it. My comment: "I didn’t know he had been a blogger. So my respect for him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant, plummeted. What’s wrong with people?" Bad news for Ben, he's still is a blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true bloggers share an ethos that the fakers like Morning Joe will never understand. So I guess when you're on with Joe you have to pander. Just remember Ben, we know who you are. Even if you have forgotten. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

Part of me would like to send the sentence and the review to my freshman English professor, I think she would be proud. Instead I decided to blog it.

## Getting Back Into the Sims Games

date: 2024-05-07, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I&rsquo;ve felt this rising tide of nostalgia building up in me and urging me to revisit the <cite>Sims</cite> games. I used to be an avid player of <cite>The Sims 2</cite> in the late 2000s and early 2010s, playing legacy challenges (where you strive to play the same family over 10 generations) and participating in the thriving LiveJournal Sims community of the era. Around the time this nostalgic impulse started, I stumbled upon a corner of Reddit where people are still talking about, and playing, <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, and that in turn got me sucked into YouTube videos such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpEVeAeyWJHOpjr8FOkf7WTwB5YrNJ8VX">Tanic Sims 2&rsquo;s series on the borked character files of the premade hoods<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cB67DGDXFQ">this two-hour masterpiece by April Black<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> on the scourge of hood corruption, and how many of the things Simmers long thought cause it actually don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Anyway, it made me really want to play <cite>The Sims 2</cite> again. I do actually own the Ultimate Collection via <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> Origin, but there was a slight problem&hellip; the computer I use is a Mac. And we do have a Linux desktop as well, and these days Wine/Proton/etc. is so good that <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> can easily be played on that <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> now&hellip; but somehow that install of Linux got borked and only works in recovery mode, which is sufficient to run the Plex server I mainly use that desktop for these days, but not really good enough for <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. Alas.</p>
<p>Another option would have been to purchase Aspyr&rsquo;s Mac port – the Super Collection – for AUD$50 in the App Store. I do want to admit that in principle (even though I already own the game on another platform) this seems like a worthy option. Unlike <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>, Aspyr has actually put the effort in to keep their port updated for new versions of Mac OS, including upgrading the game to 64 bits when Apple dropped support for 32-bit applications, and updating the game again to run natively on Apple Silicon (the M1 chips and beyond). That&rsquo;s great and they deserve to be supported for that! My reasons for not just choosing that option are a bit on the selfish and picky side. Firstly, <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> never allowed Aspyr to port the last couple of expansion packs (<cite>FreeTime</cite> and <cite>Apartment Life</cite>) to Mac OS, and <cite>FreeTime</cite> in particular is so fundamental to all my nostalgic memories of the game (plus, packed with quality of life features) that I just don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m willing to play without it. Secondly, the April Black video I linked in paragraph #1 introduced me to the fact that Macs have a hardcoded limit of approximately 10,000 files that can be open at one time&hellip; which can be a potential cause of corruption in <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which was designed to draw on a large number of tiny, atomic files (e.g. every Sim in a neighbourhood gets its own individual file) instead of large consolidated ones. Considering that on top of that, I have a folder of all the custom content I was using at the time I stopped playing <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which I actually think is pretty lean, and yet by itself it has 4,242 files in it&hellip; yeah, I was nervous about the possibility that playing <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on a Mac would not be very sustainable for me. Alas.</p>
<p>So, I turned my sights to the newest instalment of the franchise, <cite>The Sims 4</cite>. Now I played this version of the game quite a bit in 2017–8, and I remember being impressed at first by the graphics (it&rsquo;s <em>so</em> much prettier than unmodded <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>) and the quality of life improvements offered by the game engine, like better routing and Sims&rsquo; new ability to multitask. However&hellip; the shine wore off. The main issue I had with <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> was just that it wasn&rsquo;t as <strong>fun</strong> as <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. The zany shit that used to keep me so entertained as a teen was just so much rarer in <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr>. Most Sims&rsquo; personalities were so bland, with personality points gone and replaced with just <strong>three</strong> traits (plus an aspiration trait) and no more than a handful of those traits did anything more than &ldquo;give Sims an emotion buff sometimes&rdquo;. There were no more wants and fears, just &ldquo;whims&rdquo; which were rarely interesting, and nothing bad happened if you ignored them entirely (Sims couldn&rsquo;t go into aspiration failure any more). So&hellip; I started playing a legacy in <cite>The Sims 4</cite> and did get up to generation 6. After a couple of fun generations where I really put effort into making my Sims generate drama, I got a generation where my heir had TRIPLETS and my entire game became a production line of desperately trying to build up the toddlers&rsquo; potty training skill to the point that they could at least fucking toilet themselves and it was literally a neverending process and none of my adult Sims were doing anything interesting either and I got so frustrated that I just&hellip; never opened the game again. 😅</p>
<p>That said, quite a few years have passed since 2017–8. It occurred to me that more mods might&rsquo;ve come out giving the Sims more personality and making their autonomous behaviour more individualised. It also seems like the game itself has come out with updates addressing some of the stuff I criticised (for example they supposedly replaced whims with wants &amp; fears again, and as of a recent expansion Sims can &ldquo;self-discover&rdquo; new traits?)&hellip; basically, I started to wonder if it was worth trying again.</p>
<p>So, I installed the base game via the Origin app (which supposedly already booted off everyone in favour of <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>&rsquo;s new app, but it hasn&rsquo;t booted <em>me</em> off) and started a new save. I haven&rsquo;t got very far into it yet, and I&rsquo;m also adding mods progressively, bit by bit, rather than adding <strong>every</strong> &ldquo;give your Sim more personality!&rdquo; mod all at once, to make the investigation easier for myself if I inadvertently add something bugged or something that conflicts with another mod. That said, some of the mods I&rsquo;m interested in playing with are:</p>

</ul>
<p>Now, having said all of this&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure how much it&rsquo;ll satisfy that part of me nostalgic for the Sims community on LiveJournal. Because a big part of my fun wasn&rsquo;t just <em>playing my game</em>, it was publishing updates on my legacy and – perhaps even more important – reading other people&rsquo;s updates on their legacy. There are sooooo many hilarious people whose legacies I used to read – hell, I started reading them even before I owned a Windows computer to play <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on myself! – and I really also miss&hellip; that. For nostalgia&rsquo;s sake I went back to revisit some of them today, but between Tinypic purging old pictures, Photobucket watermarking old pictures, and LiveJournal itself becoming a gross ad-infested shell of what it once was, it was just sad. I can put together legacy updates for myself, and I can publish them on the internet (I even have <a href="https://sims.jayeless.net">a dedicated subdomain<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>, originally to host my pictures, but when LJ went downhill I started backing up the actual updates there too), but&hellip; I have no idea where a Simmer <em>shares</em> these things, these days, for potential interested readers to find. At least in 2017–8, I knew Tumblr was popular, but I tried searching tags like &ldquo;sims 4 legacy&rdquo;, &ldquo;sims 4 gameplay&rdquo; and so forth today and did not find a single &ldquo;legacy update&rdquo; as I would think of them. Mostly I found custom content, people posting their own challenge rules based on the original legacy challenge, and the occasional &ldquo;artsy&rdquo; highly edited screenshot with no or minimal commentary. I don&rsquo;t really want contextless game screenshots&hellip; I want funny shit. I want quirky Sims autonomously starting drama and being hilarious! Where is that?! Or does everyone who wants that just stick with <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>? Because like, at least I found <strong>one</strong> active <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> legacy posting updates on Reddit&hellip; actually I found an active <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> legacy on Reddit too, but it&rsquo;s a bit more serious and less &ldquo;this is what happened in my game lol&rdquo;. Are people just making <em>videos</em> of that style of content now, instead of screenshots with commentary, and posting them on YouTube? Because&hellip; I am not going to do that. Haha.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; anyway&hellip; step 1 is to actually play my game, right. Experiment with mods and see if it feels fun enough for me to persist with it. It&rsquo;s sad about the difficulty finding or sharing legacy updates, but it&rsquo;s really just an adjunct to actually playing the game anyway, I suppose.</p>

## Cross-posting in 2024

date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.</p>
<p>I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.  </p>
<p>Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.</p>
<p>I can't send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface. My way of doing it is now called "legacy." The app that uses that feature doesn't work. But I don't even remotely have the time to go back and fix it.</p>
<p>The items in my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a> come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on Masto and Bluesky.</p>
<p>When I want broader distribution, I do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a new browser window.</li>
<li>Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don't know why.</li>
<li>I write some text into the Twitter tab.  </li>
<li>Paste an image if there is one.</li>
<li>I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky. </li>
<li>I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.</li>
<li>I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is too.</p>
<p>One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can't include them in this rotation. </p>
<p>I'd love to see one of these support the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. I would give them 100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn't be long before the others did it, and we'd have a much more complete network writing environment. </p>

I usually write my prompts very carefully, esp when using it to build software, but I just tried not really caring, and asking a question the way I thought of it, so it rambled a lot, was repetetive and had an error I didn't bother to correct, to see what would happen. It didn't even criticize me. It figured out what I was trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am aware that all my fellow programmers taught it how to do this, though I have no idea how it does that, but it is freaking amazing. I keep finding miracles in this tech.

## Random RSS & ActivityPub notes

date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/27/rssClub.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Back when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the XML people were asking developers to do that. "Now you can create your own formats!" The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in the back of my mind, "they don't really mean it." This was based on experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized their products when they were new, but took <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage">umbrage</a> at the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah">chutzpah</a> of the developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important, don't they know that's what BigCo's do. Anyway a few years later, that's exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the future, so they set about to do it as a "standard" and thus was born Atom. My opinion, <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way is better</a> than two, and they should have jumped on the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> bandwagon. But that's not what they do. They're still <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to make RSS unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there's no point in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to do that. It isn't going away. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to create a Busy Developer's Guide to ActivityPub? Here's the prompt. "I want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post. Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js." I asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1">ChatGPT gave</a> what seems to be a reasonable outline for the project. </p>

Start with a simple idea but generalize it too far, so it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can anything pragmatic. It's why I said last week that they <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/28.html#a124521">need a BDG asap</a>, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I would help them design it, I'm a fairly typical "busy developer." I would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not to be revised with breakage to apps. I've also seen this happen before, in fact it happens more often than not. If you don't understand a format, you can't actually support it. This is part of the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5">you can't lie to a compiler</a> axiom. </p>

## How we feel about what we consume

date: 2024-05-05, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

This is interesting and fair, but in her larger point about consuming media by &#8216;stained&#8217; people, I think overlooks our emotional responses to learning bad things about people whose art we liked. (Note: I haven&#8217;t read the book, only this interview.) It&#8217;s possible that we as individuals read too much into what we like, that [&#8230;]

## What I’m telling my graduating students 

date: 2024-05-05, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, My students are graduating at a tremulous time. The largest campus protest movement of the 21st century. The first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. The most restrictive abortion laws in the nation. Two horrific wars. All of this coming after the first pandemic in living memory, one that claimed the lives of a million Americans. And after the first attack on the U.S. Capitol in history, provoked by the first president who refused to accept electoral defeat.

## A quick light-dark() experiment

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I wanted to experiment with the new CSS function <code>light-dark()</code> and get a sense of how to use it in a CSS architecture of nested (web) components. I think it’s going to be a powerful tool in <a href="https://web.dev/articles/new-responsive">the new responsive</a> world of component architecture but I don’t want to recommend something unless I have experience with it in a project first.</p>
<p>My first pass was to add <code>light-dark()</code> to my components…</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* global.css */</span>
<span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--dark</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--light</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But if every component is in charge of it’s own <code>light-dark()</code> handling for <code>border</code>, <code>background</code>, and <code>color</code> on every element… the codebase will get messy managing dark mode in a lot of different places, leading to a lot of inconsistencies over time. A more elegant solution for me would be to handle this job in a single location at the root scope level and leverage the cascade a bit.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The nice thing about using <code>light-dark()</code> at the root token level is your components can be dumber. You provide default light-dark experience and, like good children, your components abide in their parent’s decision. Of course, due to the nature of CSS custom properties, your components aren’t locked into the system and your component level styles can opt out (read: not include) or override the global variables if necessary.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--surface-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--text-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">/* this is a real example from my past */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">theme</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">"lunar-new-year"</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>At this point in the experiment I was pleased with the results… until I deployed it to production. I overestimated the browser support for <code>light-dark()</code> and it didn’t work on my phone running Safari 17.4 (but it’s coming in Safari 17.5). I replicated the issue by changing <code>light-dark()</code> to <code>light-d0rk()</code> to verify and fixed it by adding a tried-and-true CSS <code>@supports</code> query.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>

	<span class="c">/* NOTE: For Safari 17.4 (2024-05) */</span>
  <span class="err">@supports</span> <span class="err">(</span><span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">black</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
	  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
	  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now Safari 17.4 and other browsers that lack support will only have a dark theme and newer browsers will get the <code>light-dark()</code>  enhancement. I also threw a little <code>NOTE:</code> and datestamp in there so future versions of me will know when and <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/you-want-border-color-transparent-not-border-none/">why I built this fence</a>.</p>

## I support the students

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/05/marchOnWashington.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">As a boomer who marched on Washington as a high school student, who started an underground newspaper, and organized student strikes, I support today's students making their political opinions heard. I also see journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn't true then and I'm pretty sure it isn't true now. </p>
<p>And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not what's really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values, only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war, as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel. </p>
<p>We shouldn't have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it's exactly what Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should <i>not</i> be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust. </p>
<p>As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that's why I support the students. They aren't right or wrong, but they are continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the 2020s as it was in the 1970s.</p>

## Vibe Check №32

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>An unseasonable gloomy spring in Austin, TX. The kids are nearly done with school for the year and summer plans are shoring up. My son goes to middle school next year. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>We’ve battled some on-and-off sicknesses these past couple months and with all the holidays every week has felt like a false start. But here we are, barreling into summer. I’ve already been out on the lake to surf on my cousin’s boat, so I’ve got that going for me.</p>
<h2>The Eclipse</h2>
<p>In April my wife’s entire family came out from Arizona to Austin for the eclipse on April 8th. We got a big Vrbo near the lake right in the path of totality. The weather was cloudy and dismal in Austin for the eclipse. But then… ten minutes before full totality, the sky broke open.</p>
<p>I’ve seen partial eclipses before and those were cool. But nothing prepared me for seeing the total eclipse. The complete darkness. The confused birds. The sudden drop in temperature. The fully visible halo effect eminating from the sun. It’s other worldly to see the big space rock that goes around our planet move in front of the big fireball that keeps our planet alive.</p>
<p>Happy to get to celebrate something so cosmic with the family.</p>
<h2>44 and there’s so much more</h2>
<p>I turned 44 at the end of April and had an uneventful birthday. That’s how birthdays go after the big four-oh. I spent most of my day cleaning the house and watching anime. My family treated me to a “fancy dinner” at a place with cloth napkins and the kids behaved themselves through the whole meal.</p>
<p>The highlight of my birthday was exchanging texts with some old friends who have known me for decades. Old friends like that – even though you often live distant parallel busy lives – have the ability to tap into a deep well of friendship. For that I am thankful.</p>
<h2>Making Games</h2>
<p>I haven’t talked about it much, because I don’t want to jinx it, but I’ve been making some games in my spare time. And not one style of game either, a big swath of random ideas in different formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>A “Guess Who?”-style game for Panic’s <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>.</li>
<li>A one-page TTRPG. Almost everything is in place for this.</li>
<li>A 52-card deck game that I’m turning into a game for your mobile computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making games has been a fun and different way to spend my time. I don’t have much to show for all that tinkering right this minute, but soon maybe?</p>
<h2>Waiting for a life-changing email</h2>
<p>You know that feeling when your boss emails you and asks “Hey, you got a minute?” and those minutes until you talk to your boss feels like hours as your amygdala floods your limbic system with intense, wet, hot anxiety? That’s more or less what I’ve been feeling for the last two months as I waited for a life-changing email. There were two emails actually. Then that got stressful. Then I had to wait on a package.</p>
<p>To be totally honest, all that waiting nearly broke me. I’m a decently patient person but a giant cloud LOOMING over me every day that I’m unable to control is distressing. Then your friends and family and kids ask you “Hey did that life-changing email come yet?” and you have to say “Nope, not yet” over and over.</p>
<p>But the email did come. And so did the package. And the giant cloud of concern is slowly dissipating. And on Monday I’ll embark on the next big phase of my adult life. Ominous, I know.</p>
<h2>Stats and consumption</h2>
<p>What you jackals come here for…</p>
<h3>🧠 <strong>Learning</strong></h3>
<p>I took some time to do some deep dives both formally and informally.</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript - Almost certain I’ll be using this sometime in the future, so I took a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</a> course to connect all the pieces I had scattered about in my brain.</li>
<li>LLM Vector Embeddings - All this LLM search jazz is normal vector search but with special GPT-based embeddings instead of Postgres’s default embeddings. Way less threatening or opaque to me now that I understand it.</li>
<li>Solo RPGs - I got a bit obsessed with the idea of playing a TTRPG by yourself and it inspired me to make a game.</li>
</ul>
<h3>💪 Wellness</h3>
<p>I’ve put on a bit of weight and that’s frustrating but I think again it’s stress-related.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking walks</li>
<li>Got a weighted vest for “rucking”</li>
<li>Rode my new bike once</li>
</ul>
<h2>📖 <strong>Reading</strong></h2>
<p>Reading is still on a book-a-week clip. This year I’m mulling around tech and ethics, as well as reading about people who created or harnessed a new technology. I also got back into comics and have read some wonderful pieces. If it’s sci-fi themed and has good art, I’m all-in.</p>
<p><strong>Finished</strong></p>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3UhrHGN">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams</a> by Douglas Adams - I as happy to finally read this classic piece of sci-fi.

<h3>📝 <strong>Blogging</strong></h3>
<p>Slowed down a lot on blogging. That’s okay. I still have three dozen drafts but I’m being pretty choosy about where I toil. It’s easy for me to lose a weekend tinkering on a handful of posts, or piecing together a giant overly complex post like this. I need to stop doing that. Or I need to do that more often. Who knows.</p>
