## Why did ABC cave in to Trump?

date: 2024-12-17, from: Robert Reich's blog

It didn&#8217;t need to. It shouldn&#8217;t have. But there&#8217;s a big reason why it thought it must.

## Getting beyond ProcessExecutionErrors when installing Ubuntu on arm64

date: 2024-12-16, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Getting beyond ProcessExecutionErrors when installing Ubuntu on arm64</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Currently there are precious few SystemReady Arm computers—computers like the <a href="https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-astra-a1-n1/configure">System76 Thelio Astra</a> I was sent recently to test.</p>

<p>The level or 'band' of <a href="https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Arm%20SystemReady%20Band">SystemReady SR</a> used by modern Ampere-based arm64 workstations and servers means you can install any out-of-the-box Linux distributions, as long as they provide an arm64-compatible installer.</p>

<p>Ubuntu has some of the most complete support for arm64, so I went to download a Live CD ISO I could flash to a USB stick, to install on my test Thelio Astra. For server installs (with no GUI), either 4k or 64k page sizes, there are easily-findable ISOs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm">Ubuntu Server for Arm</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However, for desktop, you can only get it via daily build downloads:</p></div>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Interesting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/podcasts/the-daily/ai-hollywood-movies-cgi.html">episode</a> of the Daily podcast about AI in Hollywood. They specifically mention a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_(2024_film)">new movie</a> starring Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, with bodies and faces edited by AI to be various ages other than what they are (mid-late 60s). The movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_(2024_film)">Here</a>, was rated not too great by <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/here-2024/">various critics</a> including the NYT.

## Short-Lived Certificates Coming to Let’s Encrypt

date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Starting <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/11/eoy-letter-2024/">next year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our longstanding offering won&#8217;t fundamentally change next year, but we are going to introduce a new offering that&#8217;s a big shift from anything we&#8217;ve done before&#8212;short-lived certificates. Specifically, certificates with a lifetime of six days. This is a big upgrade for the security of the TLS ecosystem because it minimizes exposure time during a key compromise event.</p>
<p>Because we&#8217;ve done so much to encourage automation over the past decade, most of our subscribers aren&#8217;t going to have to do much in order to switch to shorter lived certificates. We, on the other hand, are going to have to think about the possibility that we will need to issue 20x as many certificates as we do now. It&#8217;s not inconceivable that at some point in our next decade we may need to be prepared to issue 100,000,000 certificates per day...</p></blockquote>

When it comes to topics I am expert in, they tell a mushed up version of extreme points of view, that (surprise!) favor the continued existence of their jobs. The choice of the <i>truth-based</i> label is kind of a clue. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

This post spawned quite a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ldc6fz4sfz2v">thread</a> on Bluesky: "The AI industry could give us easy tools to build our own models, from our own archived writing, for private use. This may be a blind spot. It's as if when personal computers started, instead of spreadsheet editors, we were offered great sets of tabulated recalc'ing data. Fun to watch, maybe useful for researchers, but nothing compared to the utility of playing 'what if' on our own models."
