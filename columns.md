## disabling cert checks: we have not learned much

And by that I mean the global &#8220;we&#8221; as in the world of developers.

date: 2025-02-11, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

As soon as President Donald Trump took office, his administration froze great swaths of government funding, apparently to test the theory popular with Project 2025 authors that the 1974 law forbidding the president from &#8220;impounding&#8221; money Congress had appropriated was unconstitutional.

## What did you expect?  Of course the Trump administration will defy court orders!

date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Ron Garret

I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry over this:Federal judges have issued President Donald Trump
 stinging legal rebukes in the early clashes over his blitz of executive
 orders, and two of his top aides have responded by suggesting that his 
administration defy the courts and move forward with its agenda.There’s no indication that Trump has adopted such a strategy, although a U.S. judge in Rhode

## On Regrets and Their Absence

## It's past time to wake up

date: 2025-02-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>At some point soon we’re going to have to stop business as usual. Remember when we realized Covid was deadly and we’d have to radically change our lives to survive? Most of us did that. We’re going to do that soon re the overthrow of our government and looting of the economy.</p>
<p>It was remarkable watching the SuperBowl last night, you could conclude everything is normal. It’s not. We’re going to have to start shutting down all the services we can to make the point to our fellow citizens that we, the United States, are not coming back from this without major change.</p>

## Musk roots the world economy

date: 2025-02-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First, that's just a theory, but I need to get your attention. </p>
<p>Rooting a computer means you own it. You have superuser powers. You can do anything, install or uninstall anything.</p>
<p>Mostly journalism has been reporting "He has our social security numbers." Sigh. That's not nearly the problem folks.</p>
<p>With root access on the financial computers of the US, you can delete debt. Trump <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud">threatened</a> to do that last night, in a really menacing way. They are smart fellows those guys. </p>
<p>You want to destroy the world economy? Start deleting records of debt to the US treasury. Ask an economist if you don't believe me.</p>
<p>More likely is they want to hold the world economy hostage, and then they will take their demands of Gaza and Canada more seriously. It's clever because it doesn't require soldiers, not one shot will be fired. My guess is that they already have this power. </p>
<p>BTW, here's SQL code that randomly deletes 1 in 5 records in a table named inventory. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>delete from inventory where rand () < 0.2;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Run that command on the debt of the United States, and voila, the greatest depression ever.</p>
<p>You don't have to be a math wiz to come up with that, btw. You can <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa0be8-91f0-8012-987f-89d8b8edba21">ask ChatGPT</a>. And before you blame ChatGPT this would be an early exercise in a textbook on SQL programming.</p>
<p>Deleting the debt would be like trying to withdraw money from your account at a bank and them saying they have no record of you having an account. The US treasury is basically the root bank of the entire world economy. It's where people store their money.  </p>

## 2025-02-07 I bought some tea

date: 2025-02-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-07-i-bought-some-tea">2025-02-07 I bought some tea</h1>

<p>I buy tea about once a year. I also buy a lot of coffee but I have never compared the two. Probably a mistake. At one point I weighed the coffee beans for my Mokka pot and got 17g. I make two of these per day. That’s about 12.5kg per year and probably costs CHF 250.- per year, plus coffee in coffee houses and restaurants.</p>

<p>Anyway, taking pictures of the labels with my phone, relying on the optical character recognition so I can copy and paste this into <a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de">@babelcarp</a>’s <a href="http://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/">Babel Carp</a>, “a Chinese Tea Lexicon”, and reading the entriss is how I also spend extra time with the tea.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ye Lai Xiang (50g / CHF 41.50), <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E5%87%A4%E5%87%B0%E5%8D%95%E4%B8%9B&amp;define=1">凤凰单丛</a>, Phoenix Single Bush, descended from Shuixian trees growing in Fenghuanshan, i.e., the Phoenix Mountains in Chao An, called 夜来香 or Nocturnal Fragrance, maybe due to roasting over lychee wood (although last time I bought it wasn’t nearly as strong as I remembered I still want back that lychee fragrance)</li>
<li>Ya Shi Xiang Dong Pian (50g / CHF 55.00), another 凤凰单丛, this one being <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%B8%AD%E5%B1%8E%E9%A6%99%E5%86%AC%E7%89%87&amp;define=1">鸭屎香冬片</a> or “Smells Like Duck Shit” – this is confusing! – from Taiwan</li>
<li>Gang Kou Cha Meer Oolong (100g / CHF 55.00), <a href="http://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%B8%AF%E5%8F%A3%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">港口茶</a>, harbour tea from Pingtung in Taiwan</li>
<li>Jinggu 2016 ( 357g / CHF 180.00), <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%99%AE%E6%B4%B1%E7%94%9F%E9%A5%BC%E5%8F%A4%E6%A0%91%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">普洱生饼古树茶</a>, Pu Er Shen Bing Gu Shu Cha, i.e., raw Pu Er from old trees in 景谷, Jinggu; this one is the cheapest I could get, being neither from the east nor west of the Mekong river from from further north; they had cakes from 2015 up to 2024, all at the same price, and I didn’t know which ones to pick so I picked an older one – was this a good choice?</li>
<li>Jin Jiang Hui Ming (50g / CHF 40.00), <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%87%91%E5%A5%96%E6%83%A0%E6%98%8E&amp;define=1">金奖惠明</a>, green tea  grown by the She Zu; it got a gold medal in 1915! 😄 Huiming is the name of a local temple</li>
<li>Tama Ryokucha Hinpyoukai (50g / CHF 35.00),</li>
<li>Gen Mai Bancha (125g / CHF 17.50)</li>
<li>Hojicha (70g / CHF 13.50)</li>
<li>Shincha Yame (100g / CHF 40.00)</li>
<li>Sencha Hoshino (50g / CHF 42.50)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some everyday tea like Genmaicha and Hojicha; some Sencha; some green tea from China, and a Pu Er cake. I am an absolutely clueless buyer of tea and essentially I just know that my price range goes up to around CHF 60.-/50g.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in my hubris I wrote <a href="2024-10-22-chinese-tea">preparing Chinese tea for beginners</a>. In a way, I feel like you can’t do this journey all in one go, so I wrote what I thought was important to me when I got started and I’m hoping to read more from people further along.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have books or articles to recommend.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Tea">#Tea</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-02-10</strong>. The Tama Ryokucha Hinpyoukai is intense! 😍</p>

## Pairwise Authentication of Humans

date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="https://ksze.github.io/PeerAuth/">easy</a> system for two humans to remotely authenticate to each other, so they can be sure that neither are digital impersonations.</p>
<blockquote><p>To mitigate that risk, I have developed this simple solution where you can setup a unique time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) between any pair of persons.</p>
<p>This is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two people, Person A and Person B, sit in front of the same computer and open this page;
<li>They input their respective names (e.g. Alice and Bob) onto the same page, and click &#8220;Generate&#8221;;
<li>The page will generate two TOTP QR codes, one for Alice and one for Bob;

## Risk Aversion

date: 2025-02-09, from: Om Malik blog

This quote pretty much sums up what happens to successful people as they grow older. They lose the ability to risk it all. The more successful they are, the more they want to protect what they have. You go from being a creator to a protector/hoarder. One doesn&#8217;t have to look too far &#8212; those &#8230;

I subscribed to <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired</a> because of their famous coverage of the Musk Coup, so I also added its feed to my blogroll so I could <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/blogrollscreen.png">see what I bought</a>, and was actually not surprised that they've been hit by the same disease all online publishing has, the need to bait the clicks, and of course not very much of it is hard-hitting.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm still fixing bugs in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/08/214503.html">new Bluesky feature</a> I wrote about yesterday. If the URL of an image has search args, I wasn't getting the type correct and Bluesky rejected it. I used a post about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz's</a> statue unveiled in San Francisco <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/">yesterday</a> to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group developing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> in the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a year or two (I don't have the exact date of the meetup) he commited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html">suicide</a>. It was a real shock. Now, many years later -- a statue. And the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa1a8beacf79d90bc26105ba46c32072">random snarky slogan</a> my test script picked out was really <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/aaronScreenshot.png">appropriate</a> to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3lhqslgshmt2c">event</a>. It was a tragedy, because an older more confident Aaron would have made a big contribution. I often think about that.
