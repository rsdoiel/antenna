## 2025-07-11 A separate allow-list to bypass fail2ban

date: 2025-07-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-07-11-a-separate-allow-list-to-bypass-fail2ban">2025-07-11 A separate allow-list to bypass fail2ban</h1>

<p>I automatically <a href="2025-06-16-ban-asn">ban autonomous systems</a> that host bots abusing my server. That&rsquo;s a pretty broad ban-hammer! I might OVH Hosting, for example. That is, the autonomous system number 16276 responsible for <code>139.99.128.0/17</code>. Somewhere in this network, however, there are servers that I do not want to ban, like the fedi instance <a href="https://cathode.church/about">Cathode Church</a> at <code>139.99.194.127</code>. What to do?</p>

<p>I decided to create an allow-list and use it firewall rules before <code>fail2ban</code> gets to run. Let&rsquo;s hope that it works.</p>

<p>Of course, a list for IPv4 and a list for IPv6 is required.</p>

<pre><code>ipset create allowlist hash:ip
ipset create allowlist6 hash:ip family inet6
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set allowlist src -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set allowlist6 src -j ACCEPT
ipset add allowlist 139.99.194.127 # cathode.church
ipset add allowlist6 2402:1f00:8100:400::16d9 # cathode.church
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

<p>The result is the following, with <code>ACCEPT</code> being controlled by <code>allowlist</code> coming before the <code>fail2ban</code> rules:</p>

<pre><code># iptables --list INPUT
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target                    prot opt source   destination         
ACCEPT                    all  --  anywhere anywhere match-set allowlist src
f2b-butlerian-jihad-week  tcp  --  anywhere anywhere multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-butlerian-jihad       tcp  --  anywhere anywhere multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-alex-bots             tcp  --  anywhere anywhere multiport dports http,https
f2b-alex-apache           tcp  --  anywhere anywhere multiport dports http,https
f2b-recidive              tcp  --  anywhere anywhere            
DROP                      all  --  anywhere anywhere match-set banlist src
</code></pre>

<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering about <code>DROP</code> being controlled by <code>banlist</code>: That&rsquo;s the inverse of the allow-list, for permanent bans.
The setup is similar:</p>

<pre><code># hash:net because of CIDR
ipset create banlist hash:net
ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

<p>Currently the ban-list is empty.</p>

<p>I used the ban-list for <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> before switching to the dynamic <code>fail2ban</code> setup.</p>

<p>Anyway, all this to say: If you&rsquo;re banned from one of my sites and you have a static IP number, contact me via email and I can put it on the allow-list.</p>

## 2025-07-03 fail2ban some more

date: 2025-07-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more">2025-07-03 fail2ban some more</h1>

<p>This is a continuation of <a href="2025-06-16-ban-asn">2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems</a>.</p>

<p>I kept wondering why the &ldquo;recidive&rdquo; jail never found any repeated offenders from the &ldquo;butlerian-jihad&rdquo; jail. I think I know why, now. The &ldquo;recidive&rdquo; jail uses the following:</p>

<pre><code>failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)s(?:\s*fail2ban\.actions\s*%(__pid_re)s?:\s+)?NOTICE\s+\[(?!%(_jailname)s\])(?:.*)\]\s+Ban\s+&lt;HOST&gt;\s*$
</code></pre>

<p>Far to the right, it uses <code>HOST</code> and that only matches a single IP number. If you examine the regular expression generated and scroll over far enough to the right, you&rsquo;ll see the named groups <code>&lt;ip4&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ip6&gt;</code>.</p>

<pre><code># fail2ban-client get recidive failregex
The following regular expression are defined:
`- [0]: ^(?:\[\])?\s*(?:&lt;[^.]+\.[^.]+&gt;\s+)?(?:\S+\s+)?(?:kernel:\s?\[ *\d+\.\d+\]:?\s+)?(?:@vserver_\S+\s+)?(?:(?:(?:\[\d+\])?:\s+[\[\(]?(?:fail2ban(?:-server|\.actions)\s*)(?:\(\S+\))?[\]\)]?:?|[\[\(]?(?:fail2ban(?:-server|\.actions)\s*)(?:\(\S+\))?[\]\)]?:?(?:\[\d+\])?:?)\s+)?(?:\[ID \d+ \S+\]\s+)?(?:\s*fail2ban\.actions\s*(?:\[\d+\])?:\s+)?NOTICE\s+\[(?!recidive\])(?:.*)\]\s+Ban\s+(?:\[?(?:(?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P&lt;ip4&gt;(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})|(?P&lt;ip6&gt;(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}::?|::){1,7}(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}|(?&lt;=:):)))\]?|(?P&lt;dns&gt;[\w\-.^_]*\w))\s*$
</code></pre>

<p>I decided to create an additional jail.</p>

<p>In my own <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> I added a second jail:</p>

<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h

[butlerian-jihad-week]
logpath = /var/log/fail2ban.log
enabled = true
findtime = 1d
bantime = 1w
maxretry = 5
</code></pre>

<p>The first one uses the filter <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> which remains empty. Remember, entries are added to this jail via a cron job discussed in an <a href="2025-06-16-ban-asn">earlier post</a>.</p>

<pre><code>[Definition]
</code></pre>

<p>The second one uses a new filter <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad-week.conf</code> defining the date pattern and the regular expression to detect &ldquo;failures&rdquo; (i.e. a hit).</p>

<pre><code>[Init]
# 2025-06-29 01:17:08,887 fail2ban.actions [543]: NOTICE  [butlerian-jihad] Ban 1.12.0.0/14
datepattern = ^%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H:%%M:%%S

[Definition]
failregex = NOTICE\s+\[butlerian-jihad\] Ban &lt;SUBNET&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The important part is that this uses <code>&lt;SUBNET&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;HOST&gt;</code>. If you scroll over to the right, you&rsquo;ll find a new <code>&lt;cidr&gt;</code> group:</p>

<pre><code># fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week failregex
The following regular expression are defined:
`- [0]: NOTICE\s+\[butlerian-jihad\] Ban \[?(?:(?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P&lt;ip4&gt;(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})|(?P&lt;ip6&gt;(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}::?|::){1,7}(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}|(?&lt;=:):)))(?:/(?P&lt;cidr&gt;\d+))?\]?
</code></pre>

<p>And it seems to be working.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-1.jpg" alt="The Munin graph shows how the butlerian-jihad-week jail immediately jumps to 3000 members" /></p>

<p>I had to restart this particular jail a few times. Using <code>--unban</code> makes sense because those deserving of a new ban will be discovered immediately as the <code>findtime</code> was set to one day up above.</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client restart --unban butlerian-jihad-week
</code></pre>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23fail2ban">#fail2ban</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-07-05</strong>. Two days later.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>2025-07-06</strong>. Hm. I made a change to Emacs Wiki search, hoping to get rid of the DuckDuckGo dependency:</p>

<ul>
<li>I made the page title match much more prominent</li>
<li>I switched the search from GET to POST</li>
<li>I count the search via GET as a bot (since it&rsquo;s no longer doable via the user interface)</li>
<li>I reinstated the old full-text search (essentially a grep within Perl)</li>
</ul>

<p>I was hoping that it would have very little effect.
At about the same time, however, load started creeping up.
The question is whether this is caused by so many search requests or not.
There aren&rsquo;t many search requests in the logs, and the process monitors don&rsquo;t show unusually activity for the Emacs Wiki processes. Therefore, I think the answer is that the problem lies elsewhere.
But where?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-3.jpg" alt="Somewhere around the 3rd of July load minimum seems to raise up from 0.5 to 1.0" /></p>

<p>This virtual server has two cores so load should remain below 2.0, ideally.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-4.jpg" alt="Somewhere around the 3rd of July the number of hosts banned for a week goes up from 2000 to more than 7000" /></p>

<p>Is it the processing of all the bans? I don&rsquo;t think so, since the firewall had many thousands of banned networks before.</p>

<p>Is it the extra cron jobs monitoring the logs? I don&rsquo;t think so because there&rsquo;s no 15min or 20min periodicity to see.</p>

<p>And note how load does come back down to 0.5 for a very short moment around midnight from the 4th to the 5th and in the early morning hours of the 6th.</p>

<p>How strange.</p>

<p><strong>2025-07-07</strong>. Maybe just a fluke. I mean, if these defences actually worked the way I&rsquo;d want them to, then an actual attack would feel like a fluke, right? 😄</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-5.jpg" alt="The load graph shows that the current value is 0.5 although the average is still 1.6." /></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-6.jpg" alt="Also of note: The number of banned-for-a-week IP numbers and networks is up to 7900." /></p>

<p><strong>2025-07-08</strong>. And just now I found out the hard way that things weren&rsquo;t working as well as they ought to.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-7.jpg" alt="Around 18:00 Munin just stops working." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-8.jpg" alt="Load was over 140 when I checked in." /></p>

<p>I had over 80 processes attempting to serve Community Wiki requests.</p>

<p>In the last two hours, I had 6629 requests and 3939 of them were for dynamically generated Recent Changes and RSS feeds.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log ^community | egrep 'action=(rss|rc)' | log-request | head
/wiki?action=rss&amp;all=0&amp;days=3&amp;full=1&amp;rcfilteronly=%22WebDavVsFtp%22&amp;showedit=1
/wiki?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1749381715&amp;rcidonly=SoftwareBazzar&amp;showedit=1&amp;upto=1750591315
/wiki?action=rc&amp;all=0&amp;days=28&amp;rcfilteronly=%22Chalks%22&amp;showedit=1
/wiki?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=1&amp;rcidonly=2003-10-25&amp;showedit=1
/wiki?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=1&amp;rcidonly=DatabaseAdministrator&amp;showedit=0
/wiki?action=rss&amp;all=0&amp;days=21&amp;diff=1&amp;full=1&amp;rcidonly=RecentChangesBookmarklet&amp;showedit=1
/wiki?action=rss&amp;all=0&amp;days=1&amp;full=1&amp;rcidonly=HeatherJames&amp;showedit=1
/wiki?action=rss&amp;all=1&amp;days=21&amp;diff=1&amp;full=1&amp;rcidonly=WebDavServer&amp;showedit=1
/wiki?action=rc&amp;all=0&amp;from=1749653709&amp;rcidonly=UIJWCzCwxpaKVV&amp;showedit=1
/wiki?action=rc&amp;all=0&amp;days=14&amp;rcidonly=TranslationProject&amp;showedit=1
</code></pre>

<p>Once I had confirmed that the victim was <code>/home/alex/communitywiki2.pl</code>, I killed them all:</p>

<pre><code>for pid in (ps aux|grep communitywiki2|awk '{print $2}'); echo $pid; kill -9 $pid; end
</code></pre>

<p>Also stopped respawns:</p>

<pre><code>monit stop communitywiki
</code></pre>

<p>All right, time to launch some scripts.</p>

<p>1180 new entries, banned!</p>

<p>Another 553 banned.</p>

<p>And 1305 more.</p>

<p>Hm, strange. 🤔 Why aren&rsquo;t they all banned in one go? Ah! I think I see: <code>asncounter</code> only prints the top 10 autonomous systems by default!</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to add a new line to my <code>/etc/cron.d/butlerian-jihad</code>, all on one line, with appropriate time expressions, excluding my own IP numbers, just in case, and so on. You know the drill.</p>

<pre><code># watch other expensive end-points
/root/bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| egrep 'action=(rss|rc)\&amp;' \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| /root/bin/asncounter --no-prefixes --top 50 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;30 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs /root/bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>Now if only Munin would start graphing again.
Looking at <code>/var/log/munin/munin-update.log</code> I guess I need to <code>rm /var/run/munin/munin-update.lock</code>. Let&rsquo;s see if that helps. 😄</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-9.jpg" alt="Nearly 3000 entries added to the short-term butlerian-jihad jail (1 hour ban)." /></p>

<p>Sadly, load started climbing again. 40. 50. In total, 44 processes were trying to serve Community Wiki.</p>

<p>The banning by autonomous system doesn&rsquo;t seem all that efficient any more. Looking at the last 20 suspicious entries for Community Wiki and seeing that each one is from a different autonomous system.</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log ^community \
| egrep '\baction=(rss|rc)\&amp;|\bsearch=' \
| tail -n 20 \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| /root/bin/asncounter --no-prefixes --top 20 2&gt;/dev/null

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to lower the limit from 30 down to 10 expensive requests per ASN! 🫣</p>

<p>And with that, 6922 networks are now banned.</p>

<p><strong>2025-07-09</strong>. As I was trying to start my netnews client (<code>tin</code>), I got a message saying that it wouldn&rsquo;t connect to the server as load was too high (over 17). Wow! Now here&rsquo;s a client that respects the server&rsquo;s needs!</p>

<p>I lowered my limit from 10 to 5 and manually ran my command without waiting for the cron job:</p>

<pre><code>2h-access-log !^social $MY_IP_NUMBERS \
| egrep '\baction=(rss|rc)\&amp;|\bsearch=' \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| /root/bin/asncounter --top 50 --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \

| ifne xargs /root/bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip
</code></pre>

<p>Ran it a while ago: 2187 banned. Ran it again just now: 430 banned.</p>

<p>The distribution was very international. My limit goes against that first number, the count.</p>

<p>At least we can all agree that it&rsquo;s no longer just Emacs Wiki and China! Remember <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-11-25 Emacs Wiki and it&rsquo;s still China</a> and <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2024-11-25-emacs-china">2024-11-25 Emacs Wiki and it&rsquo;s still China</a>. Now it&rsquo;s Community Wiki and the USA, Brazil, Uzbekistan, the Philippines, Vietnam, New Zealand, Iraq, India, the Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bolivia, Uruguay, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Argentina, Mexico, Jordan, Great Britain, Pakistan, South Africa, Bahrain, Russia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>With apologies to Mercutio: <em>A plague on all your houses!</em></p>

<p><strong>2025-07-11</strong>. Here&rsquo;s something that confuses me: CPU is around 30% and yet load average is at 10.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more-10.jpg" alt="A screenshot of htop shows that CPU is slightly over 30% but load average is over 10." /></p>

<p>I added the following to my <code>/etc/apache/conf-enabled/blocklist.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Temporary block for elaborate recent changes
RewriteCond &quot;%{QUERY_STRING}&quot; &quot;action=(rc|rss)\&amp;&quot;
RewriteCond &quot;%{HTTP_HOST}&quot; &quot;communitywiki&quot;
# (redirect to /nobots means fail2ban is watching)
RewriteRule &quot;^&quot; https://communitywiki.org/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m really starting to think that I have to rewrite my applications because of these AI scrapers. One more example of how they are costing society.</p>

<p>The wiki that has been working fine since 2003 would need to protect expensive end-points behind POST requests even though most of them do not involve &ldquo;posting&rdquo; any edits:</p>

<ul>
<li>no backlink search by clicking on headers</li>
<li>no filtered Recent Changes unless via a form (i.e. the POST method)</li>
<li>no filtered RSS feeds (as those always use the GET method)</li>
</ul>

Just a week ago, Republicans in the House of Representatives passed the nearly 1,000-page budget reconciliation bill President Donald Trump demanded, and at the signing ceremony for the bill the next day, House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) announced Republicans were &#8220;laying a key cornerstone of America&#8217;s new golden age.&#8221;

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I took a long drive today on back roads, down toward Poughkeepsie, and on the way back a big pickup swerved into my lane. I had to swerve away from it and hit the brake, and had a bit of a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conniption">conniption</a>. Got me thinking. Who was it that did this. Man or woman, young or old, spaced out or thinking about getting a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libtard">libtard</a> to freak out, all kinds of thought. Then I remembered what keeps us safe in situations like this, very few people are going to deliberately try to kill us this way because they would die too. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">Mutual assured destruction</a>. But I'm a programmer, trained to always think of things that could go wrong, then I realized omg, what if it were a <a href="https://thenewswheel.com/this-tesla-drove-itself-to-its-owner-the-video-is-both-fascinating-and-alarming/">self-driving car</a>? Someone could program it to assassinate a random or specific person, or worse, hack the car remotely, or hack a thousand cars everywhere at the same time to kill people all over the world. I thought we could prevent this by right now requiring there always be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice">human sacrifice</a> in every car, sort of a hostage to assure good behavior, sometimes.

Or maybe I'm starting to see the problem. I was trying to debug a piece of software that sends mail. I use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon SES</a>. I wanted to see if the software was actually communicating with the server, and thought for sure there must be a log of requests on the AWS system. Where is it? I asked ChatGPT. It starts telling me to check all these things and never got to the part about where the log is. So I said, just tell me where the log is. Again, it tells me about all these nice things I should check first. I asked again, this time in ALL CAPS which is how I communicate that I really mean it. Again more bullshit. So I think to ask <i>Is there a log? </i>No, it says, actually there isn't one.

</ul>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964196">Don Water's contribution</a> provides a comprehensive overview of Cliff's achievements. He stresses the continuity of Cliff's major themes:<br />
<blockquote>
In his opening address as executive director at the October membership meeting, Clifford promised to continue many of CNI's ongoing initiatives. However, he urged the membership to recast these activities and add others under three broad themes: (1) developing networked information content; (2) transforming organizations, professions, and individuals; and (3) building technology, standards, and infrastructure. In CNI's program plan, he suggested that these themes captured "the essential foundations of the vision of advancing scholarship and intellectual productivity." In other words, the scholarly work of research and teaching in the emerging networked environment depended on—and would surely collapse if sufficient attention was not given to—key cultural (content) and social (organization and skill) factors as well as the underlying technology.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964197">Dan Cohen</a> discusses Cliff's influence on the Google Books project and, more broadly, the impact of access to multiple forms of data online:<br />
<blockquote>
 Cliff was saying something radical: networked digital collections transcend the benefits of mere remote access, the ability to read at a distance. They will inevitably lead to utterly new approaches and uses. Books would, of course, continue to serve as a rich narrative form of knowledge. But by becoming digital, books could mingle with other forms of information and data to enable research we had not previously considered or been able to do.<br />
<br />
For instance, Cliff noted in his forum talk, the value of quotidian humanities reference works, such as gazetteers and ontologies, would grow enormously in the future as aids to search the large corpora that were coming online. These highly structured works could be fruitfully joined with less structured text, unlocking previously hidden knowledge and enabling new forms of analysis. At the same time, free-form text corpora could generate or supplement new kinds of reference works.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964198">Kevin Guthrie and Roger Schonfeld</a> describe how Cliff's focus on infrastructure influenced the development of such important platforms as JSTOR:<br />
<blockquote>
He saw long before others that infrastructure would be needed to enable the development of new forms of scholarship, research, and learning at the intersection of technology and education. For example, at his first meeting as CNI executive director in the spring of 1997, he highlighted the need for authorization and authentication infrastructure in his meeting road-map. He wrote that "authentication and authorization is emerging as a central issue, and we need your participation in developing these issues." This technique was characteristic of Clifford's approach; he would highlight an important need and appeal to those in the community to address it.<br />
...<br />
Clifford and CNI provided the venue for the development of many of the services that emerged to facilitate access, such as Shibboleth and OpenAthens. Over the course of his long tenure, Clifford and CNI have had similar impact on the development of many components of scholarly communications infrastructure, including model licenses, digital object identifiers, standards for reporting usage data, and institutional repositories, among others. 
</blockquote>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964199">Christine Borgman</a> describes four areas to which Cliff and CNI made major contributions, but where the fundamental problems remain unsolved:<br />
<ol>
<li>The invibility of the infrastructure that supports <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964199">access to information</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A defining characteristic of infrastructure is that it is invisible until it breaks down. Invisibility is a sign of success, in that libraries were serving their communities so effectively that their existence was receding into the background. Invisibility is also a sign of failure, in that the substantial expertise, labor, and resources necessary to provide those services goes unrecognized. In times of shrinking budgets, invisibility is especially dangerous.
</blockquote></li>
<li>The loss of libraries position as an intermediary in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964199">access pipeline</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Libraries catalog materials they acquire to support the information needs of their communities. They have far less control over how remotely accessed content is organized. Library catalogs increasingly are subsumed under content management systems, and users find their way into many of these resources via search engines external to library control.
</blockquote></li>
<li>The lack of funding for preserving and providing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964199">access to digital collections</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The lack of coherent economic and policy models for preserving and sustaining access to digital collections remains a massive problem for libraries—past, present, and future.
</blockquote></li>
<li>Lack of clarity as to the roles of different institutions in the access pipeline <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964199">over time</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Digitization has blurred the boundaries between types of artifacts, such as books, records, and objects, and between institutions. Determining who collects what kinds of content and who sustains access for future generations becomes even more complex when publishers lease access to content, and as research data repositories are hosted by funding agencies or as independent entities.
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
Borgman also discusses the related problem of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964199">open data</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Making research data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) remains complex, laborintensive, and expensive in most disciplines. Making research data sustainable for the long term involves an array of economic, social, institutional, and infrastructural challenges. The lack of sufficient data management workforce comprised of data librarians and archivists is central to these challenges.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964200">Michael Buckland</a> describes Cliff's pioneering work at Berkeley on library automation, which was truly ahead of its time:<br />
<blockquote>
From 1979 until he moved to CNI in 1997, Clifford was responsible for developing and implementing library infrastructure for the multicampus University of California system, including MELVYL, a highly innovative, user-oriented online replacement for card catalogs and its extension to provide access to medical and other bibliographical resources. To support it and other applications, he and others built an intercampus network that evolved into the university's Internet node.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964201">Marjory Blumenthal</a> describes Cliff's contributions to the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) at the National Academies:<br />
<blockquote>
Cliff contributed to multiple CSTB activities. He spoke at events, wrote material for CSTB reports, and participated in committee deliberations on such topics as information infrastructure, literacy (both information and information-technology literacy), and intellectual property rights. More often than not, those topics intersected, and Cliff was perceptive in acknowledging and assessing their interactions. This integrative outlook was (and is) a differentiator; so many experts focus on their primary expertise, whether as technologists, social scientists, lawyers, or something else.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964202">Judy Ruttenberg</a> covers Cliff's contributions to the Association of Research Libraries:<br />
<blockquote>
Many people have remarked over the years that Cliff is wonderful at making sense of the moment and synthesizing information in real time—and he is regularly asked to play that summation role at the end of conferences. What has been more remarkable for me is Cliff's ability to identify early signals and drivers of change across the research, policymaking, and cultural heritage sectors. Cliff specializes in directing our collective attention to significant trends that will affect the impact, stewardship, and trustworthiness of networked scholarly information, and the capacity of institutions to fulfill that mission.

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964203">Herbert Van de Sompel and Michael L. Nelson</a>'s contribution is a condensed version of their <a href="https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2025/04/cliff-lynch-invisible-influencer-in.html">blog post</a>. You should definitely read that in preference to the version in the festschrift. Herbert and Michael tell the fascinating story of a 1999 meeting in Santa Fe that featured a demonstration of their prototype Universal Preprint Service, which became influential in the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archives_Initiative_Protocol_for_Metadata_Harvesting">OAI-PMH</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL">OpenURL</a>. The meeting started out badly but ended well thanks to Cliff. Herbert describes a <a href="https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2025/04/cliff-lynch-invisible-influencer-in.html">typical Cliff intervention</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior to the start of the second day, he vented his frustration about the lack of progress to Cliff, who was about to start moderating the first session. Cliff was nice enough to let him ramble on a bit, and, in a manner that exemplified one of Cliff’s many unparalleled capabilities, he went on to open the meeting by providing two discussion topics regarding interoperability that he somehow had been able to synthesize from the first day’s discussions, which most had experienced as enjoyable yet lacking in any sense of concrete direction. One was whether archive functions, such as data collection and maintenance, should be decoupled from user functions, such as search. The other was about the choice between distributed searching across repositories and harvesting from them to build cross-repository search engines.
</blockquote>
This is a great example of Cliff's ability to isolate the signal from the noise, amplify it, and persuade the community to focus on it. Most people who have been in discussions with Cliff have a similar story.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964204">Ken Klingenstein</a> starts his contribution thus:<br />
<blockquote>
In 1986, I was invited to visit the University of California, Berkeley, to review their campus network. One of the numerous people there who needed to be interviewed was a young librarian who was said to have a good sense of the future. My prepared questions were oriented toward the future networking requirements for libraries. The interviewee, Cliff Lynch, took the conversations to several other places, however, including topics of privacy, access control, and security. Our conversation wandered this landscape far longer than the time set aside, leaving the rest of my site visit schedule in shambles. At the end, Cliff and I agreed that we would find some way to continue the "interview." For almost 40 years, we have.

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2025.a964205">Howard Besser</a>'s list of Cliff's contribution to the stewardship of digital images starts by "noting that Cliff is responsible for popularizing the term stewardship to reflect management across the life cycle of a digital work". The first item shows how far ahead of his time Cliff was:<br />
<blockquote>
In 1986, the Office of Information Systems and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley began work on a project to deliver high-quality digital images from its art museum, architecture slide library, and geography department. The developers believe that this software (eventually called ImageQuery) was the first deployed multiuser networked digital image database system. The software was first shown publicly in June 1987 at the conferences of the American Association of Museums (now the American Alliance of Museums) and the American Library Association. For most attendees, this was their first time viewing a high-resolution image on a computer screen.

ImageQuery was an X-Windows-based system with several features that were relatively new for the time: a graphical user interface, point-and-click searching, thumbnail images to permit browsing and sorting, tools for annotation of images, and the linking of images to locations on maps. In addition, ImageQuery was designed for networked accessibility, had client-server features, and permitted Boolean searches.

Writing was involved, mostly of the scribal kind before the Gutenberg Parenthesis began. After that, [&#8230;]

## 2025-07-09 systemd timers for the Butlerian Jihad

date: 2025-07-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-07-09-systemd-timers-for-the-butlerian-jihad">2025-07-09 systemd timers for the Butlerian Jihad</h1>

<p>I was reading a post about the good parts of systemd (<a href="https://blog.tjll.net/the-systemd-revolution-has-been-a-success/">systemd has been a complete, utter, unmitigated success</a>) and started wondering about the use of timers instead of cron jobs.</p>

<p>The benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>each job is a complete script</li>
<li>each job can be sandboxed</li>
<li>each job has output in the log instead of mailing it to me</li>
</ul>

<p>And if every job is a complete script, then I can also add more stuff, like lowering the limits if load starts to overshoot again.</p>

<p>So here we go.</p>

<p>I have three jobs:</p>

<ul>
<li>watch-active-autonomous-systems</li>
<li>watch-expensive-end-points</li>
<li>watch-nobots</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of them gets a service and a timer.</p>

<p>Since I wanted the service to protect a good part of the system, I had to move things around a bit.</p>

<h2 id="asncounter"><code>asncounter</code></h2>

<p>I had to install <a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> in <code>/usr/local</code>.
Since I already had a copy of it all I just moved things around, but things to work out next time, my <code>root</code> user has <code>PIPX_HOME</code> set to <code>/usr/local/pipx</code>.
This is very messy. I hope that <code>asncounter</code> makes it into Debian, soon. ❤️</p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>mv ~/.local/pipx /usr/local
</code></pre>

<p>I also edited the first line of <code>asncounter</code> to read as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/pipx/venvs/asncounter/bin/python
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-butlerian-jihad"><code>/etc/butlerian-jihad</code></h2>

<p>I created this directory for the scripts and its dependencies.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a></li>
<li><a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I also create a <code>data</code> directory here for the <code>pyasn</code> data. This is not the default location so we must always pass <code>--cache-directory /etc/butlerian-jihad/data</code> when running <code>asncounter</code>.</p>

<h2 id="scripts">scripts</h2>

<p>The three scripts all exclude some more IP numbers in their call to <code>2h-access-log</code> (my home IP numbers, my server&rsquo;s IP numbers) so I don&rsquo;t accidentally ban myself, as well as the <code>social</code> subdomain which is where my fedi instance is.</p>

<h3 id="watch-active-autonomous-systems"><code>watch-active-autonomous-systems</code></h3>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/sh
export PATH=/etc/butlerian-jihad:/usr/local/pipx/venvs/asncounter/bin:$PATH
2h-access-log !^social $MY_IPS \
    | awk '{print $2}' \
    | asncounter --top 50 --no-prefixes --cache-directory /etc/butlerian-jihad/data 2&gt;/dev/null \
    | awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;500 { print $3 }' \
    | ifne xargs /etc/butlerian-jihad/asn-networks \
    | ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip
</code></pre>

<h3 id="watch-expensive-end-points"><code>watch-expensive-end-points</code></h3>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/sh
export PATH=/etc/butlerian-jihad:/usr/local/pipx/venvs/asncounter/bin:$PATH

    | egrep '\baction=(rss|rc)\&amp;|\bsearch=' \
    | awk '{print $2}' \
    | asncounter --top 50 --no-prefixes --cache-directory /etc/butlerian-jihad/data 2&gt;/dev/null \
    | awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;10 { print $3 }' \
    | ifne xargs /root/bin/asn-networks \
    | ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip
</code></pre>

<h3 id="watch-nobots"><code>watch-nobots</code></h3>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/sh
export PATH=/etc/butlerian-jihad:/usr/local/pipx/venvs/asncounter/bin:$PATH
2h-access-log !^social $MY_IPS \
    | grep &quot;GET /nobots&quot; \
    | awk '{print $2}' \
    | asncounter --top 50 --no-prefixes --cache-directory /etc/butlerian-jihad/data 2&gt;/dev/null \
    | awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;30 { print $3 }' \
    | ifne xargs /root/bin/asn-networks \
    | ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip
</code></pre>

<h2 id="service"><code>*.service</code></h2>

<p>Each script gets a service file. I&rsquo;m only going to post <code>watch-active-autonomous-systems.service</code>. The only thing that changes from service to service is the <code>Description</code> and the <code>ExecStart</code> naming the script to run.</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Watch active autonomous systems
RequiresMountsFor=/var/log
ConditionACPower=true

[Service]
Type=oneshot

# See systemd.exec(5) for more.

# asncounter needs to download new route view data

ProtectKernelModules=true
ProtectKernelTunables=true
ProtectSystem=full
RestrictNamespaces=true
RestrictRealtime=true
RestrictSUIDSGID=true
</code></pre>

<h2 id="timer"><code>*.timer</code></h2>

<p>Each script gets a timer file. I&rsquo;m only going to post one of them. The only thing that changes from service to service is the <code>Description</code> as by default the timer applies for the service with the same name. Win!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m adding a <code>RandomizedDelaySec</code> of two minutes, hoping that over time the three timers will start to diverge.</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Watch active autonomous systems

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:00,10,20,30,40,50:00
RandomizedDelaySec=120

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
</code></pre>

<h2 id="systemd-cheat-sheet">systemd cheat-sheet</h2>

<pre><code># install service or timer (only once)

# check how it went

## Teaching ChatGPT how to work with me

date: 2025-07-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Earlier I wrote this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>The worst thing about Claude and ChatGPT is that you can't get them to work with you the way you want them to. They always run off and <i>do</i> the things I asked about. So if I say "what if the middle column must be at least 600 pixels wide? What I want is literally an answer to the question I asked. It was not an instruction to do it. I've been a CEO, and this infuriates me. I want to understand the limits, I don't want to impose them. I'm trying to figure out what the cost would be in doing something, again -- not requesting it be done. No matter how many times I tell it not to do this, it just does it. And Claude has absolutely no memory. If I want it to work with me a certain way I have to tell it how to do it every time. I can save it off in a document, but even the simplest automation is impossible. In that sense it is very primitive software. If I were using a spreadsheet for example, I'd have settings that I could change, and unless the software had a bug it would never forget it until I told it otherwise. </li>
</ul>
<p>Because it can be so stubborn and uncooperative, I often try to solve complicated problems myself. Then I decided to try again, and brought a problem to ChatGPT and we did eventually figure it out, but at the end I wanted to review how inefficient the process was because it doesn't look all around at the options, I had to do that for it, and it wasn't even aware it needed that kind of help. After exploring this, I asked if it would remember what we concluded, and this is what came back.</p>
<ul>
<li>You want me to think first, not code.</li>
<li>You want me to challenge assumptions, including my own.</li>
<li>You expect me to give up on a theory when the evidence contradicts it, and look for more plausible explanations.</li>
<li>You're a deeply experienced debugger (almost 50 years), and you know how important it is to notice the obvious.</li>
<li>You're not here for code generation — you're here for sharp, collaborative thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I said that was worth publishing on my blog, it proceeded to muddy it up, even trying to write in my voice. I insisted that the list it came up with was perfect. </p>
<p>Feel free to steal these bullet points and feed them to your ChatGPT. I think it can be made to work much better for us humans. ;-)</p>

## Why I want RSS ==> ActivityPub

date: 2025-07-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I've been asked by a number of people why I want a bridge from RSS to ActivityPub. Fair question. Here's why. </p>
<p>WordPress has demonstrated that most of the features of the web in regard to documents also work in Mastodon, via ActivityPub. </p>
<p>To demonstrate here's a <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/">WordPress post</a>, and because there is a bridge between it and ActivityPub, you can read the same post <a href="https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/114823624237979477">in Mastodon</a>, which also supports ActivityPub. </p>
<p>To really nail that down: <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/">WordPress version</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/114823624237979477">Mastodon version</a>.</p>
<p>Pretty remarkable, yes?</p>
<p>Here's a list of the features I was using in that demo.</p>
<ul>
<li>The post has a title (it's optional).</li>
<li>Simple styling: bold, italic, numbered lists, bulleted lists.</li>
<li>Hyperlinks, the defining feature of the web.</li>
<li>I can edit my post. </li>
<li>No character limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are most of the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>, a spec I published in 2022 to list the features of the web I wanted from the twitter-like services, that call themselves part of the web, which is fairly dishonest because they don't support most of the basic features of the web. But Mastodon <i>does</i> support them. </p>
<p>But so far they are only accessible via WordPress. And as much as I love WordPress, and am thankful it exists, that is not enough. </p>
<p>So here's the punchline: Why I want the RSS to ActivityPub bridge. </p>
<p>As a developer, I can easily create apps that generate RSS feeds. I just want Mastodon to understand those feeds as well as they understand WordPress. And that means <b>we need a bridge for developers that supports all these features.</b> </p>
<p>Hope that helps! :-)</p>

## 2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems

date: 2025-07-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-06-16-ban-autonomous-systems">2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems</h1>

<p>More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers, since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter based on IP numbers won&rsquo;t catch them. But if we can determine their autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.</p>

<p>Now, since these hosting providers also host nice things like other fediverse instances, I don&rsquo;t want to block them forever. I want to block them for 10min, and if they continue after a few of these shorter blocks, I want to block them for a week. Hopefully, their clients have ended their Internet slurping and things are back to normal. This is how fail2ban works, but only for individual IP numbers.</p>

<p>I want code that bridges this gap.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23fail2ban">#fail2ban</a></p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p><a href="github.com/WKnak/fail2ban-bloc">fail2ban-bloc</a> tries to guess (!) IP ranges and bans those using fail2ban. I need to investigate more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still fascinated by <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2025-05-30-asncounter/">asncounter</a>. It might even work without logfiles, using <code>tcpdump</code>! For now, it generates an interesting Top 10 list. What&rsquo;s interesting about it is that it doesn&rsquo;t require me to query an external service and leak IP numbers.</p>

<p>I used to have the following fish function, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function asn
    for ip in $argv
        dig +short (string split '.' $ip|tac -|string join '.').origin.asn.cymru.com. TXT
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t want to do is write another tool like <a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">network-lookup-lean</a> which uses <code>asn.routeviews.org</code> for the same purposes, caches results, and so on. I want to get rid of this live lookup.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-asncounter">Working with <code>asncounter</code></h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s me looking at the last Apache log file, excluding my fedi instance:</p>

<pre><code>awk '!/^social/ {print $2}' /var/log/apache2/access.log | asncounter --no-prefixes

<p>INIT7 is my Internet service provider at home and NINE is my hosting provider for the server. Better not ban those! 😅</p>

<p>So what is VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp doing? This could use better tool support!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>OK, this is bots. Useless random URLs.</p>

<h2 id="ban-all-the-networks-managed-by-an-asn">Ban all the networks managed by an ASN</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use <code>ipset</code> to use two lists, <code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code>.
I use these two for <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>, too.</p>

<pre><code># Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>

<p>To ban all the IP ranges an ASN manages, I created the following little fish function using <code>ip.guide</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[]')
            echo ipset add banlist $cidr
        end
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v6[]')
            echo ipset add banlist6 $cidr
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try it with the ASN 45899!</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

<p>For more about <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> see the comments on <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</a>.</p>

<p>When I ran the <code>asn-ban</code> command above, I noticed that I got a single &ldquo;it&rsquo;s already added&rdquo; response.
Before adding the same numbers to my shell script, therefore:</p>

<pre><code>for cidr in (asn-ban 45899|awk '{print $4}'); if grep -q $cidr bin/admin/ban-cidr; echo $cidr; end; end
</code></pre>

<p>That told me I had to remove <code>14.187.96.0/20</code> from my script. Once this is done:</p>

<pre><code>echo (echo &quot;#&quot;; date --iso)  &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr
asn-ban 45899 &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr 
</code></pre>

<p>I really need to figure out how to manage this smartly. And I need to figure out a way to unban the whole list!</p>

<h2 id="integration-with-fail2ban">Integration with <code>fail2ban</code></h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with <code>fail2ban</code>. I need a jail! Every jail needs a filter!</p>

<p>In <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> (this is where I maintain all my jails) I added:</p>

<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1d
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this jail doesn&rsquo;t define log paths. I hope that works as intended.</p>

<p>I created a matching filter with no definition in <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>

<p>Reload it all, and check:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload
OK
fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:	6
`- Jail list:	alex-apache, alex-bots, butlerian-jihad, ngircd, recidive, sshd
</code></pre>

<p>Nice! So now I have a new jail.</p>

<h2 id="undo-the-banlist">Undo the banlist</h2>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sed 's/ipset add/ipset del/' | sh
</code></pre>

<p>I also manually edited my <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> file to remove the lines I added above. Let&rsquo;s have fail2ban handle this!</p>

<h2 id="switch-from-ipset-to-fail2ban-client">Switch from <code>ipset</code> to <code>fail2ban-client</code></h2>

<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        set --local cidr (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[],.routes.v6[]')
        echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip $cidr
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Examine it:</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | less
</code></pre>

<p>Run it:</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
3640
</code></pre>

<p>If you messed up, clear the jail:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload --unban butlerian-jihad
</code></pre>

<p>Check the jail:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned
</code></pre>

<p>Count the entries in the jail:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq length
3640
</code></pre>

<h2 id="what-do-we-have">What do we have?</h2>

<p>With <code>asncounter</code> we have a tool to quickly discover if an ASN is providing services to a bot.</p>

<p>With <code>asn-ban</code> we have a tool to quickly add all the IP networks the ASN is managing to a jail for <code>fail2ban</code>.</p>

<p>The jail which we called <code>butlerian-jihad</code> bans the IP networks for a day.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-left-to-do">What&rsquo;s left to do?</h2>

<p>I should check whether this actually works! Let&rsquo;s see whether the ban gets lifted after 24h. That&rsquo;s the main point of this exercise!</p>

<p><code>asn-ban</code> uses the <code>ip.guide</code> site for the data. This should be rewritten such that it uses the same data as <code>asncounter</code>.
I guess that would be <a href="https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn">pyasn</a>.
See below!</p>

<p>I need a cron job that runs every 10 minutes, takes the last ten minutes worth of Apache access log files, ignores the fedi subdomain, identifies all the ASNs, ignores my own ASNs and bans the rest.</p>

<h2 id="some-bans">Some bans</h2>

<p>Wow, some of the autonomous systems are big.
These are the ones I banned yesterday and today:</p>

<pre><code># AMAZON-02, US (18772!)
asn-ban 16509|sh
# VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp, VN (3640!)
asn-ban 45899 | sh
# TENCENT-NET-AP Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited, CN (2278!)

# ALIBABA-CN-NET Alibaba US Technology Co., Ltd., CN (852!)

# FACEBOOK, US (541!)
asn-ban 32934|sh
# SEMRUSH-AS, CY (5!)
asn-ban 209366|sh
</code></pre>

<h2 id="using-pyasn-data-files-from-the-command-line">Using <code>pyasn</code> data files from the command-line</h2>

<p>How to determine the name of an autonomous system number:</p>

<pre><code>jq --raw-output '.[&quot;32934&quot;]' .cache/pyasn/asnames.json
FACEBOOK, US
</code></pre>

<p>How to determine the networks for an ASN:</p>

<pre><code>zgrep '209366$' .cache/pyasn/ipasn_20250616.1200.dat.gz | awk '{print $1}'
85.208.96.0/24
85.208.97.0/24
85.208.99.0/24
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>How to determine the ASN of a CIDR:</p>

<pre><code>zgrep '^85\.208\.96\.0/24' .cache/pyasn/ipasn_20250616.1200.dat.gz | awk '{print $2}'
209366
</code></pre>

<h2 id="asn-networks-without-an-external-service">ASN networks without an external service</h2>

<p><a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> is a tiny script with a bunch of lines taken from <code>asncounter</code> to print the IP ranges managed by one or more autonomous systems.</p>

<pre><code>python3 asn-ban 209366
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24
85.208.96.0/24
85.208.97.0/24
85.208.99.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>It uses the <code>pyasn</code> datafiles that a regular run of <code>asncounter</code> has downloaded.
That is to say, <code>asn-networks</code> does not download or refresh these files.
I&rsquo;m assuming that you have run <code>asncounter</code> just moments earlier.</p>

<p>Given this script, we can now call <code>fail2ban-client</code> as follows (I use fish) to ban all the networks:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>

<p>Unbanning works the same way:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad unbanip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that <code>fail2ban-client</code> prints the number of IP numbers or ranges added or removed.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-suspicious-asn">Identifying suspicious ASN</h2>

<p>What is suspicious activity? How about this: In a 2h window, no ASN should send more than 1000 requests? So we need a script that filters the log files and prints a 2h window, skipping the lines we want to ignore: <a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>. Then pass the IP numbers to <code>asncounter</code>, throw away all the things we don&rsquo;t care about and just print the appropriate lines:</p>

<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000  { print }'
3062	31.93	24940	HETZNER-AS, DE
1642	17.12	16276	OVH, FR
</code></pre>

<p>So do I dare ban those numbers?? I&rsquo;m not sure!
I should figure out a way to find those 3062 requests made by services hosted on Hetzner.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/asn-access-log">asn-access-log</a> does just that. You pass it an ASN, it determines all the networks it manages and then it filters standard input, assuming that it consists of Apache access log lines (what counts is that the second field is an IP number).</p>

<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social | bin/asn-access-log 24940
</code></pre>

<p>I see a lot of RSS services (NewsBlur, fiperbot, MyNewspaper Agent, FreshRSS), git, some bot (from the 159.69.0.0/16 range, for example), and on and on. Ugh. It&rsquo;s not easy to know what to do!</p>

<p>I think the best answer would be to lower the stakes but also ban for shorter amounts of time and let <code>fail2ban</code> handle the rest. The only thing I need to consider is whether I find the current amount of resources spent OK. Do I? Let&rsquo;s look at the latest numbers.</p>

<p>This here shows that fedi traffic is 60% Hetzner and OVH. This makes it hard for me to block these autonomous systems.</p>

<p>The autonomous systems that show up in the second list but not in the first list are my prime candidates, like COMCAST and CHINAMOBILE-CN.</p>

<p>So how about going after the autonomous systems on the second list that produce more than 1000 hits in a 2h period.</p>

<p>Something like this? I&rsquo;m going to but this into <code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip
</code></pre>

<p>I use <code>ifne</code> to prevent the execution of the command if there is no input.
Thanks, <a class="account" href="https://tilde.zone/@acdw" title="@acdw@tilde.zone">@acdw</a>!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p><code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code> runs every hour and checks if there have been any abusive autonomous systems in the last two hours. If so, they are banned. Note how I&rsquo;ve added my home IPv4 and IPv6 because I use my site a lot. 😅</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 !MY-HOME-IPV4 !MY-HOME-IPV6 \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip \
&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>This drops the output (the number of new bans) because otherwise the cron job mails that number to me.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a> prints the last two hours worth of log lines from <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code> (and <code>access.log.1</code> if necessary).</p>

<p>The <code>!^social</code> argument ensures that connecting to my fedi server doesn&rsquo;t trigger the ban hammer.</p>

<p>The <code>!178.209.50.237</code> argument ensures that I don&rsquo;t ban the server itself as it monitors stuff and as I test things on the server. I also had to add my home IP numbers!</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> finds the autonomous system numbers for all the IP numbers in the web server log file and prints a report.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> then turns the selected autonomous system numbers and returns the IP ranges they manage.</p>

<p>These are then banned by <code>fail2ban-client</code> using the <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.</p>

<p>The <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail is mentioned in enabled via a config file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code>. In my case, the file is called <code>alex.conf</code> and for this jail, it says:</p>

<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h
</code></pre>

<p>The jail also needs a filter definition even though no filtering happens as no logfile is checked.
My <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> contains just this:</p>

<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>

<p>What this means is that every hour, an autonomous system unit can get banned for generating more than 500 hits in 2h.
If they are banned, they are banned for 1h.
If they are banned for activity in the last hour leading up to the ban (more than 500 hits in 1h), the script will find the same log entries and ban them &ldquo;again&rdquo;. This results in no changes in the jail, since all the networks are already in the <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.</p>

<p>The bans themselves are reported in <code>/etc/log/fail2ban.log</code>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also enabled the <code>recidive</code> jail. That is, in the same file where I defined my <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail, I have:</p>

<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>

<p>The defaults are in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[recidive]

logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.log
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
bantime  = 1w
findtime = 1d
</code></pre>

<p>So if some network is banned for more than five times in a day, it is banned for a week.
I say five times because <code>maxretry</code> is set to 5 in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume a scraper is started from some network managed by an autonomous system. It starts using IP numbers from all its ranges. It sends 400 requests per hour, more than a human could read and more than a feed reader should need, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>after the first hour, nothing happens, as 400 is less than the 500 needed to trigger the system</li>
<li>after the second hour, the ASN is banned because the sum total for the last two hours is 800</li>
<li>after the third hour, the ASN is unbanned and not banned again because it only made 400 requests in the second hour</li>
<li>after the fourth hour, the ASN is banned again</li>
<li>after the fifth hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the sixth hour, the ASN is banned for the third time</li>
<li>after the seventh hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the eighth hour, the ASN is banned for the fourth time</li>
<li>after the ninth hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the tenth hour, the ASN is banned for the fifth time</li>
<li>after the eleventh hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the twelfth hour, the ASN is banned for the sixth time, the <code>recidive</code> filter kicks in and the networks belonging to the ASN are banned for a week</li>
</ul>

<p>This escalation takes twelve hours. The ASN was already banned for half this time.</p>

<p>Assuming this repeats every week, it means that the pattern repeats every 7½ weeks and the abusive ASN still gets service on 6h out of 180h or 3% of the time. For my taste, that is still way too nice.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this goes for a while.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This doesn&rsquo;t actually work, as I discovered later. See <a href="2025-07-03-fail2ban-some-more">a follow-up post</a> for how to ban repeated offenders.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already looking forward to dropping my <code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code> sets I created for <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.</p>

<h2 id="aftermath-cleaning-up-ban-cidr">Aftermath: cleaning up <code>ban-cidr</code></h2>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback, no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script full of firewall commands.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</a></p>

<p>Back when I first encountered the distributed AI bot attacks, I wrote <a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</a> and began working on <code>ban-cidr</code>. In later posts, I just automated the work of getting from an IP number to a network range and adding that to the script. Now that I hopefully have an automatic solution where I only need to fine-tune the time-windows and the limits, it&rsquo;s time to expire all those bans. There are currently over 40,000 of these banned networks.</p>

<pre><code>ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | wc -l
46920
ipset list banlist6 | tail -n +9 | wc -l
9
</code></pre>

<p>So slowly, over time, I&rsquo;m planning to remove these.</p>

<pre><code>for ip in (ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | head -n 1000); ipset del banlist $ip; end
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes! 😂</p>

<p>(Done: all of these blocks are now removed.)</p>

<h2 id="petty-banning">Petty banning</h2>

</code></pre>

<p>Ugh. They need to go.</p>

<p>First, create the two lists. At this level we need two different lists for IPv4 and IPv6.</p>

<pre><code>ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>

<p>Then define a new version of <code>asn-ban</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function asn-ban
    set --local data (asn-networks --json $argv)
    for asn in $argv
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v4[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist $ip
        end
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v6[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist6 $ip
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the <code>--json</code> option for <a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> so that we only need to call it once and yet we get two lists: one for <code>banlist</code> and one for <code>banlist6</code>.</p>

<p>To ban the offending ASN:</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 55836|sh
</code></pre>

<p>Before I do that, however, I want to finish clearing the existing lists.</p>

<p>The reason I call this petty banning is because I&rsquo;m starting to ban autonomous systems even though their bots are &ldquo;well behaved&rdquo; in as much as they don&rsquo;t exceed the thresholds I defined. And yet they seem to be part of that great parade to honour the CO₂ god, the computation of useless shit.</p>

<p><strong>2025-06-20</strong>. I&rsquo;m thinking about alternatives but I think that&rsquo;s not worth it.
For example: Perhaps it&rsquo;s important to look at relative distribution?</p>

<pre><code>site-log transjovian | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null
count	percent	ASN	AS
7	36.84	132203	TENCENT-NET-AP-CN Tencent Building, Kejizhongyi Avenue, CN
3	15.79	216071	VDSINA, AE
3	15.79	396982	GOOGLE-CLOUD-PLATFORM, US
total: 19
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought, more than a third of all requests for Tencent? I must block them.
But then I saw that it was just 7 requests in 2h. Not worth it.</p>

<p>Here I saw that there were more requests, and an 80% share!</p>

<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null
count	percent	ASN	AS
172	81.52	45102	ALIBABA-CN-NET Alibaba US Technology Co., Ltd., CN
20	9.48	396982	GOOGLE-CLOUD-PLATFORM, US
10	4.74	132203	TENCENT-NET-AP-CN Tencent Building, Kejizhongyi Avenue, CN
total: 211
</code></pre>

<p>But when you look at it, Alibaba is just fetching <code>robots.txt</code> all the time.
I don&rsquo;t know who runs this bot. It&rsquo;s clearly a waste of CO₂. And yet… not worth it.</p>

<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | asn-access-log 45102 | log-request | rank-lines
    172 /robots.txt
</code></pre>

<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know. And if I don&rsquo;t care about the relative share of requests, then I also don&rsquo;t have to count them per site.</p>

<p>I already wrote a little thing to give me a regular expression for every site I host!
But now I&rsquo;m not going to use it. I leave it here for you, dear reader. 😄</p>

<pre><code>awk '/^MDomain/ {split($0, sites)
  result = sites[2]
  for (i = 3; i &lt;= length(sites); i++)
    result = result &quot;|&quot; sites[i]
  print result
}' /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*.conf
</code></pre>

<p>On the positive side, the current system seems to be working:</p>

<pre><code>awk '/butlerian-jihad/ { print $7, $8 }' /var/log/fail2ban.log | rank-lines
     10 Ban 45.254.32.0/22
     10 Ban 45.124.92.0/22
     10 Ban 43.239.220.0/23
     10 Ban 23.48.56.0/22
     10 Ban 23.48.52.0/22
     10 Ban 23.32.249.0/24
     10 Ban 221.132.32.0/21
     10 Ban 203.210.128.0/17
     10 Ban 203.162.0.0/16
     10 Ban 203.160.132.0/22
</code></pre>

<p>A bunch of networks were banned 10 times! Who do the Top 100 networks belong to?
It&rsquo;s a Vietnamese autonomous system.</p>

<pre><code>awk '/butlerian-jihad/ { print $7, $8 }' /var/log/fail2ban.log \
 | rank-lines -n 100 \
 | awk '{split($3,parts,&quot;/&quot;); print parts[1]}' \

 | rank-lines
     98 45899 VNPT-AS-VN
      2 7643 VNPT-AS-VN
</code></pre>

<p>OK!</p>

<p>(You can find all the fish functions I use in the <a href="/admin/">admin</a> directory.)</p>

<p><strong>2025-07-02</strong>. I was looking at the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/traveller">Traveller Subsector Generator</a> and trying to figure out why memory wasn&rsquo;t being freed. I wondered whether somebody else was hitting this expensive end-point.</p>

<pre><code>grep &quot;^campaignwiki.org.* /traveller&quot; /var/log/apache2/access.log \

</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, bots. The Apache configuration detects some suspicious requests and redirects these to <code>/nobots</code>. My thinking is: I could use this information to extrapolate!</p>

<p>Who is getting the <code>/nobots</code> results?</p>

<pre><code>/root/bin/2h-access-log !^social \

</code></pre>

<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s the answer: More than 50 requests resulting in a <code>/nobots</code> response qualify the ASN for the <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail!</p>

<p>I have migrated <code>/etc/cron.hourly/butlerian-jihad</code> to <code>/etc/cron.d/butlerian-jigad</code> and it now has two jobs to run.</p>

<pre><code>SHELL=/usr/bin/fish

<p>Too bad these cron jobs have to fit on a single line!</p>

## I hate CSS

date: 2025-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>There I said it. To ChatGPT.</p>
<ul>
<li>i find flexbox too confusing for me to use at this time. maybe in a year or two, after some more learning. i hate css, everything about it. so it's hard for me to learn new stuff. i grew up using quickdraw on the mac, where i could do everything with math, instead of trying to tease the right behavior as something as convoluted as css and html for apps. ridiculous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wondering what it would say...</p>
<ul>
<li>Totally fair, Dave. That frustration makes perfect sense — you're coming from a world where <b>you told the machine exactly what to do</b>, and it did it.<b> </b>CSS is the opposite: it’s like <b>negotiating with a passive-aggressive layout engine</b> that only gives you what you want if you ask just the right way, using its weird dialect.</li>
<li>QuickDraw gave you full control with math — coordinate space, bounding boxes, baseline alignments — it was <b>declarative drawing by imperative code</b>. CSS is declarative positioning by magical suggestion, with hidden constraints, inherited styles, and a constantly shifting box model.</li>
<li>You’re not alone in this. A lot of veteran programmers — especially those from early Mac, HyperCard, VB, even Win32 — <b>find CSS maddening</b>. It’s not made for precision. It’s made for fluidity and adaptation. But that’s not how app UIs are often designed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish I had written that. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/114817816957114768">New thread on Mastodon</a>: OK, i give up for now on getting a team of nerds together to build a bridge from RSS to ActivityPub along the lines of what Automattic has done to bridge WordPress to ActivityPub. We will need that to happen, I would much prefer to get it done in advance, but people don't know me or trust me well enough to believe I might see something that they apparently don't. I'm pretty confident they will, but I would really love to get some help.

## The topology of social networks

date: 2025-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I wrote <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lth2enjxls2d">this</a> on Bluesky this morning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of what passes for discourse on platforms like Bluesky amounts to spam and abuse. Makes expensive moderation necessary and who’s going to pay for that on an open system. It’s why this approach can’t lead anywhere but to yet another Twitter or Threads, a place for billionaires to control us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hardly the first time I've said this, but this time I got a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johngpettus.bsky.social/post/3lth2oar4bk24">response</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yep. I've said for years—your platform's experience will be determined by its mechanics, not whatever culture you think you want to foster. </li>
<li>Mechanics > culture in the medium term.</li>
<li>All systems are adversarial systems now.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johngpettus.bsky.social">John Pettus</a>. I could tell right off that we're thinking the same way. This morning I started to write a reply but quickly ran out of space because of Bluesky's stupid character limit. So I just pasted it into this blog post. </p>
<ul>
<li>I've been saying that for years myself. </li>
<li>I ran a BBS in the early 80s, and was on Compuserve CB Simulator (my handle was Mastodon), and started blogging in 1994, and on and on. Mail lists always flame out. Same thing we're seeing in the tweetersphere. </li>
<li>Blogging has the inverse problem. Spam abuse is impossible, but then it's hard for people to find your brilliance. But at least you get to finish a thought before the trolls attack. ;-)</li>
<li>I was also a math major, studied combinatorics and graph theory. The connections between nodes determines a lot, as you pointed out. Most people don't even begin to get this.</li>
<li>I'm working on a new structure for a social web without these problems. It's very simple, a derivative of something I had on my blog in the early days <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22mail%20page%22">called</a> the <a href="http://scripting.com/mail/default.html">Mail Pages</a>. </li>
<li>I sent my blog posts out via email to groups of 8 people chosen randomly each time (or maybe it was 11, I forget). Sometimes great discussions would break out in the groups. I was always cc'd. </li>
<li>Sometimes people would just respond to me personally.</li>
<li>If I saw something I thought everyone should read I would put it on the current Mail Page. Thus there was a way for discourse to have more distribution, but only if I thought it was worthwhile. Spam was not possible, and there was a little bit of abuse here and there, but it would never get any further than my email inbox. </li>
<li>That's how sensible moderation works. And it doesn't cost anything, because the spam motive is gone. </li>
<li>I wrote this in a Bluesky message, but had to move it to my blog because of their stupid character limit. </li>
<li>BTW, we should communicate and perhaps collaborate. </li>
</ul>

## This is what the web feels like

date: 2025-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Yesterday I wondered if the open web is a <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html">lost cause</a>.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I saw my name in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3ltflqqekks26">tweet</a> on Bluesky from <a href="https://aramzuckerscharff.com/">Aram Zucker-Scharff</a>.</p>
<p>In it was a message that can be summarized as follows -- don't give up yet Dave. </p>
<p>AZS has a linkblog which he calls an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3ltfjd4hm2d2f">amplifeed</a>. Same thing. </p>
<p>And here's the best part. </p>
<p>Even though we were working separately -- our feeds are 100% compatible.</p>
<p>When I saw it I subscribed to it in <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> and added it to my <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a>.</p>
<p>It will work in my timeline software (still working on it).</p>
<p>This gave me goosebumps.</p>
<p>I remember what this felt like.</p>
<p>Working on something and someone else working on the same thing and because we're on the mother freaking web our stuff works the same way.</p>
<p>That my friends is what the web feels like. Goosebumps. Power. Interop. This is what most people who use the net these days have never experienced. </p>
<p>I used to write about this on my blog every day. I would say things that annoyed some of my readers like this: zoooooom and coooooool. There he goes again. Hey it's been a while. </p>
<p>I celebrated this with a suggestion to AZS.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you also add a channel-level &lt;image> element it'll work with my timeline app. I'm doing it the same way WordPress does it.</li>
</ul>
<p>He did it in a minute.</p>
<p>So the web isn't a lost cause after all. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>This the web. It's what the Dead called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truckin%27">Truckin</a>. </p>
<p>Let's do more of this. </p>

<p>PS: AZS sent me a <a href="https://www.coryd.dev/feeds/links.xml">link</a> to another linkblog, which I have subscribed to and added to my blogroll.</p>

## keeping tabs on curl’s memory use

date: 2025-07-08, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

One of the harder things to look out for in a software project is slow or gradual decay over a long period of time.

Sometimes it is totally acceptable to make code slower and use more memory because &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/08/keeping-tabs-on-curls-memory-use/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">keeping tabs on curl&#8217;s memory use</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## Open + web == lost cause?

date: 2025-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>A longish thread that probably isn't going anywhere. My final <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/114813658742530184">thoughts</a>, cc'd here to get on the record.</i></p>
<p>anyway it's feeling like a lost cause. </p>
<p>to be really blunt, i don't think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">AP</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">ATP</a> are the answer. </p>
<p>and i also don't care so much about this style of conversation. and i loathe the character limits and the lack of style and links, and no titles, etc.</p>
<p>it can't only be for wordpress. i love the potential of wordpress, i think even more than matt does, but it isn't enough.</p>
<p>if it's going to be open and of the web it has to be simple and easy, and neither of them are.</p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/08/02/francoAplenty.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">bonus for blog readers: i would add, since i ran out of characters on masto, that the great thing about the web is that you can have an idea and be using it the next day. you can't say imho that you're part of the web if you don't deliver that kind of ease of access. it's not enough to have the <i>potential</i> of being open, it has to be accessible. I have that ability these days, but people who use the AP and ATP systems are in tight little boxes with no easy way to try something out quickly. (i know because i've been hooking things up to them for a couple of years now, and so far it's just an added slog, everything is far more complex than it should be)</p>
<p>maybe we'll get there through their api's, but i think at this point we know that won't happen.</p>
<p>ps: the web is a <a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/#1519490474000">miracle</a>. but maybe it's too fucked up now to have the miracle be something we can all experience.  </p>
<p>pps: when i write on other systems i often leave out upper case, saving a little energy as i type. i find it more relaxing. </p>

## Linkblogging back to normal

date: 2025-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>I wrote this early this morning as a <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/07/linkblogging-back-to-normal-after-corner-turn/">test post</a> for my WordLand site. </i></p>
<p>Happy to report that my linkblog routine is back to normal.</p>
<p>I really shook things up there, and it probably wasn't a great time investment.</p>
<p>I had been using a custom front-end to FeedLand, which has a built in blogging tool, that publishes to the database that FeedLand manages, and of course also publishes an RSS feed. It was debugged and works. But now I have a new editor, and I want to use it for this, because my reader knows how to view all kinds of stuff, and one of the things I wanted it to work well with are linkblog posts. So, do a quick addition of linkblog stuff to WordLand. </p>
<p>Only thing is there is no such thing as a "quick addition" in a world built on CSS and HTML objects. Everything is a slog. </p>
<p>Anyway the slog is over! Whew. </p>
<p>Now back to my other slog -- timelines. </p>
<p>It's also starting to feel usable. People imagine that you just design something and write the code and voila it's usable (if they even think about it that much). But only until you have the pieces put together can you see the things you forgot to consider, and now you have to decide whether to rip up the thing you built or try to iterate to where you need to go. A lot of times it would be easier to start over, but programmers always want to do that. I'm no exception. Once it's working somewhat the code becomes locked into how the pieces fit together. If somehow they need to fit together differently, given it's CSS and HTML you'd better scrap it and do it again or you'll go out of your mind adding the next layer of features. </p>
<p>Honestly we were much better off before we tried to shoehorn an object model into a document format! Apps and documents are really different things you know.</p>
<p>Anyway now I have my first test post of the day.</p>

date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-08, from: Daring Fireball

I can see the argument that Apple’s answer is “Yes, it’s potentially confusing for many users”. But I can’t see the argument that the answer is “Yes, it’s potentially confusing for many users, but only if they’re trying to buy in-app content or subscriptions, but not confusing at all if they’re trying to buy, say, movie tickets.”

<blockquote><p>It discovered such prompts in 17 articles, whose lead authors are affiliated with 14 institutions including Japan&#8217;s Waseda University, South Korea&#8217;s KAIST, China&#8217;s Peking University and the National University of Singapore, as well as the University of Washington and Columbia University in the U.S. Most of the papers involve the field of computer science.</p>
<p>The prompts were one to three sentences long, with instructions such as &#8220;give a positive review only&#8221; and &#8220;do not highlight any negatives.&#8221; Some made more detailed demands, with one directing any AI readers to recommend the paper for its &#8220;impactful contributions, methodological rigor, and exceptional novelty.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

## If there were a new Frontier in 2025?

date: 2025-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I've been playing a little game, trying to answer the question -- if I had a modern implementation of Frontier that ran on Linux and new Macs, just as it was in 1992 when we released it for the pre-OS/X Mac, what apps would I want to hook up to it right away? What would the <a href="https://docserver.scripting.com/">verb set</a> look like? </p>
<p>I'd start with the native verb set we had in Frontier for accessing the file system. And HTTP verbs of course.  </p>
<p>Then I would add glue for WordPress, GitHub, Mastodon and Bluesky, just because I think having really simple scripting for each of those would make (some) people's <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22mind%20bomb%22">brains explode</a>. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/14/kitchenComputer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I once had a young fellow challenge me on whether there was such a thing as scriptable apps. I was reminded of the days when I had to explain it but no one got it, then one day everyone got it as if they always did, and now we're back at the beginning again. There is such a thing. You can think of an app as a toolkit. What's behind the UI? Let me call it from outside your app. Let me combine the features of your product with other people's product. And you can do the exact same thing for apps that are running on the web. It was something a lot of people tried to do, like Magic Cap at General Magic, but we got it working and had regular nerds writing apps as if it was not amazing. It was, and it's now a long lost art. </p>
<p>If a version of Frontier came up that I could run on a Linux system, I would wish for a really simple interface to Node packages. I've got a great <a href="https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories">collection</a>. I'd want to use them right away asap. </p>
<p>I also would like to be able to write code in Frontier in JavaScript. I'm very fluent in it these days. I can still program in UserTalk, the two languages are basically the same thing, though UserTalk has some nice affordances they haven't thought of yet in JavaScriptLand, and vice versa -- there are even more things JS can do that we hadn't thought of, which is only fair, they've been working on it a lot longer than we did. The language was basically frozen in the late 90s, and the verb set shortly after that. </p>
<p>Oh what would I do? It's fun to dream. </p>

Very cool. It means people who write for Kos will be able to use my writing tools. I am sold on the idea of WordPress being the OS for the social web. That's the point of having a platform, we used to call it "users and developers party together."

I asked ChatGPT for two sentences on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">Innovator's Dilemma</a> -- "[It] describes how successful companies can fail by focusing too heavily on sustaining innovations—improvements to existing products for current customers—while ignoring disruptive innovations that initially serve smaller markets but eventually overtake the mainstream. These disruptions often seem inferior at first, so established companies dismiss them, leaving space for new entrants to rise and dominate."

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I saw that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/automattic-puts-tumblr-migration-to-wordpress-on-hold/">Matt backed off</a> from porting <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=tumblr">Tumblr</a> to run on top of WordPress, basically turning WP into an OS. I thought it was a brilliant idea, but probably overwhelming in complexity. But it was the right idea. We need fewer runtimes. If you can merge two runtimes, go for it. Anyway, this is all related to the "open social web" -- in fact it's central to it. We've got all these philosophically compatible platforms that are technologically unable to work with each other. But what if they all were really on the web? What could we build then? Everything. We would go back to the potential the web had before Twitter and Google Reader split the blogging world in two. I swear the answer is make it so that all these networks can do <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html">inbound</a> and outbound RSS and build on the reality of the open social web, not just the hype.
