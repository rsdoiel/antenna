I still want to use AI to power an RSS feed of news, customized to the interests of one person (me). My query is this: "Create a summary of the news, top 20 stories with an emphasis on these topics: how people are using AI, especially in education, blogging, US politics, science news, the NBA and MLB, with a slight emphasis on the Knicks and Mets. The results should be in JSON format, with each item including: A brief one sentence summary, publication date and a link to a source where the reader can get more info. My software will then create an RSS feed with this information.." The response was basically: "I'm sorry Dave." Groan. Here are <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179036482">the details</a>.

## 2025-08-12 Influential games

date: 2025-08-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-08-12-influential-games">2025-08-12 Influential games</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@Ashigaru" title="@Ashigaru@dice.camp">@Ashigaru</a> mentioned how D&amp;D 3.0 was really important for him at the tjme and <a class="account" href="https://metalhead.club/@dereisenhofer" title="@dereisenhofer@metalhead.club">@dereisenhofer</a> mentioned him playing DSA (Das Schwarze Auge, i.e. The Dark Eye). And I thought about my gaming history.</p>

<p>I moved from The Dark Eye 1st ed that I played as a kid and again as a 15-year old to AD&amp;D 1st ed when I was around 16 because a Canadian exchange student said it was the original and obviously it had to better. Some mere months later my group switched to the new AD&amp;D 2nd ed because obviously new had to be better. And then my interest waned.</p>

<p>Years later, I got into M20 because of the blogs, and my players wanted to play the just released D&amp;D 3.5 because obviously new had to better. With the switch to D&amp;D 4 I put my foot down and went with Labyrinth Lord ‚Äì and lost almost all my players. ü•∫</p>

<p>But I found new ones and kept on playing. So for me, D&amp;D 3.5 stands for those special years just before the OSR blogs took off, when I came back to the game.</p>

## The ‚ÄúIncriminating Video‚Äù Scam

date: 2025-08-12, updated: 2025-08-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A few years ago, scammers invented a new phishing email. They would claim to have hacked your computer, turned your webcam on, and videoed you watching porn or having sex. BuzzFeed has an <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/poojashah1/new-email-scam-house-address-sc">article</a> talking about a &#8220;shockingly realistic&#8221; variant, which includes photos of you and your house&#8212;more specific information.</p>
<p>The article contains &#8220;steps you can take to figure out if it&#8217;s a scam,&#8221; but omits the first and most fundamental piece of advice: If the hacker had incriminating video about you, they would show you a clip. Just a taste, not the worst bits so you had to worry about how bad it could be, but something. If the hacker doesn&#8217;t show you any video, they don&#8217;t have any video. Everything else is window dressing...</p>

date: 2025-08-11, updated: 2025-08-11, from: Daring Fireball

It‚Äôs reasonable‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâespecially for paying customers‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâto expect at least some advance notice of older models going away. But it‚Äôs unreasonable to think that older models are going to remain available in perpetuity‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâespecially in the current LLM climate, where model age is measured in months, or even weeks.

## 2025-08-11 Upgrading Debian Bookworm (12) to Trixie (13)

date: 2025-08-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-08-11-upgrading-debian-bookworm-12-to-trixie-13">2025-08-11 Upgrading Debian Bookworm (12) to Trixie (13)</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Before starting the upgrade, make sure your <code>/boot</code> partition is at least 768 MB in size, and has about 300 MB free. If your system does not have a separate /boot partition, there should be nothing to do. &ndash; <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/release-notes/issues.html#ensure-boot-has-enough-free-space">5.1.5. Ensure /boot has enough free spaceÔÉÅ</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am missing 34M for boot!</p>

<pre><code># df -h | grep boot
/dev/sda2               734M  141M  540M  21% /boot
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m ignoring this for the moment. :(</p>

<p>Deleting files from the last upgrade:</p>

<pre><code>find /etc '(' -name '*.dpkg-*' -o -name '*.ucf-*' -o -name '*.merge-error' ')' -exec rm '{}' ';'
</code></pre>

<p>Purging config files:</p>

<pre><code>apt purge '?narrow(?config-files)'
</code></pre>

<p>Removing old stuff and making space:</p>

<pre><code>apt autoremove
apt clean
</code></pre>

<p>Lots of reading.
Replacing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> with <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Types: deb
URIs: https://deb.debian.org/debian
Suites: trixie trixie-updates
Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg

Types: deb
URIs: https://security.debian.org/debian-security
Suites: trixie-security
Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
</code></pre>

<p>And then:</p>

<pre><code>apt update
apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs
apt full-upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m ignoring the warnings about directories the upgrade process was unable to delete:
The ones I did check contained scripts and the like.
I would have felt OK to delete directories with generated files, or files modified by me.
But this? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Conflicts I ran into:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/exim4/conf.d/main/03_exim4-config_tlsoptions
</code></pre>

<p>This file showed up as a conflict but it was nothing I remember doing. Install the maintainer version!</p>

<pre><code>/etc/systemd/journald.conf
</code></pre>

<p>I had added <code>SystemMaxUse=200M</code> and <code>MaxRetentionSec=7d</code> because I didn&rsquo;t want to give the log files that much space. So I redid those changes for the maintainer version.</p>

<pre><code>/etc/pam.d/login
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what this is about. Did I comment <code>session    optional   pam_motd.so motd=/run/motd.dynamic</code>? Perhaps I did. Let&rsquo;s go with the maintainer version and see if that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

<p>To do after the upgrade:</p>

<pre><code>rm /var/log/wtmp* /var/log/lastlog* /var/log/btmp*
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that the sway background image is back.
I had to add a line at the very end of my config file:</p>

<pre><code>#
# Debian
#
# Include all the extra config
include /etc/sway/config.d/*
# Override the background
output * bg &quot;#333333&quot; solid_color
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2025-08-11</strong>. The things that aren&rsquo;t working on the server:</p>

<p>Getting Node.js installed was a pain. It has a separate sources list from NodeSource. ‚òπÔ∏è</p>

<p><em>Solved, hopefully.</em></p>

<p>Services that rely on Monit starting a Mojolicious app via Hypnotoad no longer work.
Monit claims &ldquo;File &lsquo;/home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/hypnotoad&rsquo; does not exist&rdquo;. ‚òπÔ∏è</p>

<p><em>Rewriting the wrappers as systemd services.</em></p>

<p>My local Emacs can no longer connect to the server via Tramp. It just hangs. <code>ssh</code> and <code>mosh</code> still work, the config files are unchanged. ‚òπÔ∏è</p>

## Using GitHub Pages as a URL shortener / redirection service

date: 2025-08-11, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

With the fate of Goo.gl in the balance and many URL shortening/redirection services being either expensive or spammy, I wondered if I could find a free/cheap way of achieving the same. So I got myself a short domain (CLXI.org) and looked at using a GitHub repo with pages to redirect URLs. Turns out, this is [&#8230;]

Or if users get an idea for linking two products, they can do it with scripting. It was a dream we had for the Mac, but it fell apart because Apple wanted to control everything. I find it's better when developers are free to work with each other, without interference from a big company like Apple. That's why "platform without a platform vendor" was the most important thing about the web. That and the utter simplicity of HTTP and HTML. We lost our way in the early-mid 00s when Twitter took over at the center of the blogosphere. Now you couldn't just work with other developers, first you had to work with Twitter and accept its limits. In one swoop we lost all the features listed on the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> page. I am betting everything on the idea that we can build a collaborative environment like the web was before, and that the Mac had the promise of being before that and at the same time create a fantastic <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22">writer's web</a>, far beyond what Twitter and twitter-like systems can do.

End of the Valley Langdale on a beautiful day. Quote of the Day &#8220;For Trump, everything is a shakedown, the way it was for Vito Genovese, who is Trump&#8217;s model of governance. Every crisis, foreign or domestic, is assessed for &#8230; <a href="https://memex.naughtons.org/monday-11-august-2025/41095/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## It hasn't hit us yet

date: 2025-08-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Theory about why we don‚Äôt fight to save the US.</p>
<p>Many of us haven‚Äôt personally felt much impact.</p>
<p>No hyperinflation yet.</p>
<p>The police still respond as they always have, wearing badges, faces uncovered.</p>
<p>The shelves are full at the supermarket.</p>
<p>The electricity is on, as is the internet. Buses and subways are running. The airports are open. </p>
<p>The Obamas and Clintons are still free, living in the US.</p>
<p>We read the news about universities and news orgs giving in. Corruption at the FBI and in Congress and the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>No major hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, tornados so cuts at FEMA not felt yet.</p>
<p>And we‚Äôve been living in a normal way for hundreds of years. We‚Äôve had no time to get used to the new normal. It doesn‚Äôt feel like anything yet.</p>
<p>I fear by the time we feel it it will be far too late, by design.</p>

One more bingeable, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lights_(2023_TV_series)">Blue Lights</a> from BBC on HBO Max. I love police dramas, esp British ones. I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)">Peaky Blinders</a> earlier this year and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(TV_series)">The Fall</a>, another British crime drama, and, amazingly they all take place in Belfast, believe it or not, and don't count the number of times people say "wee" in the darndest places in BBC Belfast crime dramas. Do Brits really say <i>wee</i> all the time? How did I not see that coming.

Luckily it was one of the most perfect days to spend outside. In the meantime, I highly recommend the <a href="https://feedland.org/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.megaphone.fm%2Ffloodlines">Floodlines serial podcast</a> from the Atlantic. It's bingeable in an afternoon, tells an interesting story of Katrina and New Orleans. The interview with <a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/white-house-event/katrina-10-years-later-brownie-youre-doing-a-heck-of-a-job/4548480">Brownie</a> is <i>cringe</i>-worthy not binge-worthy, I skipped over it.

## 2025-08-07 OddŒº hashtags

date: 2025-08-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-08-07-oddŒº-hashtags">2025-08-07 OddŒº hashtags</h1>

<p>I was recently looking at my homepage and wondered about all the hashtags I used and how not all of them had a topic page. The <a href="Odd%CE%BC">OddŒº</a> page, for example, collects all the blogposts tagged <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23OddŒº">#OddŒº</a> (including this one). So I looked at the <a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">hashtags</a> command and figured, &ldquo;this is going to be easy.&rdquo; ü§£</p>

<p>The first problem is that there are a lot of garbage hashtags. There are over 1000 hashtags used on this site! The garbage hashtags are the result of Markdown parsing mistakes that I never fixed. Apparently the list of hashtags includes the following:</p>

<pre><code>#1)
#fennel‚Äù
#fudge](fudge)_and_the_[pdq](../wiki?action=edit;id=pdq_&quot;click_to_edit_this_page&quot;)_rules_used_in_[zorcererofzo.
ffffff;fill-opacity:1&quot;)
###ÔΩ£
</code></pre>

<p>This is not great. üòî</p>

<p>I should fix those, and many more. ü§®</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hashtags are all downcased. So given a hashtag such as <code>#advanced_squad_leader</code> the code would have to infer the page name &ldquo;Advanced Squad Leader&rdquo;. But what about the hashtag <code>#√§lter werden</code>? If at all, that should link to a page called &ldquo;√Ñlter werden&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And so I concluded that this wasn&rsquo;t easy after all. I saved the changes I made on a branch, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be merging that into the main branch.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Wikis">#Wikis</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-08-09</strong>. Well! I think I worked on it and I worked on it, and then I ran it, and kept on fixing the topic pages it created. But I think it worked!</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-10</strong>. Yesterday I cleaned up my site (somewhat) and today I released v1.18 of OddŒº. Yay me!</p>
