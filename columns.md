## Sanding off friction from indie web connection

date: 2025-01-10, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Add friction to the activities you&#8217;d like to change, and remove friction from the things you&#8217;d like to do more of. This is usually applied at a personal level, but we can think of it across communities, too: Where is there friction in our community that blocks people from participating in the ways we&#8217;d like?

## How to weigh evidence

I lean towards trusting studies, but also recognize I&#8217;m not qualified to evaluate their quality. Coming from an environmental background, I also have skepticism around a lack of evidence of harm, which in the environmental field is often merely indicative of a lack of research, period. I don&#8217;t have time to stay up on the [&#8230;]

It's all about WordPress, a product that you won't read much about on this blog, going back through the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:scripting.com+wordpress">archive</a>. I wasn't paying attention until 2023 when I began to see what an amazing product it is, not just for 2004 when it came out, but in 2024. My theory is that it's the basis for an incredible social web platform, much better than Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky and of course Twitter. That's what I'm talking about for 1/2 hour in this podcast. If you give me that much time, I'll change the way you see the world, or at least the way you see me. I think I'm right about this, with another layer on top of the WordPress foundation, it becomes newly relevant, and very timely, in ways that as far as I know, no one has been pushing it. I think for example that Ghost and Substack should be built on top of WordPress. The fact that they aren't gives a clue as to how portable your work is there, and how little choice you get in writing tools. Anyway, please make the time to listen. This is pivotal, and I don't think I'll ever be able to spell it out in writing, it's pure storytelling. Thanks!

## Folk programming

date: 2025-01-09, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Interesting framing in We&#8217;re all (folk) programmers by Spencer Chang: In contrast to fine art created for aesthetic value, folk art emerges from cultural significance and needs. Folklore encompasses emergent practices and traditions, passed down person-to-person within communities, as opposed to “high culture” which is universal and prescriptive, passed down through formal education&#8230; Folk programming [&#8230;]

Just found an exponential memory leak at the database level in Bingeworthy. I have never seen one of these in all my years of programming. A data structure that saves a copy of itself in itself. So every time it saved it became exponentially bigger. Until it made the SQL server crash because the JSON object it was storying was over the limit of JSON objects. Crashed the freaking server. Fixed. Feels good.

## On Los Angeles Wildfires

8:02pm It appears that water dropped on the Sunset Fire has mostly contained it within a perimeter absent of houses. Good that the winds were not too high to allow that work. I also no longer see the Chinook operating on FlightRadar24, which may mean its air tanker work is done. 7:05pm Some meteorological background&#8230; [&#8230;]

As part of the conversion of <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>, I started the database from scratch, but before I did that, I exported <a href="https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/tree/master/data">all the data</a> and put it in a GitHub repo. This included a JSON file of ratings for each user. For example, <a href="https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/blob/master/data/users/davewiner.json">this</a> is my file. Remember we used Twitter identity then, <i>davewiner</i> is my Twitter username, just replace my name with yours to see your file, if you were a Bingeworthy user in the past.

Now that Zuckerberg has thrown us under the bus, again, it's worth remembering their rollout strategy was to get us to overlook their past betrayals of users. They said "We ❤️ Fediverse." That did it. It was at a moment of fear of Twitter, now owned by Musk, and a belief in the story of ActivityPub, that it would create an open social web. Zuck said "we're on board." Now it's expedient to say to another group that he sees things their way, and it just so happens to be the very people most people who were looking to get away from in 2023 when he was loving the Fediverse. Now we're doing the same thing with Bluesky. And <i>it's going to happen again. </i>There will be a moment when you look back on your "hope for the best" approach and realize that it didn't work, and if I'm around I will remind you again. We have to roll up our sleeves and make an <i>open social web</i> that can't be sold out. When you build value for other people, they will use it for their advantage, leaving you with nothing. That's business. There are no companies that are different, not Apple, not anyone. More in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfagl2im4c2m">thread</a> on Bluesky.

I wish the Ecmascript committee had put more effort into real soul-saving enhancements like comments in JSON instead of coming up with contorted ways to do the same old contortions we got used to dealing with ten years ago. And they could have removed features from the language instead of piling on more and more random reinventions. End of editorial, now on with the new Bingeworthy.

## The new Bingeworthy

date: 2025-01-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Last night while watching a basketball game, checking my iPad, and all of a sudden new items started appearing in the <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> for <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">the new Bingeworthy</a>. </p>
<p>I thought oh geez there's some kind of bug, last thing I need now, but quickly realized <i>someone was using it</i> and <i>it was working. </i></p>
<p>There were some final mostly cosmetic things I wanted to deal with first, and I wanted to fix up the <a href="https://this.how/bingeworthy/">docs</a>, such as they are, but I am spread too thin, and had been putting it off. But here was a reminder, I put all that effort to rebuilding it after the TwitterPocalypse. <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a> is the app I missed the most that hadn't been ported off Twitter identity. So I did the deed, flipped the switch and now you can use it too. </p>
<p>Here's what you're getting.</p>
<ul>
<li>I started fresh, with no programs, no users and no ratings. Then I imported the programs that I had rated, and my ratings for them.</li>
<li>The most important features are there, although they don't necessarily look that great. I want to do some more work there. </li>
<li>The predictive stuff, users most like you and recommendations, have not been ported, because there are only two users, and we recommend both of them to you. And all the programs I liked a lot are great, if you haven't watched them, you should, right now, stop everything.</li>
<li>If you have any questions or problems, I've started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/315">thread</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>It uses WordPress for identity. I like this because it's the same identity service I'm using for <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, of course, and this makes it possible to use WordLand to write reviews of shows you like or don't like for <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>. It doesn't mean anyone has to read them. And I have ideas for how to use OpenAI to generate some interesting stuff from collections of reviews. All of this is just in my head, not even started to be implemented. But the idea of compatibility between the two creates some interesting possibilities, and I love those kinds of integrations, a lot like what we were doing in <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> on the Mac in the 90s. </p>
<p>BTW, of course I had ChatGPT do a logo. There's a slight typo, but rather than fix it, I left it there as something for attentive fans to find. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/07/bingeworthyLogoForScriptingNews.png"></center>The all-new logo for Bingeworthy, via ChatGPT of course. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></div></p>

## Storage Roundup

date: 2025-01-07, from: David Rosenthal's blog

It is time for another roundup of topics in storage that have caught my eye recently. Below the fold I discuss the possible ending of the HAMR saga and various developments in archival storage technology.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
<h3>Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording</h3>
Unless you have been tracking storage technology for many years, it is hard to appreciate how long the timescales are. My  go-to example for communicating this is Seagate's development of HAMR.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMEtHjIgtxAHlXzy_DQUhs8BB0KgahIURfneVHh3b49Byhf-rd_j7Qf9_7aSbFmWjIArop5kBHWS95UuOMYFrA9hbiNoEyDGnJNb7MOjLGtqRGFHfe9jb7HfpcbAsMVNGyh_-meN9PY7LEz1C4vIzDQDynC6EhUX3PV8K0wJ55NZwt2Hmk187QRdN5_pyr/s730/DaveAnderson.png" style="clear: right; display: block; float: right; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" data-original-height="497" data-original-width="730" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMEtHjIgtxAHlXzy_DQUhs8BB0KgahIURfneVHh3b49Byhf-rd_j7Qf9_7aSbFmWjIArop5kBHWS95UuOMYFrA9hbiNoEyDGnJNb7MOjLGtqRGFHfe9jb7HfpcbAsMVNGyh_-meN9PY7LEz1C4vIzDQDynC6EhUX3PV8K0wJ55NZwt2Hmk187QRdN5_pyr/s200/DaveAnderson.png" width="200" /></a>
Seagate first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">demonstrated HAMR in 2002</a>. In 2008 they published this graph, predicting HAMR would supplant Perpendicular Magnetic Recording (PMR) starting in 2009.<br />
<br />
I first wrote skeptically about projections of HAMR's deployment <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2012/12/talk-at-fall-2012-cni.html">twelve years ago</a>.
Seagate had just demonstrated <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/03/20/seagate_terabit_areal_density/">HAMR at a terabit per square inch</a> and predicted market entry in 2014.<br />
<br />
I wrote again in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2013/07/dr-pangloss-and-road-maps.html">2013</a>. In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/10/storage-technology-roadmaps.html">2015</a> I wrote more about it. Then in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2016/03/dr-pangloss-loves-technology-roadmaps.html">2016</a> I wrote about it again.<br />

In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/11/whats-happening-to-storage.html">2018</a> I wrote about Chris Mellor's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/11/02/seagate_hamr_roadmap/"><i>Seagate HAMRs out a roadmap for future hard drive recording tech</i></a>::<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate has set a course to deliver a 48TB disk drive in 2023 using its HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) technology, doubling areal density every 30 months, meaning 100TB could be possible by 2025/26. ... Seagate will introduce its <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/21/seagate_to_drop_multiactuator_hamr_in_2020/">first HAMR drives in 2020</a>. ...  a 20TB+ drive will be rolled out in 2020.
</blockquote>
So in a decade the technology had gone from next year to the year after next.  The year after next Jim Slater wrote <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/hamr-dont-hurt-em-laser-assisted-hard-drives-are-coming-in-2020/"><i>HAMR don’t hurt ’em—laser-assisted hard drives are coming in 2020</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate has been trialing 16TB HAMR drives with select customers for more than a year and <a href="https://blog.seagate.com/craftsman-ship/hamr-milestone-seagate-achieves-16tb-capacity-on-internal-hamr-test-units/">claims</a> that the trials have proved that its HAMR drives are "plug and play replacements" for traditional CMR drives, requiring no special care and having no particular poor use cases compared to the drives we're all used to.
</blockquote>
But no, it would be another four years before we saw the first signs of HAMR drives in the market. In December 2024 Matthew Connatser reported that <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/seagate-launches-32tb-exos-m-hard-drive-based-on-hamr-technology-mozaic-3-drives-are-the-worlds-first-generally-available-hamr-hdds"><i>Seagate launches 32TB Exos M hard drive based on HAMR technology – Mozaic 3+ drives are the world’s first generally available HAMR HDDs</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate’s biggest-ever hard drive is finally here, coming with 32TB of capacity courtesy of the company’s new HAMR technology (via <a href="https://www.expreview.com/97328.htm">Expreview</a>).<br />
<br />
It has almost been a year since Seagate said it had finally made <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/seagates-mozaic-3-hamr-platform-targets-30tb-hdds-and-beyond#xenforo-comments-3834163">a hard drive based on heat-assisted magnetic recording</a> (HAMR) technology using its new Mozaic 3+ platform.<br />
...<br />
Exos drives based on Mozaic 3+ were initially released to select customers in small quantities, but now the general release is (nearly) here, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/seagates-hamr-hdds-qualified-by-customers-volume-shipments-imminent">thanks to mass production</a>.
</blockquote>
Note that the drives that are "(nearly) here" are still not available from Amazon, although they are featured on <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/enterprise-drives/exos/exos-m-3-plus/">Seagate's web site</a>.
Kevin Purdy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/after-decades-of-talk-seagate-seems-ready-to-actually-drop-the-hamr-hard-drives/">writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Drives based on Seagate's Mozaic 3+ platform, in standard drive sizes, will soon arrive with wider availability than its initial test batches. The driver maker put in a <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001137789/5a69d4a1-883e-41f3-a6b8-f4cfdea91d09.pdf">financial filing earlier this month</a> (PDF) that it had completed qualification testing with several large-volume customers, including "a leading cloud service provider," akin to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or the like. Volume shipments are <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/seagates-hamr-hdds-qualified-by-customers-volume-shipments-imminent">likely soon to follow</a>.<br />
<br />
There is no price yet, nor promise of delivery, but you can do some wishful thinking on the product page for the Exos M, where 30 and 32TB capacities are offered. That's 3TB per platter, and up to three times the efficiency per terabyte compared to "typical drives," according to Seagate.
</blockquote>
More indications that volume shipments could happen "next year" comes from Chris Mellor's <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2024/12/19/wds-hamr-switch-could-be-closer-than-we-think/"><i>WD’s HAMR switch could be closer than we think</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Intevac has said there is strong interest in its HAMR disk drive platter and head production machinery from a second customer, which could indicate that Western Digital is now involved in HAMR disk developments following Seagate’s move into volume production.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.intevac.com/">Intevac</a> supplies its <a href="https://www.intevac.com/thin-film/hard-disk-drive/200-lean/">200 Lean</a> thin-film processing machines to hard disk drive media manufacturers, such as Seagate, Showa Denko and Western Digital. It claims more than 65 percent of the world’s HDD production relies on its machinery. The Lean 200 is used to manufacture recording media, disk drive platters, for current perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) disks.<br />
<br />
Intevac’s main customer for HAMR-capable 200 Lean machines is Seagate, which first embarked on its HAMR development in the early 2000s. It is only this year that a prominent <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2024/12/04/seagate-hamr-disk-drive-qualification/">cloud service provider</a> has certified Seagate’s Mozaic 3 HAMR drives for general use, more than 20 years after development first started. The lengthy development period has been ascribed to solving difficulties in producing drives with high reliability from high yield manufacturing processes, and Intevac will have been closely involved in ensuring that its 200 Lean machines played their part in this.
</blockquote>
<h3>Archival Media</h3>
Maybe 2025 will be the year I can finally bring my 12-year-long series about HAMR shipment schedules to a close, 23 years after Seagate started work on the technology. Why have I been HAMR-ing on Seagate all these years, and again now? Not to denigrate Seagate's engineering. Getting a HAMR drive into volume production that meets both the incredibly demanding standards for storage media reliability and performance, and the manufacturing yields needed for profit, is an extraordinarily difficult feat. It is not a surprise that it took a couple of decades.<br />
<br />
My criticisms have been aimed at the storage industry's marketing and PR, which hypes developments that are still in the lab as if they are going to solve customers' problems "next year". And at the technology press, which took far too long to start expressing skepticism.  Seagate's marketing eventually lost all credibility, with their predictions about HAMR becoming an industry joke.<br />
<br />
The situation is far worse when it comes to archival media. The canonical article about some development in the lab starts with the famous IDC graph projecting the amount of data that will be generated in the future. It goes on to describe the density some research team achieved by writing say a gigabyte into their favorite medium in the lab. This conveys four false impressions:<br />
<ul>
<li>That there is some possibility they could scale their process up to a meaningful fraction of IDC's projected demand, or even to the microscopic fraction of the projected demand that makes sense to archive. There is no such possibility. Archival media is a much <i>smaller</i> market than regular media.</li>
<li>That the researcher's favorite medium could make it into the market in the timescale of IDC's projections. As we see with HAMR, where research started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">twenty-six years ago</a>, it won't. Research on the silica medium started <a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">fifteen years ago</a>. Research on the DNA medium started <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/777811">thirty-six years ago</a>. Neither is within five years of market entry.</li>
<li>That even if the researcher's favorite medium did make it into the market it would be a product that consumers could use. As <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Kestutis Patiejunas figured out</a> more than a decade ago, the only way to make the economics of archival storage work is to do it at data-center scale and harvest the synergies that come from not needing data-center power, cooling, staffing, etc.</li>
<li>That anyone either cares or even knows what medium their archived data lives on. Only the hyper-scalers do. Consumers believe their data is safe in the cloud. If anyone really cares about archiving they use a service such as Glacier, when they definitely have no idea what medium is being used.</li>
</ul>
Consumers already have an affordable, durable archival medium. As <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/08/2024-optical-media-durability-update.html">I have shown</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Surprisingly, with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost media, and consumer drives, I'm getting good data from CD-Rs more than 20 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 18 years old.
</blockquote>
The market for DVD-R media and drives is gradually dying because they have been supplanted in the non-archival space by streaming, an illustration that <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast08/tech/marshall.pdf">consumers really don't care</a> about archiving their data!<br />
<h3>DNA Storage</h3>
In 2018's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html"><i>DNA's Niche in the Storage Market</i></a> I imagined myself as the product marketing guy for an attempt to build a rack-scale DNA storage system, and concluded:<br />
<blockquote>
Engineers, your challenge is to increase the speed of synthesis by a factor of a quarter of a trillion, while reducing the cost by a factor of fifty trillion, in less than 10 years while spending no more than $24M/yr.
</blockquote>
The only viable market for DNA storage is the data-center, and the two critical parameters are still the write bandwidth and the write cost. As far as I'm aware despite the considerable progress in the last 6 years both parameters are still many orders of magnitude short of what a system would have needed back then to enter the market. Worse, the last six years of data center technology development have increased the need for write bandwidth and reduced the target cost. DNA storage is in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen's_race">Red Queen's Race</a> and it is a long way behind.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, DNA's long-term <i>potential</i> as an archival storage medium justifies continued research. Among recent publications is <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08040-5"><i>Parallel molecular data storage by printing epigenetic bits on DNA</i></a> by Cheng Zhang <i>et al</i>, which avoids the need to synthesize strands of DNA by attaching the bits to prexisting strands.
In principle this can be done in parallel.
As is traditional, they start by asserting:<br />
<blockquote>
The markedly expanding global data-sphere has posed an imminent challenge on large-scale data storage and an urgent need for better storage materials.  Inspired by the way genetic information is preserved in nature, DNA has been recently considered a promising biomaterial for digital data storage owing to its extraordinary storage density and durability.
</blockquote>
The paper attracted comment from, among others, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/25/epibit_dna_storage_research/"><i>The Register</i></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-can-you-write-data-to-dna-without-changing-the-base-sequence/"><i>Ars Technica</i></a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-03312-6"><i>Nature</i></a>. In each case the commentary included some skepticism. Here are Carina Imburgia and Jeff Nivala from the University of Washington team in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-03312-6"><i>Nature</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
However, there are still challenges to overcome.  For example, epigenetic marks such as methyl groups are not copied by the standard PCR techniques used to replicate DNA, necessitating a more complex strategy to preserve epi-bit information when copying DNA data.  The long-term behaviour of the methyl marks (such as their stability) in various conditions is also an open question that requires further study.<br />
<br />
Another challenge is that many applications require random access memory (RAM), which enables subsets of data to be retrieved and read from a database. However, in the epi-bit system, the entire database would need to be sequenced to access any subset of the files, which would be inefficient using nanopore sequencing. Moreover, the overall cost of the new system exceeds that of conventional DNA data storage and of digital storage systems, limiting immediate practical applications;
</blockquote>
You have to read a long way into the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08040-5">paper to find that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
we stored 269,337 bits including the image of a tiger rubbing from the Han dynasty in ancient China and the coloured picture of a panda ...  An automatic liquid handling platform was used to typeset large-scale data at a speed of approximately 40 bits s<sup>−1</sup>
</blockquote>
This is interesting research but the skepticism in the commentaries doesn't exactly convey the difficulty and the time needed to scale from writing less than 40KB in a bit under 2 hours, to the petabyte/month rates (about 2.8TB every 2 hours) Facebook was writing <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2013/02/facebooks-cold-storage.html">a decade ago</a>. This would be a speed-up of nearly 11 orders of magnitude to compete with decade-old technology.
<h3>Diamonds</h3>
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/29/chinese_boffins_find_way_to/"><i>Chinese boffins find way to use diamonds as super-dense and durable storage medium</i></a> by Laura Dobberstein reports that:<br />
<blockquote>
The research, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01573-1i">Nature Photonics</a>, highlights that the breakthrough extends beyond density. It is said to offer significant improvements in write times – as little as 200 femtoseconds – and lives up to the promise that "a diamond is forever" by offering millions of years of allegedly maintenance-free storage. Diamonds are highly stable by nature and the the authors have claimed their medium could protect data for 100 years even if kept at 200°C.<br />
<br />
High-speed readout is demonstrated with a fidelity of over 99 percent, according to the boffins.<br />
<br />
Scientists have been eyeing diamonds as storage devices for a while. Researchers at City College of New York in 2016 <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1600911">claimed</a> to be the first group to demonstrate the viability of using diamond as a platform for superdense memory storage.
</blockquote>
These researchers, like so many others in the field, fail to understand that the key to success in archival storage is reducing total system cost. Long-lived but expensive media like diamonds are thus counter-productive.<br />
<h3>Project Silica</h3>
I wrote about Microsoft's Project Silica last March, in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/microsofts-archival-storage-research.html"><i>Microsoft's Archival Storage Research</i></a>. The more I think about this technology, the more I think it probably has the best chance of impacting the market among all the rival archival storage technologies:<br />
<ul>
<li>The media is very cheap, so the effect of Kryder's Law economics driving media replacement and thus its economic rather than technical lifetime is minimal.</li>
<li>The media is quasi-immortal and survives benign neglect, so opex once written is minimal.</li>
<li>The media is write-once, and the write and read heads are physically separate, so the data cannot be encrypted or erased by malware. The long read latency makes exfiltrating large amounts of data hard.</li>
<li>The robotics are simple and highly redundant. Any of the shuttles can reach any of the platters. They should be much less troublesome than tape library robotics because, unlike tape, a robot failure only renders a small fraction of the library inaccessible and is easily repaired.</li>
<li>All the technologies needed are in the market now, the only breakthroughs needed are economic, not technological.</li>
<li>The team has worked on improving the  write bandwidth which is a critical issue for archival storage at scale. They can currently write hundreds of megabytes a second.</li>
<li>Like <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook's archival storage technologies</a>, Project Silica enjoys the synergies of data center scale without needing full data center environmental and power resources.</li>
<li>Like Facebook's technologies, Project Silica has an in-house customer, Azure's archival storage, with a need for a product like this.</li>
</ul>
The expensive part of the system is the write head, because it uses costly femtosecond lasers. The eventual system's economics will depend upon the progress made in cost-reducing the lasers.

They've had enough time not only to hit all the walls, but to try out different approaches and settle on one. Maybe at times there were competing ways to do things, like the way Bluesky and ActivityPub, and probably Threads, and certainly Facebook and Twitter insist on reinventing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. But when I ask ChatGPT "can you do this in MySQL" it gives me one or two ways to do it, but usually just one. These are things I never would have found in the old Google-search way of finding answers. An example, I wanted to find out if there was a MySQL way to query a value inside a JSON object, and the answer is (of course) yes. And you can create an index on such a value. I didn't even ask for it, ChatGPT volunteered, guessing it would be my next question (it was). Whatever happened in the evolution of SQL it was a lot healthier than what's going on now in the social web, where the creators completely ignored what came before, and each other, and as a result there's a proliferation of different ways to do things we've known how to do for <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html">over 20 years</a>. SQL has been around for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#History">50</a>, so maybe they went through this stage and emerged from it with a better answer. This feels a bit like the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/677bf6d0-b868-8012-af56-7e4449e9182f">Fermi paradox</a> and I'm a time traveler who has managed to witness 50 years of evolution long after the fact, any day of any week I want to thanks to ChatGPT. Also this is why it is so important to keep the archives of the 1990's web preserved. We may need to loop back to this when the people responsible for the social web decide that interop is important as opposed to each of them going it alone.

Gone is the problem of writing a chapter structure before doing any writing. I've always found that to be a real obstacle to getting started.

I'm thinking about how I can set up an experiment for <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> for writing this kind of book. The first test case could be the docs for WordLand.

## 2025-01-06 Asking for change, politely

<h1 id="2025-01-06-asking-for-change-politely">2025-01-06 Asking for change, politely</h1>

<p>It seems to me that when the powerful are terrible people and the weak are trying to articulate their anger, to organize, to get a mass movement going, asking them to politely make their case and letting other people make up their mind is not OK. By telling people not to fight for their rights but to just politely make their point and then shut up one aligns with the powerful, one dismisses the methods of resistance.</p>

<p>To get a feel for absurd this is, I remember a cartoon I once saw where American natives gave the conquistadores a list of complaints; where black Americans gave white Americans a list of civil rights they were asking for; and so on. And in all cases, the oppressor answered, &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; or something to that effect and instituted the necessary changes.</p>

<p>It never works that way.</p>

<p>For the oppressed to organize, they need the right to speak, to organize, to meet, to protest.</p>

<p>For the oppressor to get spurred into action, it needs to hurt.</p>

<p>These days, that means that protests must lead to costs. Otherwise they&rsquo;re ignored. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Therefore, protest disrupts the economy, disrupts the flow of goods, damages property. If it doesn&rsquo;t cost, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt. If it doesn&rsquo;t hurt, it isn&rsquo;t felt.</p>

<p>Also consider all the political theatre that goes on. You can be part of a grass-roots organisation and fight for change. As far as the situation in Switzerland is concerned, the government might even invite you to comment on new draft legislation. But you&rsquo;re not going to get to write the proposals. You&rsquo;re not going to change the system by participating in meetings. At that point, you&rsquo;re part of the long arm of the government reaching into civil society, there to confirm that they have made the right choices, to do your part in the public performance to assure the rest of us that everything is OK, everybody has been heard and all points of view have been accounted for. At that point, it&rsquo;s too late for change.</p>

<p>The opportunity for change is to be a threat to the establishment, to undermine the seats of politicians, to cast doubt on their reliability, to make them unelectable. Then the government starts moving and writes new proposals to be confirmed by the political theatre in front of a changed audience.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://climatejustice.social/@danahilliot" title="@danahilliot@climatejustice.social">@danahilliot</a> has a blog post (in French) called <a href="https://outsiderland.com/danahilliot/public-participation-as-empty-performance-of-democracy/">Public participation as empty performance of democracy</a> discussing Melissa Checker&rsquo;s book, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nyu-press-scholarship-online/book/37574?login=false">The Sustainability Myth: Environmental Gentrification and the Politics of Justice</a>, NYC University Press, 2020, in which she dismantles the procedures of “public debates with citizens”.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@samiamsam" title="@samiamsam@mastodon.social">@samiamsam</a> reminded me that &ldquo;people need to read <a href="https://letterfromjail.com/">Letter from a Birmingham Jail</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. &ndash; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find the actual letter to be more interesting to read than the summary on Wikipedia.</p>

## A day that shall live in infamy, as should Donald J. Trump

The last time a presidential vote was certified, the losing incumbent attempted a coup against the United States. We must never forget his treachery.

They look for prior art and implement it and they don't deprecate. They're still running the APIs we invented for blogging before WordPress even existed. The philosophy is "Let's not argue about decisions made a long time ago, because <i>we want interop." </i>People have all kinds of harsh things to say about their leadership, but unless you're a developer you don't understand that the reason it works is that they have a different code for their code, the only way we get interop is by <a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod">not re-inventing</a>. There are two competing ways to do things in tech. The blogging world has been taken over by the re-inventors, like the Bluesky people. They make a nice product, but honestly they don't reallllly want us to work with them, or we wouldn't be having this friction. Their API is bullshit. Plain and simple. They even thought of using RSS constructs and decided to reinvent the whole thing. There are places to innovate, like new freedom for users and developers, or there are ways to create <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html">hamster cages</a> where everyone <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hamster+cage+site%3Ascripting.com">gets</a> to run around in a very tightly defined space, that's fun. That's what Twitter was about, and that's what Bluesky is doing too. At some point we're really going to break free of this mess, but this isn't that time, yet.

Makes our apps more expensive to maintain, and we waste time and human wear and tear on stupid bullshit make-work. Developers are people, and our work is already horribly overly complex, we're working at the edge of comprehension, and what the fukc let's throw some more unnecessary complication into the mix. Arrogance, narcissism, whatever the source is, it's not a good way to introduce yourself. And, even better, after you go through the maze they break it, with an error message about <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/1d0b3163a8441a98e6098a29393ac834">legacy blob</a> bullshit. They've already done this, and they're just getting started. It's why I say they should just adapt to RSS instead of trying to force us to adapt to them. I'll do it one more time, and then that's it. They can fix my code next time they break it.

## S3 bucket configuration for Wagtail

date: 2025-01-05, updated: 2025-01-05, from: Cynthia Kiser's blog

We host our websites in Docker containers using Fargate on AWS. This means we don’t have a permanent file system so we need to use S3 to store the media files our users upload. Fortunately there is a Django package to add a variety of different file storage options, including S3. Setting up S3 via django-storages is pretty straightforward - install the package, configure storages.backends.s3.S3Storage as the storage backend, and include AWS access information in your environment variables.
