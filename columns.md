**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

And for some companies, the founder of a company they acquire might make the best CEO when the founder of the original company isn't available. Again Apple is a great example. Steve Jobs ultimately replaced Gil Amelio, after Apple bought NeXT.

## Cushy Kitty

date: 2024-09-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Wordle Kitty is watching TV along with 80 other convicted house pets serving life sentences at Attica high security prison. They‚Äôre watching a mushy political psycho drama starring Wordle Kitty herself, the cutest most adorable kitten known to mankind. The NYT headline reads ‚ÄúCushy kitty crushes mushy melodrama in prison laugh riot.‚Äù</p>

Graham uses Steve Jobs as an example. He knew what was and wasn't an Apple product. A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him. Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience, had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he himself wanted it, and that's what made something an Apple product. It's probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the products Jobs created for them. He told <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook">Cook</a> to innovate on his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody would be able to do it. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

Another rule for whoever runs a tech company, they must themselves be a fanatical user of the company's product. They must love it the way a founder loves it. They must think the users are the smartest people in the world because they love the best product in the world. As a founder, I could not visualize the day I left the company for the last time. In hindsight I felt that was the one factor most responsible for the success of the company.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/01/paulMcCartney.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Paul Graham wrote a very <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html">useful piece</a> about "Founder Mode." As a founder myself, I think I can tell you why founders have a central role to play as the company grows. They're the only ones who know how the company was built, and what works and what doesn't and how to keep it consistent for customers and partners, and the founder, if the company grew, is tuned into to what makes the company work, and will see opportunities that even well-intentioned managers miss. I remember when a company I was a developer for, early in my career, switched out the founder and replaced him with a professional CEO. The founder had problems managing, and could have used help imho, but -- the founder understood what the company was about, and the professional claimed to be a "market of one" and therefore didn't have an opinion about what products the company should make. That would be delegated to people he hired. Almost as if the people running a company were just modules and servers, and if you needed to grow you just bought new modules. In this case. I can write this because I don't have to get approval from anyone else. I'm sure in a company of today someone would take offense at something I wrote here. That my friends is another reason why companies have a hard time scaling. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

## Platform drivers for textcasting

date: 2024-08-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A feature I've wanted to add to the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main">textcasting server app</a> is a plug-in architecture so you can add a new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md#platform-drivers">platform driver</a> without having to reconfigure or even reboot the server. </p>
<p>There's a new folder at <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main/plugins/platforms">plugins/platforms</a>. Each subfolder contains a driver for one platform. Initially there are four folder:  bluesky, mastodon, twitter and wordpress. Each driver is a Node module that exports a single function that posts an item to the platform. </p>
<p>As an example here's the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/plugins/platforms/wordpress/code.js">driver</a> for WordPress. </p>
<p>The drivers are invoked through an HTTP POST call, where the body contains the parameters to the driver. The parameters for each driver are different, because their APIs are different. To add support for a new platform, you just write a new driver. </p>
<p>I also have a client app that does linkblogging through this server, that's why my linkblogging these days is so relatively effortless. </p>
<p>Even though the current situation is done without standards, I think not only will that change over time, but this is a good thing. What used to be a corporate silo owned by Twitter, Inc is now a competitive market with lots of players. That's what we wanted back in 2006 when Twitter started, and now we have it. </p>
<p>This isn't the last step or the first step toward getting them all to coalesce, but it is progress. </p>
<p>If you're a developer have a look. And if you're a user, know that we're on the road to make cross-site posting a reality. It works for super-geeks like myself now, but eventually it'll work for poets too.</p>
<p>PS: There's also an <a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">RSS feed</a> emanating from my textcasting system, that, in conjunction with the masterful Manton Reece at <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>, is how I do my cross-posting to Threads. Eventually I expect there will be a platform driver for Threads too, but for now -- this is how it works. Thanks Manton! It's great to work with you on this stuff. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-08-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

It has come to my attention that "It's even worse than it appears" might not be the right overlay for Kamala Harris, whose <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2024/08/23/presidentKamala.png">picture</a> is the current <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/30/scriptingNewsBanner.png">banner art</a> for <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/30.html">Scripting News</a>. Of course she's still even better than she appears. I really mean that, and if you read this blog regularly you know. But what would a random person think? Hmm. Maybe that it's strange, this is a picture of the would-be president, and it's a good one. I wonder if there are many levels of irony going on at this moment, the visitor might think. No matter how much I love the Democratic team this year, this is not a campaign site. I don't take ads. This is just a blog. You might have to peer below the surface to figure out what's going on. Even the guy who writes this freaking thing can't see all the angles. For now neither the image or motto are changing. There hasn't always been a motto there you know.

Trump was the only comedian on stage at the debates. And his act was fresh. The people who loved him loved that the other people hated him. It really was simple. Like a sports team or a favorite comic. Anyway, the Harris folk are <i>good</i> at putdowns and comedy, and the time is right. Trump's act is done, people are tired of the same old bullshit (which is exactly what Kamala said last night in the big interview). That's the cushion they're floating on. If they had called Trump weird in 2016 it wouldn't have worked, and probably not in 2020 for different reasons (he wasn't a joke at that moment, a huge number of Americans were sick and dying, and the economy was in ruin and there was no end in sight, not a good time to be joking around). But now Trump <i>is</i> a joke. So it feels right. Another perspective you should get is James Carville, who was on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/james-carville-trump-is-in-deep-trouble-and-he-knows-it/id1728152109?i=1000666762884">Daily Blast podcast</a> on Tuesday. Real eye-openers re how campaigns really work and why it's working for Team Harris now. And btw, why she's doing great now and not so good in 2019, two things. 1. Obviously she's grown. The last four years she's been VP of the United States. That's got to be some kind of education for someone as brilliant as she is. 2. In 2019 she was on stage with 20 other people, and only got tiny slivers of time. Look at what you find appealing about her now (assuming you do). It's the pauses and looks as much as anything, the facial expression. Anyway, she's really good at what she's doing now, at all levels, and Donald Trump is washed up. That's why it still feels good because of course he still could win.

## 2024-08-30 Karoshi and taxes

date: 2024-08-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-30-karoshi-and-taxes">2024-08-30 Karoshi and taxes</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoshi">Karoshi</a> is when you are being worked to death without the use of prison guards. Survive the intense pressure of the workplace, of course! But then speak up about it. Name the organizations that are part of this scheme to squeeze us for all the hours we help them make a profit, name the techniques they use, start resisting in big and small ways, help each other to resist. 99% of us are in this, together.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m watching family members working long hours for the Swiss federal government, and on the weekend, too, and I don&rsquo;t like it. I don&rsquo;t like it one bit.</p>

<p>This is what happens when people want a balanced budget and tax cuts for the rich: there&rsquo;s not enough money to go around, the work still needs to get done, and so those who want to do a good job get to bear the burden. The good start leaving. The experienced start leaving. The longer this continues, the work is done by fewer people, desperate people, inexperienced people, until it all fails, all at the same time.</p>

<p>We need to vote for people and parties that want to increase the tax burden for the rich, that want to solve the problems of tax evasion and of capital flight. We need that money and the rich don&rsquo;t.</p>

## 2024-08-29 msmtp and app armor

date: 2024-08-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-29-msmtp-and-app-armor">2024-08-29 msmtp and app armor</h1>

<p>I tried to send an email from Emacs and it didn&rsquo;t work. The error was:</p>

<pre><code>msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to reproduce the problem with the following <code>hello.txt</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>From: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
To: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
Subject: Test

This is the test.
</code></pre>

<p>And then feeding that to <code>msmtp</code> with debugging enabled (<code>-d</code>) and reading recipients from the mail (<code>-t</code>):</p>

<pre><code>msmtp -d -t &lt; hello.smtp
</code></pre>

<p>Now I had more info, however:</p>

<pre><code>ignoring system configuration file /etc/msmtprc: No such file or directory
ignoring user configuration file /home/alex/.config/msmtp/config: Permission denied
falling back to default account
msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>

<p>I checked permissions, and it was 0600 for the config file.
Online, I found a reference to AppArmor.
Taking a peek at <code>/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp</code> I didn&rsquo;t see anything surprising.
But then I grew suspicious‚Ä¶ I had in fact moved <code>~/.config/msmtp</code> to <code>~/src/home/.config/msmtp</code> (which is a Git repository) and replaced that with a symbolic link. AppArmor didn&rsquo;t like this and decided that <code>msmtp</code> was not allowed to read that other file.
Moving the directory back solved this problem.</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll be making occasional copies of this file into the Git repository. üòí</p>

## 2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu

date: 2024-08-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-18-indie-search-for-oddmu">2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu</h1>

<p>This is a follow-up for <a href="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexes">2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing</a> where I linked to <a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch, byJP</a>. I want to see what&rsquo;s required for this to work.</p>

<p>First, I need to install Pagefind. Lucky me, I already have a Rust build environment installed.</p>

<pre><code>cargo install pagefind
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I need a static HTML copy of my site:</p>

<pre><code>env ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en  oddmu static -jobs 3 /tmp/alex
</code></pre>

<p>Create the index:</p>

<pre><code>pagefind --site /tmp/alex
</code></pre>

<p>Upload:</p>

<pre><code>mv /tmp/alex/pagefind .
make upload
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s now available at <code>https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind</code>.</p>

<p>Adding the info to the page header:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;application/pagefind&quot; href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind&quot; title=&quot;Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Diary&quot;&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) =&gt; {
  new PagefindUI({ element: &quot;#pagefind&quot;, showSubResults: true });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And a div to the page body:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;pagefind&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I had to add <code>'unsafe-eval'</code> to the <code>script-src</code> Content-Security-Policy header.</p>

<p>Too bad the search result links all end in <code>.html</code> ‚Ä¶ that requires an extra rewrite rule, to get rid of. On the other hand, it also allowed me to get rid of <code>baseUrl: &quot;/view/&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Since there are still rough edges, this search is only available via <a href="pagefind.html">Pagefind</a>. I&rsquo;m also not promising any updates to the index.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Odd¬µ">#Odd¬µ</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-19</strong>. While I was experimenting with this all, I asked <a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io">@byjp</a> some questions.</p>

<p><em>Sites provide local indexes in the Pagefind format, as a static file?</em></p>

<p>Correct ‚Äî except it‚Äôs many files, organised so as to allow minimal transfer for a single search query ‚Äî but all can be retrieved to have a full local index</p>

<p><em>Clients register one or more of these files and allow searching them?</em></p>

<p>Correct ‚Äî they can be retrieved/cached to query locally, or queried efficiently remotely.</p>

<p><em>Users can install a large number of them, locally? Like I have 23 local dictionaries installed for my dictd and I can query them, locally.</em></p>

<p>Yes. Many can be kept locally or remotely. The sites you ‚Äúregister‚Äù/add become your search index.</p>

<p><em>Is it possible for a website to offer just a Pagefind installation with a number of URLs to Pagefind indexes without hosting pages and indexes? Clients visiting this Pagefind installation would download all the indexes pointed to in the list and search them locally?</em></p>

<p>Yes (with minor hackery). Each Pagefind instance <em>is</em> the index, a small bootstrapping JS/WASM blob, and ~5 lines of init JS. Those 5 lines can include locations of multiple indexes for the (exclusively client-side) JS to query when searching; by default the only one configured is the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù index that created with the Pagefind JS/WASM blob, but you could strip away an empty index and have what you describe ‚Äî in fact, that‚Äôs what my <a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch</a> demo does!</p>

<p><em>If instead of visiting a site with a Pagefind installation one installs a Pagefind browser extensions, is it possible to point it to a URL that hosts a list of indexes?</em></p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt built that (yet), but yeah ‚Äî I‚Äôd want to build an mf2/IndieWeb compatible ‚Äúnew user experience‚Äù that‚Äôd guide folks to finding a good-for-them set of defaults. My demo automatically (provisionally) adds any site you visit that supports IndieSearch, so you‚Äôd get better coverage fast. I‚Äôd also consider default-importing from blogrolls and the like. (Management &amp; performance gets tricky with 1000s of indexes. Probs an ‚Äúif we get there‚Äù problem. üòÖ)</p>

<p><em>Is it possible to &ldquo;merge&rdquo; Pagefind indexes and pass those aggregates on? I&rsquo;m afraid that having local copies of the indexes means that clients will have to at least query thousands of sites for updates to their page indexes.</em></p>

<p>Not yet, but I asked exactly this question of the Pagefind devs and they offered that it‚Äôs currently too hard, but that there is a potential route they&rsquo;d consider, see <a href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/discussions/564#discussioncomment-8702059">#564</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you so much for answering the questions!</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking about the situation where I&rsquo;m part of a community and we want to all share search, like using <a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a> for a webring ‚Äì except I&rsquo;d like a solution where I don&rsquo;t have to do the crawling.</p>

<p>Sadly, the communities I&rsquo;m part of are planets such as <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> or <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>, each with hundreds of blogs. I suppose most of them don&rsquo;t offer a Pagefind index, being hosted on Blogspot and Wordpress, but what I&rsquo;m considering is ingesting their feed and indexing it. This could be a service I could perform for people. Luckily, it&rsquo;s often possible to get all the blog pages via the feed. This is how I&rsquo;ve made <a href="2010-05-31_Blognapping">local backups of other people&rsquo;s blogs</a>. I guess that each site would be a separate index, however?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to find a way that doesn&rsquo;t require me to always download all the pages. I&rsquo;d like to find a way to update the index as it&rsquo;s being used.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d need a way to figure out how to configure it such that the results link back to the original pages, of course.</p>

<p>Another thing I&rsquo;m considering is that my own site is rendered live, from Markdown files‚Ä¶ it&rsquo;s not a static site. So ideally I&rsquo;d be able to ingest Markdown files directly. Or I can go the route of exporting it all into a big feed and ingesting that, once I&rsquo;ve solved the problem above, I guess. But the problem above might also be easier to solve by extracting HTML pages from the feed. It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done in the past. Create something that works, first, then improve it later?</p>

<p>Anyway, ideas are swirling around.</p>

<p><strong>2024-08-19</strong>. I notice more things that aren&rsquo;t quite working the way I like them to work.</p>

<p>The sort order of the results is less than ideal, for example. I like to emphasize more recent blog posts.
Pagefind, however, returns them in some sort of scoring order so that I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few results with pages around 20 years old.</p>

<p>Image previews seem to rarely work. I suspect the problem is pages in subfolders linking to images in that same subfolder. Such relative links don&rsquo;t need a path ‚Äì but they do if Pagefind is not in the same directory.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing to consider: The index takes up more space than the full HTML of the entire site, compressed!</p>

<pre><code>alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; du -sh alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz 
 43M	alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind
9.7M	alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz
</code></pre>

<p>So the Pagefind index takes about 4√ó more space than the full HTML, for this site. This matches my experience with better indexing for my own site where I experimented with full text indexes and trigram indexes. Back then:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the 15 MiB of markdown files seem to have generated an index of 70 MiB ‚Äì <a href="2023-09-11-oddmu">2023-09-11 Odd¬µ memory consumption</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, in terms of copyright incentives, handing off the entire site like that is tricky. Doing it with a feed feels OK. Doing it for a search engine seems like handing the keys to Google. This provides an incentive to use a pre-computed index.</p>

<p>It also reminds me that the idea I had of building a search engine out of feed slurping without consent is probably a bad idea ‚Äì like all ideas based on non-consensual acts.</p>

<p>Whether self-indexing is a good thing in terms of avoiding an English-first focus I don&rsquo;t know. I suspect that most people will be using free software and therefore there&rsquo;s no reason to suspect that a search engine doesn&rsquo;t have the means to process the languages. Then again, that&rsquo;s a lock-in where in order to support a new language, you have to support the software your favourite search-engine supports. So people indexing our own pages might have long term benefits.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still wondering about the comparison of Pagefind and Lunr, to be honest. How many such static search solutions are there? Is there a benefit of one implementation over another?</p>

<p>I guess now I should look into Pagefind some more? Indexing non-HTML pages, handling image previews for pages not in the root directory and relative image source URLs, the sort order of results, the use of the .html extension in results‚Ä¶ there are still rough edges as far as I am concerned ‚Äì and per discussion above the onus is on me to fix my indexing. üò≠</p>

<p><strong>2024-08-29</strong>. Would caching help? I don&rsquo;t think so.
Let&rsquo;s check!</p>

<p>First, a script to find an IP number that is doing many requests:
<a href="/admin/leech-detector">leech-detector</a>.</p>

<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# tail -n 10000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
  | bin/admin/leech-detector \
  | head
Total hits: 10000
IP                             |       Hits | Bandw. | Rel. | Interv. | Status
------------------------------:|-----------:|-------:|-----:|--------:|-------
                185.103.225.81 |       1057 |     0K |  10% |    1.7s | 302 (50%), 401 (49%), 200 (0%)
‚Ä¶

root@sibirocobombus ~# whois 185.103.225.81
‚Ä¶
org-name:       Muth Citynetz Halle GmbH
‚Ä¶
</code></pre>

<p>I have never heard of them. Sounds like a small hosting company,
responsible for 10% of all hits on my server, right now.
Let&rsquo;s print the status code they received from my web server and the path they requested.</p>

<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# grep 185.103.225.81 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
  | awk -e '{print $10, $8}' \
  | sort \
  | uniq -c
    524 /edit/logo.jpg
    529 /view/logo.jpg
      2 /view/RPG.rss
      2 /wiki/feed/full/RPG
</code></pre>

<p>This is simply broken shit that cannot be fixed by caching.</p>

<p>OK, let‚Äôs pick another IP number. Let‚Äôs look for an IP number that is
getting a lot of 200 results but isn‚Äôt accessing my fedi instance:</p>

<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# grep -v '^social' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
  | grep ' 200 ' \
  | bin/admin/leech-detector \
  | head
‚Ä¶
                51.210.214.160 |        411 |     4K |   0% |  155.8s | 200 (100%)
‚Ä¶

root@sibirocobombus ~# whois 51.210.214.160
‚Ä¶
org-name:       OVH SAS
‚Ä¶
</code></pre>

<p>This is totally a hosting provider. What are they hosting?</p>

<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# grep 51.210.214.160 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
  | awk -e '{print $10, $8}' \
  | sort \
  | uniq -c
‚Ä¶
      1 200 /wiki?action=rss;rcidonly=InterWiki
      1 200 /wiki?action=rss;rcidonly=InvestmentWebOfTrust
      1 200 /wiki?action=rss;rcidonly=IrcTranscription
      1 200 /wiki?action=rss;rcidonly=JohnCappiello
      1 200 /wiki?action=rss;rcidonly=JulianKrause

      1 200 /wiki?action=rss;rcidonly=KurzAnleitung
      1 200 /wiki?action=rss;rcidonly=LangageClair
‚Ä¶
</code></pre>

<p>For every single wiki page it learnt about its feed from meta data
and it indexing that. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Producing these feeds is
expensive. It can be a interesting service for humans that want to
monitor a page or two. It‚Äôs a waste of CO‚ÇÇ for machines that want to
pre-emptively ingest these pages. And since there are thousands of these
pages, every search bot ends up storing all the URLs, calling the wiki
engine every time to ask for the latest change, making it load the page
and check the metadata and send the reply, and TLS handshakes and
cryptography on top of all that. It hurts my heart to think of all this
waste. I think this is terrible design that cannot be fixed by adding
caching. My wiki does client side caching (pages are said to remain
fresh for 10s); http caching (with ETag header); html caching
(attempting to reduce the time spent parsing the wiki sources and
generating the html). In a way, these bots are forcing me to abandon
dynamically generated content on the open net ‚Äì or to waste more time
and energy for squid cashes or varnish, more RAM, more resources, more
of my time. And that‚Äôs what making me so angry. Dynamically generated
HTML is excellent for low traffic sites. These days, there seems to be
no more low traffic because robot traffic is so high. They keep the
caches warm, all the time, on a global scale.</p>

<p>I remain unhappy.</p>

## Adm. Grace Hopper‚Äôs 1982 NSA Lecture Has Been Published

<p>It&#8217;s a wonderful talk: funny, engaging, wise, prescient. Remember that talk was given in 1982, less than a year before the ARPANET switched to TCP/IP and the internet went operational. She was a remarkable person.</p>
<p>Listening to it, and thinking about the audience of NSA engineers, I wonder how much of what she&#8217;s talking about as the future of computing&#8212;miniaturization, parallelization&#8212;was being done in the present and in secret.</p>

## News on the web still sucks

date: 2024-08-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I can't read most of the stories I want to read. I have the money and am willing to spend it. But there is no system that allows me to pay. </p>
<p>On the other hand the distribution of video entertainment is somewhat functional, I spend an ungodly amount of mostly wasted money to get access to that. </p>
<p>I am not cheap. The news system realllly doesn't work. It could be fixed, but for the usual problem -- they would have to work with each other. </p>
<p>If you think the NYT is a huge success, compare its size to the size of Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon or Apple, all of whom have made great businesses out of distributing other people's products. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/29/marketcaps.png"></center>Market caps for Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and NYT.</div></p>
<p>We were getting somewhere with <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/03/132640.html?title=nytAndRss">RSS</a>, btw -- but the journalism industry lost its minds over Twitter, and let the tech industry own the distribution system, and now it's a total mess, a good time for a re-think, I think. </p>
<p>I generated graph in <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/8bbe7d22-89d4-4fc3-b3c3-d56993da3e00">ChatGPT</a> by just asking for it. It has great chart software built-in. Quietly they are rearranging all the pieces of software we use. They will end up owning everything, and meanwhile people are asking if this is a bubble. Not really. More like an invasion. </p>

But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug">this ad</a>, the best ever imho, says wait a minute, please reconsider. A campaign is a series of messages from candidate to electorate: "Is this who we are?" The great ads tap our optimism, imho.

## To a tiling WM user, apparently other GUIs are like wearing handcuffs

date: 2024-08-29, from: Liam on Linux

&nbsp;This is interesting to me. I am on the other side, and ISTM that the tiling WM folks are the camp you describe.<p>Windows  (2.01) was the 3rd GUI I learned. First was classic MacOS (System 6 and  early System 7.0), then Acorn RISC OS on my own home computer, then  Windows.</p><p>Both MacOS and RISC OS have beautiful, very mouse-centric GUIs where you <i>must</i>  use the mouse for most things. Windows was fascinating because it has  rich, well-thought-out, rational and consistent keyboard controls, and  they work everywhere. In all graphical apps, in the window manager  itself, <i>and on the command line</i>.</p><p>-- Ctrl + a letter is a discrete action: <i>do this thing now</i>.</p><p>-- Alt + a letter opens a menu</p><p>--  Shift moves selects in a continuous range: shift+cursors selects text  or files in a file manager. Shift+mouse selects multiple icons in a  block in a file manager.</p><p>-- Ctrl + mouse selects discontinuously: pick disconnected icons.</p><p>-- These can be combined: shift-select a block, then press ctrl <i>as well</i>  to add some discontinuous entries.</p><p>-- Ctrl + cursor keys moves a word at a time (discontinuous cursor movement).</p><p>-- Shift + ctrl selects a word at a time.</p><p>In the mid-'90s Linux made Unix affordable and I got to know it, and I switched to it early '00s.</p><p>But  it lacks that overall cohesive keyboard UI. Some desktops implement  most of Windows' keyboard UI (Xfce, LXDE, GNOME 2.x), some invent their  own (KDE), many don't have one.</p><p>The shell and editors don't have  any consistency. Each editor has its own set of keyboard controls, and  some environments honour some of them -- but not many because the  keyboard controls for an editor make little sense in a window manager.  What does &quot;insert mode&quot; mean in a file manager?</p><p>They are  keyboard-driven windowing environments built by people who live in  terminals and only know the extremely limited keyboard controls of the  most primitive extant shell environment, one that doesn't honour GUI  keyboard UI because it predates it and so in which every app invents its  own.</p><p>Whereas Windows co-evolved with IBM CUA and deeply embeds it.</p><p>The  result is that all the Linux tiling WMs I've tried annoy me, because  they don't respect the existing Windows-based keystrokes for  manipulating windows. GNOME &gt;=3 mostly doesn't either: keystrokes for  menu manipulation make little sense when you've tried to eliminate  menus from your UI.</p><p>Even the growing-in-trendiness MiracleWM  because the developer doesn't use plain Ubuntu, he uses Kubuntu, and  Kubuntu doesn't respect basic Ubuntu keystrokes like Ctrl+Alt+T for a  terminal, so neither does MiracleWM.</p><p>They are multiple  non-overlapping, non-cohesive, non-uniform keyboard UIs designed by and  for people who never knew how to use a keyboard-driven whole-OS UI  because they didn't know there was one. So they all built their own ones  without knowing that there's 30+ years of prior art for this.</p><p>All these little half-thought-out attempts to build something <i>that already existed</i> but its creators didn't know about it.</p><p>To extend the prisoners-escaping-jail theme:</p><p>Each  only extends the one prisoner cell that inmate knew before they got  out, where the prison cell is an app -- often a text editor but  sometimes it's one game.</p><p>One environment lets you navigate by only going left or straight.

An idea for the Harris campaign. Let me buy some <a href="https://store.kamalaharris.com/">swag</a> and have it sent to 10 of my best friends, esp ones who live in swing states. Plus you get the names and contact info for people at least one of your supporters thought would be a potential Harris voter. I'd send something less presumptuous like <i>When We Fight We Win</i> stickers. Another related idea, let me buy a whole set of promotional materials, kind of like the gift baskets they sell at <a href="https://www.zabars.com/zabars-babka-and-rugelach-crate/C110038.html">Zabar's</a>.

## 2024-08-28 Traveller and Mongoose

date: 2024-08-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-28-traveller-and-mongoose">2024-08-28 Traveller and Mongoose</h1>

<p>Marc Miller&rsquo;s email was reposted in a few places, like Usenet (oh yes,
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/news/article/rec.games.frp.misc/290">it was posted on rec.games.frp.misc</a>!),
<a href="https://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2024/08/concerning-future-of-traveller.html">Rob Conley&rsquo;s blog</a>,
and elsewhere. What are your thoughts on it?</p>

<p>I am of two minds. Mongoose has been
good for Traveller, I think. I liked Mongoose Traveller 1st ed., which
I ran for a bit, and I have no reason to doubt that the current Mongoose
Traveller 2nd ed. is as good a system the many other Traveller editions
out there.</p>

<p>I also have my doubts regarding Mongoose&rsquo;s quality in terms of editing
‚Äì but who am I kidding, these days people are cutting corners all over
the place and sometimes they&rsquo;re cutting corners in editing. It happens.
It&rsquo;s the Zeitgeist. I guess in the world of quality assurance Mongoose
wouldn&rsquo;t actually be all that bad because I&rsquo;m assuming they fix all the
typos in later printings. üòè</p>

<p>Also they based a lot of follow-up products on the Traveller system and
what&rsquo;s not to like about more 2d6 systems! üò∏</p>

<p>This at least ensures that they remain committed to the basic idea.
And maybe that means that the PDFs will remain around for much longer.
That&rsquo;s certainly better than ending up being managed by kids or being
sold off to the highest bidder after Miller&rsquo;s passing. It&rsquo;s not the
greatest plan but it&rsquo;s a plan. Wouldn&rsquo;t a real TAS be great? An
association that had a board elected by its members, the community?
An association based on Swiss law, like FIFA or the ICRC?
Anyway, that&rsquo;s a dream and it wouldn&rsquo;t be clear whether
it would work in the long run so perhaps passing it on to Mongoose
was the best idea after all.</p>

<p>I wonder if Mongoose has a better succession plan, though. Looking at
<a href="https://forum.mongoosepublishing.com/threads/state-of-the-mongoose-2023.124344/">State of Mongoose 2023</a>,
it seems that the whole company is owned by Matthew Sprange.
Is he so much younger than Marc Miller? What&rsquo;s the
long term plan, here?</p>

<p>Anyway. Thinking about what happens to our games when we die is a
good idea.</p>

<p>Perhaps Miller should have slapped a CC-BY-SA 4.0 or a CC0 onto the
products he owns and said: &ldquo;On the day I die, these licenses go
into effect immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not how these things go. I suspect some money changed
hands and that&rsquo;s probably for Miller&rsquo;s best.</p>

Two take-aways for Democrats. 1. Avoid NPR politics. 2. Appeal to college-educated white men. Most of them vote Republican, but with Walz on the ticket, they have a special ambassador, he represents that straight-talking country folk are part of the Democratic coalition. It's still true that white voters are the majority. Get a small number to vote Democratic could be enough to win the election. It never is about policy. It's about whether you are like them. That's what it means to avoid NPR politics. And btw, imho -- getting the press to like you might not be good. I wonder if the Dems would ever have the courage to sever itself from the journos. Imagine Harris saying "If the press says we're bad you know that means we're good." She could say that in her big interview. üòÄ

## 2024 Optical Media Durability Update

It is time once again for the mind-numbing process of feeding 45 disks through the readers to verify their checksums, and yet again this year every single MD5 was successfully verified. Below the fold, the details.<br />

The fields in the table are as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Month</i>: The date marked on the media in Sharpie, and verified via the on-disk metadata.</li>
<li><i>Media</i>: The type of media.</li>
<li><i>Good</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which all MD5 checksums were correctly verified.</li>
<li><i>Bad</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which any file failed MD5 verification.</li>
<li><i>Vendor</i>: the vendor name on the media</li>
</ul>
The drives I use from ASUS and LG report significant numbers of read errors from the CDs but verify the MD5s correctly. I didn't notice them reporting any read errors from the DVDs. An off-brand drive fails to read the CDs, but read one of the older DVDs with no read errors.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost media, and consumer drives, I'm getting good data from CD-Rs more than 20 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 18 years old. Your mileage may 
vary. Tune in again next year for another episode.<br />
<br />
I also checked my Memorex <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/08/optical-media-durability-update.html?showComment=1632161672704#c889599305877938325">NetBSD1.2 CD</a> written in October 1996. It has checksums generated by <tt>cksum(1)</tt>, all of which verified correctly despite a number of read errors. So that CD-R is delivering good data after nearly 28 years.<br />

Link:&#160;The Changing Role of the&#160;U.S.&#160;Dollar / Brookings&#160; TLDR: Whether&#160;it‚Äôs&#160;sanctions overuse,&#160;U.S.&#160;political&#160;dysfunction or&#160;crypto-led fintech innovations,&#160;the&#160;dollar can‚Äôt take its preeminence for granted anymore. Key Points: My Thoughts: More than military dominance, the&#160;U.S.&#160;dollar&#160;has been&#160;the key instrument for America‚Äôs global dominance.&#160;It remains so,&#160;but it&#160;will&#160;increasingly come under pressure due to digitization and disaggregation of money.&#160;This&#160;is very much&#160;a&#160;continuation of the ‚Äúrouting around &#8230;

Then, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/185200/kamala-wins-inside-clever-strategy-causing-trump-unravel">Greg Sargent's podcast</a> gave me an idea. The oppressor in a fascist state doesn't need you to love them, so long as you don't love anyone else. The NYT isn't trying to make us love Trump, that's impossible. But they are trying to make us not fall in love with Harris. I doubt they foresaw that possibility. But our feelings about Harris are very much love. The NYT is our only master, they must think. There's no room for us to love someone else, because we might listen to them. In a sense they respond like a first born child on the arrival of their little sister or brother. I don't know. As I said it doesn't matter why. That's their problem. Our problem is to get them out of the way.

The NYT et al aren't even doing a fair job of covering the election as a horserace, because they're making sure it's a virtual tie, so even if our team has overwhelming power, speed and depth, and gets on base in every at bat and plays by the rules, our odds are no better than the other team.

## The status of Twitter's API

date: 2024-08-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>The Twitter API still works, with some serious limits. Not easily incorporated into products, but useful for individuals with developer accounts. Not an insurmountable hurdle, it seems, though I was a developer from before. A few bullet points.</p>
<ul>
<li>My linkblog now reliably works on <a href="https://x.com/davewiner">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew">Threads</a>, in addition to <a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>, <a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">RSS</a> and <a href="https://linkblog3.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>.   </li>
<li>I was confused about the status of the Twitter API, but it turns out it's still there, and there is a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2">package</a> that connects to it for Node apps. </li>
<li>It took me a few hours to add <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js#L543">support for Twitter</a> in my <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main">textcasting</a> server app which is how my software connects to all the various services. </li>
<li>I should probably add a plugin abilitiy for textcasting so that other services could easily be added, without modifying the core app. Totally doable. It's already factored that way internally.</li>
<li>I should probably write <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md">some docs</a> for it too. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></li>
<li>Anyway, the <a href="https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api">deal with Twitter</a> is that it's free for up to 1500 posts per month, as I read it, which seems manageable for one person (me), but no way is it enough for a community of users. </li>
<li>Why connect to Twitter? People are there. Until they aren't we're going to need a way to push stuff to Twitter.</li>
</ul>

## A tunnel in time

The last time I did any work on this code, or even in this area of computer science, was approx 1990. It comes right back, like riding a bike. I saw a tremendous amount of potential fun here, but I had to move on to runtime, object database, verbs, user interface -- for Frontier. In the 34 years between then and now -- a lot of software has been written, and I'm only looking at a fraction of it, limited to stuff that runs in Node, the browser and Electron. And I have to say I'm totally enjoying reading about what they've done. I'm learning about evolution of technology, a facet of development I am extremely drawn to, in a whole new way, as if viewed through a tunnel in time. </p>

## US Federal Court Rules Against Geofence Warrants

date: 2024-08-26, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-25-gotosocial-problems">2024-08-25 GoToSocial problems</h1>

<p>So you&rsquo;re considering self-hosting? You heard good things about <a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial">GoToSocial</a>? I like it. I use it. This post is about the problems you should be expecting at the moment.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising, after all. This is a very prominent sentence in their README:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GoToSocial is still ALPHA SOFTWARE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what are the exact problems? Sometimes alpha software is good enough, right?</p>

<h2 id="major-annoyances">Major annoyances</h2>

<p><strong>No post editing</strong>. I hope you can handle your own typos. All you have is &ldquo;Delete and Redraft&rdquo;. But that orphans all replies, undoes all boosts, forgets all likes and removes posts from bookmarks. &ldquo;Delete and Redraft&rdquo; is a sledge hammer. &ldquo;Edit post&rdquo; is a delicate quill. And you don&rsquo;t get to have it. YOLO! (You only live once.)</p>

<p><strong>No filtering</strong>. You can mute and block and all that, but when everybody is posting about Monsterdon, the European Song Contest, the US elections, Caturday or Wordle, you can&rsquo;t filter those hashtags. You must endure the enthusiasm of the people you are following. (I think the developers are implementing things, but it does not seem to have an effect in the front-ends I use, so who knows.)</p>

<p><strong>Limited federation</strong>. This one is hard to spot. You want to follow this account and that account and it all seems to work until you go back and find that for one account, your follow request seems to hang in limbo, waiting. You cancel, and follow again. It seems to work. Come back later, back in limbo again, waiting. If you check the log, you&rsquo;ll find errors about signatures failing and what not. I have no idea. There are currently <a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+signature">8 open issues containing the word &lsquo;signature&rsquo;</a>. Something is not working and you&rsquo;ll have to have an alt (a separate account) on a different server that doesn&rsquo;t have this issue. That makes me sad. üò•</p>

<h2 id="minor-annoyances">Minor annoyances</h2>

<p><strong>No automatic post expiry</strong>. You&rsquo;ll have to use something like <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/mastodon-archive.git/">Mastodon Archive</a>.</p>

<h2 id="no-problem">No problem</h2>

<p><strong>No front-end</strong>. There is no front-end. I use apps like <a href="https://mastodon.social/@tootapp">Toot!</a> on my phone and <a href="https://semaphore.social/">Semaphore</a> on the web. I don&rsquo;t need anything fancy. And for the non-fancy options, I have <a href="https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el">mastodon.el</a> for Emacs, <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot">toot</a> for the command-line, <a href="https://tuba.geopjr.dev/">tuba</a> for Gnome, <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bitlbee-mastodon.git/">bitlbee-mastodon</a> for IRC, and so on. There are plenty of options.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-stuff">The good stuff</h2>

<p><strong>Markdown</strong> in your posts. I like my code blocks.</p>

<p><strong>SQLite</strong> on the server. It&rsquo;s currently 8.4G. The media stuff is 11G.</p>

<p><strong>Memory footprint</strong>. I use Monit to monitor processes and this process uses 185.6 MB.</p>

<p><strong>No admin</strong>. I haven&rsquo;t had to run any administration task. Not once. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
