## Guest post: "Some thoughts on computers", by Chris da Kiwi

date: 2024-09-20, from: Liam on Linux

<em>A friend of mine via the Ubuntu mailing list for the last couple of decades, Chris is bedbound now and tells me he's in his final weeks of life. He shared with me a piece he's written. I've lightly edited it before sharing it, and if he's feeling up to it, there is some more he wants to say. We would welcome thoughts and comments on it.<br /><br /></em><span><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Liberation Serif&quot;; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some thoughts on Computers</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">&nbsp;</p></span><span><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">The basic design of computers hasn't changed much since the mechanical one, the Difference Engine, invented by Charles Babbage in 1822 &ndash; but not built until 1991. Alan Turing invented computer science, and the ENIAC in 1945 was arguably the first electronic general-purpose digital computer. It filled a room.

In fact, the only difference in the plastic on display was how much drive space had the engineers fitted in, and how much RAM did they have. Was the case a pretty colour, that appealed to the latest 10-year-old-girl, or a rugged he-man, who was hoping to make the school whatever team? In other words, rows of blah.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Where was the excitement of the early Radio Shack &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; range: the Sinclair ZX80, the Commodore 8-bits (PET and VIC-20), later followed by the C64? What has happened to all the excitement and innovation? My answer is simple: the great big clobbering machine known as &quot;Big Tech&quot;.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><a style="text-decoration-line: none;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Intel released its first 8080 processor in 1972 and later followed up with variations on a theme</span></a><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"> [PDF], eventually leading to the 80286, the 80386, the 80486 (getting useful), and so on. All of these variations needed an operating system which basically was a variation of MS-DOS, or more flexibly, PC DOS. Games started to appear, and some of them were quite good. But the main driver of the computer was software.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">In particular, word-processors and spreadsheets.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">At the time, my lost computer soul had found a niche in CP/M, which on looking back was a lovely little operating system &ndash; but quietly disappeared into the badlands of marketing.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Lost and lonely I wandered the computerverse until I hooked up with Sanyo &ndash; itself now long gone the way of the velociraptor and other lost prehistoric species.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">The Sanyo bought build quality, the so-called &quot;lotus card&quot; to make it fully compatible with the IBM PC, and later, an RGB colour monitor and a 10 gig hard drive. The basic model was still two 5&frac14;&quot; floppy drives, which they pushed up to 720kB, and later the 3.&frac12;&quot; 1.25MB floppy drives. Ahead of its time, it too went the way of the dinosaur.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">These led to the Sanyo AT-286, which became a mainstay, along with the Commodore 64. A pharmaceutical company had developed a software system for pharmacies that included stock control, ordering, and sales systems. I vaguely remember that machine and software bundle was about NZ$ 15,000, which was far too rich for most.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Then the computer landscape began to level out, as the component manufacturers began to settle on the IBM PC-AT as a compatible, open-market model of computer that met the Intel and DOS standards. Thus, the gradual slide into 100 versions of mediocrity.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">The consumer demand was for bigger and more powerful machines, whereas the industry wanted to make more profits. A conflict to which the basic computer scientists hardly seemed to give a thought.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"><br /><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">I was reminded of Carl Jung's dictum: that &ldquo;greed would destroy the West.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">A thousand firms sprang up, all selling the same little boxes, whilst the marketing voices kept trumpeting the bigger/better/greater theme&hellip; and the costs kept coming down, as businesses became able to afford these machines, and head offices began to control their outlying branches through the mighty computer.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">I headed overseas, to escape the bedlam, and found a spot in New Guinea &ndash; only to be overrun by a mainframe run from Australia, which was going to run my branch &ndash; for which I was responsible, but without any control.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Which side of the fence was I going to land on?

The desktop was being chased by the laptop, until I stood at a long row of shiny boxes that were basically all the same, wondering which one my wife would like&hellip; knowing that it would have to connect to the so-called &quot;internet&quot;, and in doing so, make all sorts of decisions inevitable.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Eventually I chose a smaller Asus, with 16GB of main RAM and an nVidia card, and retreating to my cottage, collapsed in despair. Fifty years of computing and wasted innovation left her with a black box that, when she opened, it said &ldquo;HELLO&rdquo; against a big blue background that promised the world &ndash; but only offered more of the same.&nbsp; As in, a constant trickle of hackers, viruses, Trojans and barely anything useful &ndash; but now included a new perversion called a chat-bot or &ldquo;AI&rdquo;.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">I retired to my room in defeat.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">We have had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_processors#All_processors">incremental developments</a>, until we have today's latest chips from Intel and AMD based on the 64-bit architecture first introduced around April 2003.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">So where is the 128-bit architecture &ndash; or the 256 or the 512-bit?</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">What would happen if we got </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">really</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"> innovative? I still remember Bill Gates saying &quot;Nobody will ever need more than 640k of RAM.&quot; And yet, it is common now to buy machines with 8 or 16 or 32GB of RAM, because the poor quality of operating systems fills the memory with poorly-written garbage that causes memory leaks, stack-overflow errors and other memory issues.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Then there is Unix &ndash; or since the advent of Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds, GNU/Linux.

## 2024-09-21 Getting started with that open table

date: 2024-09-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-21-getting-started-with-that-open-table">2024-09-21 Getting started with that open table</h1>

<p>It‘s not that easy, unfortunately.</p>

<p>We used a dedicated channel where referees post game dates, and when people say they want to play on that day, the announcement is updated to include their name. If not enough people sign up, the game is cancelled.</p>

<p>There is a social channel that provides community and prevents the server from falling away into ignored-land. Not sure how important that is.</p>

<p>We keep signing up and chat about the game in a separate channel so that the “next games” channel sticks out.</p>

<p>If the pool of players is small, offer a role to people interested and tag it in the announcements.</p>

<p>That‘s all I got.</p>

<p>Going from “referee proposes a date and players sign up” to “players ask me for available dates and recruit fellow players to the expedition” took me <a href="2024-09-05-player-organized">45 sessions</a>…</p>

Has anyone attempted to make a higher level language on top of SQL? It's taken me a few iterations over years to finally (I hope) figure out how to design a table to take advantage of the features that evolved into making SQL efficient for the applications people really deploy. If this were machine language, it would be time to start thinking about the HLL that it inspires. Actually long past time imho.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/runner.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">This is a test. For the next sixty seconds this station will conduct a test of a new server app that combines the functionality of several apps I used to run as separate servers. The goal is to be able to integrate the functionality of all the components. It's time to invest in blogging in a real way. The <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">2017 corner-turn</a> was about getting back to the foundation I had before trying to co-exist with Twitter, Facebook, Medium. All three are now no longer high value targets for interop. So while I wasted a lot of time trying to <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/08/152655.html">peer</a> with them, I did finally get off the horse and I had a decent setup while developed <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a> and <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> and in doing so learned how to do scalable server apps with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>. I've wasted so much time trying to be compatible with apps that didn't want us. I have a feeling that none of the current targets really want us either. So let's get back to the <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html">Open Web</a>, which gave us much hope before. I think we can do a lot with feeds and <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a>. They're to open systems what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a> is to open source. You don't get to be half-committed to being open, you have to be all-in or you can't play. (Same idea as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+podcasting">podcasting</a>, which of course is just an instance of <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>.) You don't have to deal with a lot of confusion to find the interop. You just have to be willing to look in that direction. This started out as a test post and look what it has become.

My Pixel 9 Pro keeps giving me tips on using it when I bring it up, as I'm trying to read an important message, or change something at a red light. I'm always distracted when I use the phone, and by adding more distractions to sell me on something, that's not their right. I paid $1300 for this new phone. And also I can't figure out how to get the phone to ring when I get a call. I keep missing important calls.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I keep discovering uses for ChatGPT. I think it would be very useful to learn a language, for example. I know how to say this in English, could you explain to me, in English, how to say it in French. I bet it's very good at that. I am using it to learn to write SQL code that takes advantage of all the arcane features they've added over the years to handle cases that come up in real database work. It's anything but a new language, and efficiency is everything -- so I think they pretty much have all the cases covered. I remember how frustrating it was to learn Algol when all I knew before that was Fortran and Basic. It would have been great to have ChatGPT to coach me on it.

## Driving on a mountain road

I drive it fairly regularly, and I have a car that handles well so I drive at the speed limit or a little above. </p>
<p>Still, what often happens on this road is some asshole tailgates, getting so close that if I hit the brakes suddenly they would have no time to react, and would slam into the rear of my car. And you do sometimes have to hit the brakes because animals appear on the road, deer, turkeys are common. Sometimes even bears. </p>
<p>I've never hit an animal, but I have come close.  </p>
<p>There's no way to pass on this road. </p>
<p>I've been in the other driver's place when a tourist is driving 30 in a 45 mph zone, and what do you do? Keep your distance and don't freak out. It's perfectly legal to go 30 in a 45 mph zone. </p>
<p>Anyway I slow down, to send a signal to the other driver, and also to mitigate damage if there is an accident. This asshole leans on their horn. I slow down more. </p>
<p>And when I come to a stop sign I come to a full stop and pause, thinking okay they'll pass me now, and I'll get a chance to see who this asshole is. They stayed behind and leaned on the horn again.  </p>
<p>When we come to the next stop sign, it's the end of the road and you can go left or right. I'm going right, they're going left, and the road is wide so the asshole pulls up to the left of me and I look over and see a middle-aged woman, could be a teacher or a nurse. I was amazed. The last kind of person I would expect to make such a scene. </p>
<p>If I had a chance I would have asked what the hell they were doing. </p>
<p>BTW, I don't speed on these roads because I like driving them, I love the mountains, and the fresh air, and I wasn't in any kind of a hurry. It's not uncommon to get a tailgater but usually they take the hint when I slow down and add a few car lengths between us. </p>
<p>One of the reasons I have a blog is so I have a place to write these stories. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

## trurl 0.16

date: 2024-09-19, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

(Download trurl here) Release presentation At 08:00 UTC I will do a live-streamed release presentation of trurl 0.16 on Twitch. Bump I decided to bump the minor version number again because there is a new option: --qtrim. This is the old --trim option made simpler and specialized for query components only. When we added originally &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/09/19/trurl-0-16/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">trurl 0.16</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## ★ The iPhones 16

What more proof of the camera’s singular importance to the iPhone would one need than the ever-growing block of camera lenses on the back of each year’s new models, or the “Shot on iPhone” ad campaign? A dedicated hardware button?

## Aesthetic fascism

date: 2024-09-19, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Aesthetics seem to come before functionality in tech now&#8230; My husband and I both have new old Pixel phones (6a and 7a), which we both *hate* in comparison to the 3a we had previously. The new phones are exceedingly slippery, sliding off of seemingly flat surfaces constantly. They&#8217;re too large to comfortably hold, for either [&#8230;]

## 2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China

date: 2024-09-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-18-emacs-wiki-and-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</h1>

<p><strong>2024-09-14</strong>. I&rsquo;m somewhere in the Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland with my wife. There is a lot of running, hiking, hugging, kissing, eating and drinking involved. 🥰</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-15</strong>. Still on the trip but late at night I spent more than an hour trying to figure out why my server had a load of nearly 40. 💻</p>

<p>All I discovered is that load went down when I shut down Emacs Wiki. See also <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2024-09-16">2024-09-16</a> on Emacs Wiki.</p>

<p>Well, I needed to sleep and I‘ve got plans for the next few days so I shut it down while I slept hoping that the misconfigured spider is fixed or the inept programmer discovers their mistake. Just another day in the Butlerian Jihad. Some misguided soul probably wanted to download it all and wrote a broken web crawler and when that got blocked they bought some nice scaling infrastructure from Amazon, Hetzner, OHV or Alibaba Cloud or whatever they are called, allowing them to use a gazillion different IP numbers that will eventually lead me to implement some sort of cloud service provider block.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-09-15-emacs-china.png" alt="Load shoots up to nearly 40 around midnight. The graph is for an entire week so the peaks are not shown. It just goes up to 30 multiple times." /></p>

<p><strong>2024-09-16</strong>. Switched Emacs Wiki back on after a few hours of sleep and it did fine. But then it restarted again&hellip; at 18:00, 19:00, 21:00, 22:00&hellip; and so I switched Emacs Wiki off again. Time to ban some networks!</p>

<p>Anybody interested in my banning of IP ranges and possibly interested in me reverting any of these, take a look at <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> &hellip; from a network that isn&rsquo;t banned, I guess. 😏</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-17</strong>. This continues to keep me busy and angry every evening. Too bad I don&rsquo;t have a real fast <a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> to firewall ban pipeline. I&rsquo;m using this script instead of carefully checking IP numbers and networks. I&rsquo;m also sick and tired of the same networks popping up again and again.</p>

<p>I added over a hundred Chinese networks to the firewall rules and I&rsquo;m seriously considering blocking the whole country for a week. It seems that most of the offenders are networks run by China Telecoms and China Mobile.</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-18</strong>. So far, so good. Load stays below two.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s example usage for <code>network-lookup</code>, filtering for Emacs Wiki and a URL parameter used when requesting recent changes or a RSS feed for a single page only. That would count as suspicious misbehaving crawler behaviour in my book.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, all deserve to be banned. Over-banning? Maybe. What do you think?</p>

<p>For demonstration purposes, this is what I ran:</p>

<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus.root grep '&quot;^www.emacswiki.org.*rcidonly&quot;' /var/log
/apache2/access.log \
| tail -n 20 \
| ssh sibirocobombus.root bin/admin/network-lookup \
| wl-copy
</code></pre>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m ready to ban them all:</p>

<pre><code>wl-paste | grep ipset

## Remotely Exploding Pagers

date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-attack-hezbollah/index.html">Wow</a>.</p>
<p>It seems they all exploded simultaneously, which means they were triggered.</p>
<p>Were they each tampered with physically, or did someone figure out how to trigger a thermal runaway remotely? Supply chain attack? Malicious code update, or natural vulnerability?</p>
<p>I have no idea, but I expect we will all learn over the next few days.</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD: I&#8217;m <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-september-17-2024/">reading</a> nine killed and 2,800 injured. That&#8217;s a <i>lot</i> of collateral damage. (I haven&#8217;t seen a good number as to the number of pagers yet.)</p>

It is generally quite difficult to upset the denizens of a <a href="https://www.quotes.net/mquote/90955">wretched hive of scum and villainy</a> by further besmirching their reputation, but recently the Trump family has succeeded.<br />
<br />
Below the fold I explain how they did it, and why the denizens of the wretched hive are not happy.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Matt Levine identified the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-10/the-fastest-options-are-the-most-fun">fundamental mechanism</a> at play here:<br />
<blockquote>
But you don’t have to just take your counterparties as you find them; you can work to encourage and develop bad ones. This is often a matter of product development: If you build a product that does nothing for sophisticated professionals but that is really good for noisy addicted gamblers, you will attract exactly the right sort of counterparty. This arguably explains much of crypto.
</blockquote>
The additional point he omitted is that, in order to "attract exactly the right sort of counterparty" you have to advertise the product. This will bring it to the attention of others seeking the same kind of counterparty. They will seek to leverage your product design for their own ends.<br />
<br />
Trump has perfected the art of attracting "the right sort of counterparty". From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University">Trump University</a> to the banks he stiffed in his <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019">multiple bankruptcies</a>, to the stockholders of Truth Social his counterparties have always been the "<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/09/poker-patsy/">sucker at the poker table</a>". Key to this success has always been moving on to the next scam as the previous one implodes.<br />
<br />
By the side of the road to <strike>Damascus</strike> the White House the former crypto-skeptic President encountered a small crowd of large cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase, Ripple, Andreessen Horowitz and Jump Capital. They were waving <a href="https://followthecrypto.org/">immense sums of money</a>. Trump underwent an instant conversion to the cryptocurrency faith, announcing he would make the US the "<a href="https://coinaute.com/en/trump-harris-debate-the-ignored-cryptocurrencies/">Bitcoin capital of the world</a>".<br />
<br />
Apart from the general idea that "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FSVSL6NZnU">more is better</a>", why would these immense sums of money be attractive to this alleged billionaire? Apart from the costs of running a Presidential campaign, some of which ends up in his own pocket, there is the need to pay his legions of lawyers, and the looming judgements that these lawyers failed to avert, including $88.3M before interest to E. Jean Carroll and $454M before interest in his New York fraud case.<br />
<br />
With <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-earnings-results-revenue-4f6701cbebcbc5c9ed5079ab096cb346">Truth Social's Q2 financials</a> reporting a loss of 1,911% of revenue, which was down 30% year-on-year, and with the stock down 80% from its peak, it was clearly time to move on.<br />
<br />
On 31<sup>st</sup> August Jasper Goodman posted <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/31/trump-crypto-family-affair-00176764"><i>Crypto is the new Trump family business. Ethics watchdogs have concerns.</i></a> rating a well-deserved "Well Duh!":<br />
<blockquote>
Trump’s eldest sons are gearing up to launch a new cryptocurrency venture called <a href="https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/">World Liberty Financial</a>, which is already receiving a big social media boost from their father. Government ethics watchdogs say the project could create a conflict of interest if Trump returns to the White House next year.<br />
<br />
Trump has vowed to enact an array of pro-crypto policies in a bid to win votes — and campaign cash — from digital asset enthusiasts in recent months. Now, he’s <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1829141447087648796">weaving the overtures</a> into his pitch for his sons’ forthcoming startup.<br />
<br />
While the details of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.'s crypto endeavor haven’t yet been announced, it could stand to benefit from a second Trump administration’s approach to support the industry.<br />
...<br />
<a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/president-trump-legacy-corruption-3700-conflicts-interest/">CREW identified more than 3,700</a> conflicts of interest during Trump’s first term.<br />
<br />
But critics said the crypto project differs because it could align his family’s financial interest with policy changes that he would be poised to enact.<br />
<br />
“The prior conflicts and illegalities took advantage of preexisting loopholes,” said Norman Eisen, an ethics lawyer who served in the Obama White House and later helped build the first impeachment case against Trump. “Here, Trump appears to be promising to create the loopholes while his family is simultaneously designing a business venture to exploit them.”
</blockquote>
The headline on World Financial's "coming soon" web page is "World Liberty Financial - The Only Crypto DeFi Platform supported by Donald J. Trump". There are dozens of "DeFi Platforms", but the unique selling point of World Liberty is that it is "supported by Donald J. Trump". So the counterparties it is intended to attract are the gullible members of the Trump cult, the ones who have allegedly made him a billionaire.<br />
<br />
With this unique selling point the actual product doesn't need to be very good to compete with the market leader, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/decentralized-crypto-exchanges-market-share">Uniswap</a>, for its chosen counterparties. As Molly White reported, <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-65/">it wasn't</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
CoinDesk has gotten hold of a white paper for this supposed World Liberty Financial, which they note appears to be a clone of Dough Finance, a crypto lending platform that was hacked for around $2 million just a month and a half ago. The hack was not a sophisticated one, and instead exploited sloppiness on behalf of the development team.
</blockquote>
Of course, many people interested in gullible counterparties noticed all the hype, and they didn't have to wait to hack the actual product launch to <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-65/">get in on the action</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The project hasn’t even launched yet, and it’s off to a bumpy start. First, Donald Trump Jr. had to issue a statement to try to stop people from buying up all the fake tokens purporting to be associated with their murky project. Then, Twitter accounts for Lara and Tiffany Trump were both compromised and used to send tweets announcing a supposed token launch. “This is a scam!!!” tweeted Eric, himself retweeting the tweet from his wife’s account containing the scam token address.
</blockquote>
Nic Carter tweeted:<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">can't secure twitter accounts but i'm sure they'll be able to protect an (already hacked) defi protocol from hacks</p>— nic carter (@nic__carter) <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1831148088125161477?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> 
The reason for this fiasco was that, as usual, the Trumps hired "<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-boasts-hiring-best-picks-haunt">only the best people</a>". Sam Kessler, Danny Nelson &amp; Cheyenne Ligon dug into the project's white paper in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/09/03/inside-the-trump-crypto-project-linked-to-a-2m-defi-hack-and-former-pick-up-artist/"><i>Inside the Trump Crypto Project Linked to a $2M DeFi Hack and Former Pick-Up Artist</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The document and other reporting describe a borrowing and lending service strikingly similar to <a href="https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/3SMOuGMCSttY4pQW6I49W2-dough-finance-incident-analysis">Dough Finance, a recently hacked blockchain app</a> built by four people listed as World Liberty Financial team members. Other participants include all three of Trump's sons (including 18-year-old Barron, who is identified as the project's "DeFi visionary"), financiers and e-commerce influencers.
</blockquote>
The leader of the Dough Finance team was Chase Herro. When it came time to move on, he obviously found in the Trumps the ignorant and greedy counterparty he needed. Zeke Faux and Muyao Shen also piled on with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-13/behind-the-trump-crypto-project-is-a-self-described-dirtbag-of-the-internet"><i>Behind the Trump Crypto Project Is a Self-Described ‘Dirtbag of the Internet’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Herro, a fast-talking 39-year-old who shows off his fancy cars and private-jet rides on social media, is an unknown in the crypto world. More than a dozen prominent digital-asset investors said in interviews they had never heard of him. The only crypto project with which he was publicly affiliated attracted only a few million dollars and suffered a devastating hack. A token he promoted on influencer Logan Paul’s podcast dropped 96% afterward. In one speech in 2018, he called himself “the dirtbag of the internet” and said that regulators should “kick s---heads like me out.”<br />
<br />
“You can literally sell s--- in a can, wrapped in piss, covered in human skin, for a billion dollars if the story's right, because people will buy it,” Herro said about crypto in a 2018 YouTube video recorded as he drove in a Rolls-Royce. “I'm not going to question the right and wrong of all that.”

Jasper Goodman reported on the cryptosphere's reaction to this incompetent blatant grift in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/06/trump-family-crypto-startup-00177566"><i>‘A huge mistake’: Trump’s crypto allies cringe over family’s startup</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“This is a huge mistake,” said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter who is a founding partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Castle Island Ventures. “It looks like Trump’s inner circle is just cashing in on his recent embrace of crypto in a kind of naive way, and frankly it looks like they’re burning a lot of the good will that’s been built with the industry so far.”<br />
...<br />
“It’s a very typical playbook of smaller operators or more amateur operations in the crypto space to try to generate a lot of hype before revealing the details,” said Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business who previously led the risk and portfolio management operation at the crypto firm Paxos. “That makes them susceptible to all sorts of nonsense.”<br />
...<br />
One crypto industry representative in Washington, granted anonymity because of sensitivities around criticizing Trump, described having “a laundry list of concerns.” A big worry is that that it could reflect poorly on the industry as it pushes for policy changes that would help legitimize the sector.<br />
<br />
“Maybe it doesn’t move the needle for most people, but if this thing is hacked or regular folks lose money on it or it opens up the door for the SEC to investigate the team, it only looks like it has downside risk,” Carter said. “It looks to have very little upside risk.”
</blockquote>
As with Trump University and Truth Social, the whole point is for "regular folks" to lose money. But, if you're a candidate positioning yourself as pro-crypto in the hope of getting large checks from the cryptosphere,  making this obvious to everyone but the cult members is a bad idea.<br />

I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he's a human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or bad. If my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">theory</a> is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it's a valid point, Bluesky was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically global object storage with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It can't hurt to talk about what-if's instead of barrelling down the same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00's. I've been writing about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let's start talking about how we break out, because it's not going to "just happen" organically.

## Python Developers Targeted with Malware During Fake Job Interviews

date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting social engineering attack: luring potential job applicants with fake recruiting pitches, trying to <a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/fake-recruiter-coding-tests-target-devs-with-malicious-python-packages">convince them</a> to download malware. From a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/python-developers-targeted-by-north-korean-lazarus-group-with-fake-jobs-and-malware-disguised-as-coding-tests">news article</a></p>
<blockquote><p>These particular attacks from North Korean state-funded hacking team Lazarus Group are new, but the overall malware campaign against the Python development community has been running since at least August of 2023, when a number of popular open source Python tools were maliciously duplicated with added malware. Now, though, there are also attacks involving &#8220;coding tests&#8221; that only exist to get the end user to install hidden malware on their system (cleverly hidden with Base64 encoding) that allows remote execution once present. The capacity for exploitation at that point is pretty much unlimited, due to the flexibility of Python and how it interacts with the underlying OS...</p></blockquote>

## Why do blogging and fiction writing use different creative energy?

date: 2024-09-16, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Both blogs and books are written for an audience, but blogs are a dialogue, while fiction is a narrative. I use blogging as a tool for thinking and making meaning. Fiction writing is not itself a sense-making process for me, but told out of &#8212; after &#8212; sense-making. Blog posts construct an argument as they [&#8230;]

I started out that way 40+ years ago, and somewhere along the line I stopped thinking that way.

We've rarely seen it as a human thing both by the people who make the meals and the people who love great food. The world thinks of it as billionaires and influencers and lying fascist politicians.

## How I cross-post to Threads

date: 2024-09-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Twitter, WordPress and RSS. </p>
<p>Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,</p>
<p><a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">The RSS feed</a> is doing a lot of the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Links from the RSS feed show up on my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links page</a> and in the <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly emails</a>.</li>
<li>The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through micro.blog. I am able to <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">give</a> it the <a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">URL</a> of the linkblogging feed, and then click on <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png">Add Threads</a> -- and that's it. When I post something to the feed it shows up on Threads. </li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most people don't know it's there. It's sort of a Grand Central station for moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you're a micro.blog user, its <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">Feeds page</a> is where you set it up. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/microblogScreen.png">Screen shot</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="label">Part 1</span> Automation is driving the next wave of commoditization, threatening to replace skilled workers</h4>
      <p>As we have said before, the software industry has a decades-long history of cost-cutting, commoditization, and a successful sales model of "pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap." This has worrying consequences if your skill set is the next one to be commoditized. But there may be ways out of this narrowing commercial bottleneck.</p>

I still  have the SHARP  Zaurus SL-C3200. A  cute tiny clamshell  PDA - actually  a tiny  Linux  laptop. I  have  got it  when  it was  already obsolete and  used it little.  It's the  most expensive model  with the biggest RAM (128  MB, I think), the bigges storage  space (the 6GB HDD) and - of course - the biggest power consumption.

<p>I&rsquo;ve got to say, I&rsquo;m lurking in various pregnancy/&ldquo;new parent&rdquo; subreddits and it&rsquo;s weird to me how often I see comments like &ldquo;in our parents&rsquo; generation breastfeeding was discouraged&rdquo; or &ldquo;dads didn&rsquo;t change nappies then&rdquo; or whatever. I was born in the early 90s and my mum/aunts absolutely felt the same enormous pressure to make breastfeeding work as exists today… and the men did their fair share of active baby care (including, but not limited to, changing nappies). Yeah, some things were different, but the 90s aren&rsquo;t THAT long ago. These people are talking like they were the Dark Ages…</p>

For me, Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for ActivityPub but that's more complicated than it may seem. As often is the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn't work, when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users, completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I think it's better if we, as users, remain diversified.

## Hibiclens

date: 2024-09-14, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Every two-to-four years my body chemistry changes and my armpits start to reject my deodorant with an intense itch. All that aluminum has gunked up the works I guess. Usually cycling out deodorants works fine, but this time it didn’t work because my armpits were overpowering all the other deodorants.</p>
<p>I tried a tactical reset and took the  “<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/06/vibe-check-33/">No deodorant challenge</a>”, the legend –which I remember my hippie step-brother Nik telling me about thirty years ago– that if you stop using deodorant for two weeks the oils in your body naturally recalibrate and you stops smelling… but this urban legend very much did not work. I smelled horrible all the time.</p>
<p>I casually mentioned this issue to my dermatologist and he was quick to recommend this homely teal bottle of over-the-counter 1970s logotype, <a href="https://hibiclens.com/">Hibiclens</a>.</p>
<picture>
  <source srcset="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/hibiclens-landscape.png" media="(orientation: landscape)"></source>
  <img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/hibiclens.png" alt="A teal blue bottle of medicinal looking antiseptic cleaner">
</picture>
<p>I like to think the “hibi” part of Hibiclens stands for “hibiscus” because it’s a pink liquid (or foam) that you apply like soap and rinse off. It’s colored pink because it’s an anti-septic and hospitals like to color their liquids, but the reason it works –as my dermatologist explained– is that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/31/396573607/meet-the-bacteria-that-make-a-stink-in-your-pits">bacteria creates the odor in your armpits</a>. That was news to me. My prior understanding was that puberty causes teenagers to grow green stink lines that shoot out from their bodies. Guess the science there has evolved.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that Hibiclens works wonderfully and I’m pleased with the results. I don’t wear deodorant everyday anymore, my armpits aren’t irritated, and I only need to apply a squeeze of Hibiclens every three days or so (but even that timeline appears to be stretching out). I do sometimes wear deodorant when the stakes are high, but day-to-day working form home is <em>au naturale</em>. There’s a small satisfaction that the answer to my fragile-masculine deodorant FOR MEN problems is a pink liquid in a Tiffany blue teal bottle. Time will tell, however, if it really does solve my problems. I’ll follow up in two-to-four years to see if it still works.</p>

BTW the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaWeblog">Wikipedia page</a> for the MetaWeblog positions it as a replacement for the Blogger API, but it's an extension of it. You could use MetaWeblog to publish to Blogger sites, but it also supported features that Blogger didn't have, that were in our blogging software, Manila.

Could we agree that ChatGPT can ingest everything that's in Wikipedia? I particularly want the images. I'd like to ask for a picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry">Chuck Berry</a>, and get something nice and be able to put him in a scene with the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wordle+kitty%22">Wordle Kitty</a>. That seems pretty harmless. And the news industry could hardly object, they didn't invent Chuck Berry, or own the copyright of the picture of him in Wikipedia.

I'm searching for some common ground between the twitter-like systems, a basis for interop, a common API even. We had that for the blogging layer of this onion, something called the <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog">MetaWeblog API</a>.  All the popular blogging software supported it. And that meant you could write once and publish to many places. And you could write the script that did that in an afternoon or two. We started out with simple systems and the best of intentions. There's no technical barrier. And we could do it in a few weeks at most if there was a will to do it

## Hecklers

date: 2024-09-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C_5i0bLpwNe">Hecklers</a> at last night's rally in Greensboro, couldn't hear what they were angry about, but it had something to do with Gaza.</p>
<p>The US isn't doing the killing there, the issue is with Netanyahu who is part of the same political party as Trump. So you can be pretty sure the killing won't stop there at least until after our election. One way to be sure the killing continues is to elect Trump.</p>

## It's good to laugh

date: 2024-09-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>It's wonderful that we're laughing at Trump now.</p>
<p>What a joke to think that after all he took us through, there are 47% of the people in the country who want more of that! </p>
<p>OMG we must be crazy. What else are you going to do but laugh. </p>

## 2024-08-25 GoToSocial problems

date: 2024-09-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-25-gotosocial-problems">2024-08-25 GoToSocial problems</h1>

<p>So you&rsquo;re considering self-hosting? You heard good things about <a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial">GoToSocial</a>? I like it. I use it. This post is about the problems you should be expecting at the moment.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising, after all. This is a very prominent sentence in their README:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GoToSocial is still ALPHA SOFTWARE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what are the exact problems? Sometimes alpha software is good enough, right?</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Social_Media">#Social Media</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23GoToSocial">#GoToSocial</a></p>

<h2 id="major-annoyances">Major annoyances</h2>

<p><strong>No post editing</strong>. I hope you can handle your own typos. All you have is &ldquo;Delete and Redraft&rdquo;. But that orphans all replies, undoes all boosts, forgets all likes and removes posts from bookmarks. &ldquo;Delete and Redraft&rdquo; is a sledge hammer. &ldquo;Edit post&rdquo; is a delicate quill. And you don&rsquo;t get to have it. YOLO! (You only live once.)</p>

<p><strong>No filtering</strong>. You can mute and block and all that, but when everybody is posting about Monsterdon, the European Song Contest, the US elections, Caturday or Wordle, you can&rsquo;t filter those hashtags. You must endure the enthusiasm of the people you are following. (I think the developers are implementing things, but it does not seem to have an effect in the front-ends I use, so who knows.)</p>

<p><strong>Limited federation</strong>. This one is hard to spot. You want to follow this account and that account and it all seems to work until you go back and find that for one account, your follow request seems to hang in limbo, waiting. You cancel, and follow again. It seems to work. Come back later, back in limbo again, waiting. If you check the log, you&rsquo;ll find errors about signatures failing and what not. I have no idea. There are currently <a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+signature">8 open issues containing the word &lsquo;signature&rsquo;</a>. Something is not working and you&rsquo;ll have to have an alt (a separate account) on a different server that doesn&rsquo;t have this issue. That makes me sad. 😥</p>

<h2 id="minor-annoyances">Minor annoyances</h2>

<p><strong>No automatic post expiry</strong>. And you cannot use <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/mastodon-archive.git/">Mastodon Archive</a> because of some version number check the Python Mastodon library refuses to work.</p>

<h2 id="no-problem">No problem</h2>

<p><strong>No front-end</strong>. There is no front-end. I use apps like <a href="https://mastodon.social/@tootapp">Toot!</a> on my phone and <a href="https://semaphore.social/">Semaphore</a> on the web. I don&rsquo;t need anything fancy. And for the non-fancy options, I have <a href="https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el">mastodon.el</a> for Emacs, <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot">toot</a> for the command-line, <a href="https://tuba.geopjr.dev/">tuba</a> for Gnome, <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bitlbee-mastodon.git/">bitlbee-mastodon</a> for IRC, and so on. There are plenty of options.</p>

<p><strong>Markdown</strong> in your posts. I like my code blocks.</p>

<p><strong>SQLite</strong> on the server. It&rsquo;s currently 8.4G. The media stuff is 11G.</p>

<p><strong>Memory footprint</strong>. I use Monit to monitor processes and this process uses 185.6 MB.</p>

<p><strong>No admin</strong>. I haven&rsquo;t had to run any administration task. Not once. ❤️</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-14</strong>. <a class="account" href="https://hey.hagelb.org/@technomancy" title="@technomancy@hey.hagelb.org">@technomancy</a> wrote about his GoToSocial setup:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what&rsquo;s it like to set up your own GotoSocial server? Well, I can walk you thru what I used for my setup. Yours might be different; that&rsquo;s OK! I made these up-front choices to simplify the operational overhead because I didn&rsquo;t want this to be a hassle and I don&rsquo;t need the extra engineering that comes from trying for nine nines of uptime … It&rsquo;s fine. – <a href="https://technomancy.us/201">in which social media can be put in your own hands</a></p>

Americans began to use the term &#8220;Bourbon Democrat&#8221; in 1871 to represent those white men standing against the rights of the Black workers white southerners claimed were radical revolutionaries.

## Getting accommodations at work shouldn’t be so hard

date: 2024-09-14, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

via Universal design for work? by Meredith Farkas Unfortunately, [the ADA accommodation process is] also a dehumanizing process. This was definitely my experience with the ADA accommodations process, the stress of which then exacerbated my issues. Admitting to having needs and asking for help is hard enough without enduring intrusive self-justification. If I hadn&#8217;t already [&#8230;]

<p>Attempt 2 at assembling the changing table this afternoon. It&rsquo;s going better than attempt 1, even though the kit is missing piece 7 (it has an extra piece 17 instead), a couple of pieces clearly have the screw holes drilled into them in the wrong spot, and Gidget keeps trying to eat my wood filler 😑 But it hasn&rsquo;t broken apart catastrophically today, so I&rsquo;m counting my blessings.</p>
