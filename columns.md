## 2025-02-06 Discord for role-playing games

date: 2025-02-06, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-06-discord-for-role-playing-games">2025-02-06 Discord for role-playing games</h1>

<p>Discord really works well for my gaming. I even pay them. üò¨ And as far as finding new players goes: essentially there are some generic servers, some servers for particular games or publishers, and for your tables. So you ‚Äúlook for games‚Äù in the first two category of servers and then you send interested parties an invite to the server for your table(s).</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a bit weird but it works for me.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt use Discord as a chat or forum in the first two kinds of servers. Way too many people and crazy amount of text flying by! But on those small gaming table server? ü•∞</p>

<p>I just look the other way when they ask me about my activities shat they can share what music I listen to and what games I play. No way!</p>

<p>One thing that Discord does better than IRC is help handle the dizzying amount of channels per server (i.e. per publisher, rule set or gaming table); their specific rules; their independent admins; their roles; their selective visibility: channels for certain roles only, for certain people only, group chat (ephemeral private channels); their local bots and automations; media uploads; muting for channels and servers, for certain time periods only or until you reverse your decision. All of this is great.</p>

<p>Yes, you can self-host an IRC server and a web frontend like The Lounge (which I do) and you can get close: many channels, but all are equal: there is no formal grouping, no independent moderation, no independent roles, no independent bots. It‚Äôs all one big soup. And if you add some rules via nickserv and chanserv, it might get you all the way but is still quite arcane. What a difference Discord makes. Plus effortless voice chat. ü•∞</p>

<p>Yes, voice chat and video chat, on top of all that.</p>

<p>Now, you might think: what a shill! But really: I self-host the inferior-but-free options. I write my bot to connect to both (!) IRC and Discord and free content from the black void that is the endless Discord archives. But I also want things to just work. My time is more precious than the ‚Ç¨10 (?) I spend every month. And I had to take down Jitsi because it was too resource intensive. The alternative would have been to upgrade my lousy server and spend more time sysadminning and I don‚Äôt want to.</p>

<p>So self-hosted IRC has voice and video only if I leech Jitsi from somebody else, as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>So I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I just pay them for the service. And I look the other way when they disallow other clients. üòì</p>

<p>But then again: I used Bitlbee for a long time. I even wrote a plugin that lets you connect to your fedi instance as if it was an IRC server and another kind soul wrote a plugin that does the same for Discord. And then you start to realize how unusable this is. I‚Äôm on maybe two dozen servers? My account has access to 200+ channels, all of the active, all of them need some sort of mapping to IRC channels? It‚Äôs hell. Notifications were out of control. I stopped doing it. So: is Discord shit, or the IRC clients? I don‚Äôt know. But I know that Discord is not all bad. It‚Äôs definitely not bad as an idea of how to organize a gazillion people.</p>

<p>But I do look the other way when I think about tracking and AI training and data brokering.üñïI don‚Äôt even know if they do it but these are the days of zero trust and fucking corpo greed maggot CEOs so it doesn‚Äôt really matter what they do specifically because I don‚Äôt trust any company to do the right thing. Maybe I‚Äôd trust them if they were a non-profit association.</p>

<p>Anyway. Just putting this out there because with Discord I‚Äôm playing three or four times a week and I only don‚Äôt play more because I do want to get out every now and then. üòÜ</p>

<h2 id="reminder-to-all-feminists">Reminder to all feminists</h2>

<p>If you accept trans people being defined by their reproductive role&hellip;<br>
Then men can define all woman by their reproductive role</p>

<p>If you accept that trans teenagers are too young to make decisions about their bodies&hellip;<br>
Then men can decide teenage girls are too young to make decisions about their bodies</p>

<p>If you accept medical gatekeeping of trans people&rsquo;s access to hormones&hellip;<br>
Then doctors can restrict any woman&rsquo;s access to HRT and birth control</p>

<p>If you accept stripping trans people of legal protections&hellip;<br>
Then men can strip women of legal protections</p>

<p>This is the truth of &ldquo;trans rights are human rights&rdquo;.<br>
Regardless of your personal feelings on whether trans people are &ldquo;really&rdquo; the gender they say they are, the exact same human rights protecting us also underlie women&rsquo;s liberation&ndash; bodily autonomy, dignity, equality of opportunity, and protection from harm.<br>

## Idea for news orgs

date: 2025-02-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Do 1000 profiles of federal workers being attacked by Musk.</p>
<p>Don't use real names. Have AI provide real-looking photos of fictitious people. Explain what they do. Don't focus on their lives. Make readers think of what life will be like without them.</p>
<p>We should have done this a long time ago, when Reagan said, arrogantly, the government is the problem. </p>
<p>That should have been rebutted, strongly and regularly.</p>
<p>We need to learn what they actually do, all of them, at least understand what we're going to live without.</p>
<p>I asked ChatGPT to try it out. "I want to tell a story about a typical person who works for the US government. It shouldn't be a glamorous job, but an important one. It should improve people's lives, health, happiness, fulfillment. Pick the role at random, as well as gender, age, race, geography. Write a 100 word job description, and  provide a realistic looking profile picture. Nothing about their personal life, or actual name, but it's okay to talk about the required education and experience for the job."</p>
<p>Here's what it came back with: "An Environmental Health Officer (EHO) plays a crucial role in safeguarding public health by identifying and mitigating environmental hazards. Employed by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), EHOs conduct inspections of facilities like restaurants, swimming pools, and nursing homes to ensure compliance with health regulations. They investigate complaints related to air and water quality, noise, and waste management, and implement measures to prevent disease outbreaks. A bachelor's degree in environmental health or a related field is typically required, with many positions preferring candidates with a master's degree. Professional certification, such as Registered Environmental Health Specialist (REHS), is often preferred. Strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and the ability to communicate effectively are essential for success in this role."</p>

## The Real Upside of DeepSeek

DeepSeek, a company associated with High-Flyer, an $8 billion Chinese hedge fund, changed the AI narrative when it claimed OpenAI-like capabilities for a mere $6 million. The company challenged conventional thinking about artificial intelligence and its seemingly insatiable need for big, bad data centers and billions of dollars in infrastructure and chip investments. This is &#8230;

Regulation of cryptocurrencies was an issue in last November's US election. Molly White documented the immense sums the industry devoted to electing a <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-70/">crypto-friendly Congress</a>, and converting Trump's skepticism into enthusiasm. They had two goals, pumping the price and avoiding any regulation that would hamper them ripping off the suckers.<br />
<br />
Back in November of 2022 I added an entry to this blog's list of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/09/impossibilities.html"><i>Impossibilities</i></a> for <a href="https://datafinnovation.medium.com/the-compliance-innovation-trade-off-72b9f8026f56"><i>The Compliance-Innovation Trade-off</i></a> from the team at ChainArgos. It started:<br />
<blockquote>
<i>tl;dr: DeFi cannot be permissionless, allow arbitrary innovation and comply with any meaningful regulations. You can only choose two of those properties. If you accept a limited form of innovation you can have two-and-a-half of them.</i><br />
<br />
Fundamental results in logic and computer science impose a trade-off on any permissionless system‚Äôs ability to both permit innovation and achieve compliance with non-trivial regulations. This result depends only on long-settled concepts and the assumption a financial system must provide a logically consistent view of payments and balances to users.<br />
<br />
This is a semi-technical treatment, with more formal work proceeding elsewhere.
</blockquote>
Two years later, the "more formal work" has finally been published in a peer-reviewed Nature Publishing journal, <a href="https://www.nature.com/srep/"><i>Scientific Reports</i></a>, which claims to be the 5<sup>th</sup> most cited journal in the world. Jonathan Reiter tells me that, although the publishing process took two years, it did make the result better.<br />
<br />
Below the fold I discuss <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-84612-9"><i>Tradeoffs in automated financial regulation of decentralized finance due to limits on mutable turing machines</i></a> by Ben Charoenwong, Robert M. Kirby &amp; Jonathan Reiter.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
This team were pioneers in applying fundamental computer science theorems to blockchain-based systems, starting in April 2022 with <a href="https://datafinnovation.medium.com/the-consequences-of-scalable-blockchains-8c4d23c6af4d"><i>The Consequences of Scalable Blockchains</i></a> in which they showed that implementing an Ethereum-like system whose performance in all cases is guaranteed to be faster than any single node in the network is equivalent to solving the great unsolved problem in the theory of computation, nicknamed P vs. NP. And thus that if it were implemented, the same technique could break all current cryptography, including that underlying Ethereum.<br />
<br />
But, I believe, they were not the first. That appears to have been Tjaden Hess, River Keefer, and Emin G√ºn Sirer in <a href="https://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/28/ethereum-soft-fork-dos-vector/"><i>Ethereum's DAO Wars Soft Fork is a Potential DoS Vector</i></a> (28<sup>th</sup> June 2016), which applied the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting problem</a>" to "smart contracts" when analyzing possible defenses against DOS attacks on a "soft fork" of Ethereum proposed in response to "The DAO".<br />
<br />
Charoenwong <i>et al</i>'s abstract <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">states</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We examine which decentralized finance architectures enable meaningful regulation by combining financial and computational theory. We show via deduction that a decentralized and permissionless Turing-complete system cannot provably comply with regulations concerning anti-money laundering, know-your-client obligations, some securities restrictions and forms of exchange control. Any system that claims to follow regulations must choose either a form of permission or a less-than-Turing-complete update facility. Compliant decentralized systems can be constructed only by compromising on the richness of permissible changes. Regulatory authorities must accept new tradeoffs that limit their enforcement powers if they want to approve permissionless platforms formally. Our analysis demonstrates that the fundamental constraints of computation theory have direct implications for financial regulation. By mapping regulatory requirements onto computational models, we characterize which types of automated compliance are achievable and which are provably impossible. This framework allows us to move beyond traditional debates about regulatory effectiveness to establish concrete boundaries for automated enforcement.
</blockquote>
They summarize the fundamental problem for the automation of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">DeFi regulation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
DeFi features some computationally challenging properties: (1) Turing-complete programming, (2) permissionless access to both transact and publish code and (3) selectively immutable code. The permissionless mutability of the system combined with the Turing completeness motivates our inquiry. A system running Turing-complete code where updates can be published permissionlessly cannot make any guarantees about its future behavior, a conclusion from early work on Universal Turing Machines (UTM).
</blockquote>
Despite this, they show that if it is possible to enforce <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">less-than-Turing-complete programming</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it is possible to construct both (1) classes of algorithms that can make credible promises and (2) restricted update mechanisms that enable credible promises. In other words, DeFi platforms can provide compliant services like traditional centralized providers through fully automatic mechanisms.
</blockquote>
What exaxctly do they mean by "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">compliant</a>"?<br />
<blockquote>
Consider an economy modeled as a Turing Machine, where the machine‚Äôs state corresponds to the state of the real economy. We formalize compliance as a property of system state transitions that can be verified mechanically, following Theorem 5.8.5 of Savage.  Specifically, a compliant system is one where no sequence of permitted operations can result in a state that violates predefined regulatory constraints set by an external regulator.
</blockquote>
They translate this into <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">economic terms</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For example, if a regulation prohibits transactions with certain addresses, compliance means no sequence of permitted operations can transfer value to those addresses, either directly or indirectly. Similarly a regulator may impose requirements on intermediaries transacting in certain assets or products akin to depository receipts for those assets. Compliance would then require ensuring one does not unknowingly transact in ‚Äúproducts akin to depository receipts‚Äù for a given list of assets.
</blockquote>
Because they model regulated systems in terms of states and the transitions between them, they can apply <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">results from compputer science</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This formulation maps to well-known results in computability, such as the Halting Problem and the more general impossibility known as Rice‚Äôs Theorem: No algorithm exists to determine from the description of a [Turing Machine] whether or not the language it accepts falls into any proper subset of the recursively enumerable languages. In other words, we cannot categorize arbitrary programs into specific subsets automatically and reliably. In financial regulation, the canonical ‚Äúproper subset‚Äù is a ban on interacting with a given address: interactions involving a banned address are forbidden, and the acceptable subset of states includes no such transfers.
</blockquote>
They proceed to use cryptocurrency "mixers" as an example. They explain that Rice's Theorem means that because any general description of "mixers" defines a "proper subset" of all programs, and thus there is no automatic or reliable method by which a "smart contract" can be assessed against the general description.<br />
<br />
Of course, as Justice Potter Stewart famously said "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">I know it when I see it</a>". Human regulators will have no difficulty in recognizing a "smart contract" as a mixer, if only because in order to function it needs liquidity. To attract it the "smart contract" needs to advertise its service.  So can the regulators ban interactions with the specific addresses of the mixers they recognize? Charoenwong <i>et al</i> make <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">two arguments</a><br />
<blockquote>
First, this severely limits the regulator‚Äôs power from regulating a mutable set of protocols to only specific ones. In other words, what is often called ‚Äúprinciples-based‚Äù regulations (as opposed to rules-based regulations) are impossible. We cannot ban ‚Äúmixers‚Äù generally ‚Äì we can only ban ‚Äúmixers A, B and C.‚Äù In some sense, this is akin to banning specific means of murder rather than simply banning murder, no matter the means.
</blockquote>
Then they introduce the time element inherent in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">human regulation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Second, and more importantly, we cannot enforce even these more straightforward rules reliably. Consider these steps:<br />
<ol>
<li>Deploy a new, confusingly-coded, ‚Äúmixer‚Äù labeled X</li>
<li>Send funds to the mixer X</li>
<li>Withdraw from the mixer X and feed into the mixer A</li>
<li>Withdraw from the mixer A and feed into the mixer X</li>
<li>Withdraw from the mixer X and spend freely</li>
</ol>
This procedure works because we cannot identify arbitrary mixers, so we are free to deploy and then use them before they get put on the banned list. As a result, the regulator cannot even ban all interaction with enumerated mixers ‚Äì it can only reliably ban some forms of interaction. This result is a severe limit on regulatory power.<br />
<br />
If we consider that compliance exists in an automated form, operating on publicly available data in real-time, anyone accepting that final transfer must operate in a compliant fashion. If, instead, the plan is to decide these things later based on non-mechanical analysis, we are simply operating a conventional legal system with some more computers involved. Concretely, if that last transfer can be ruled illegal after the fact, it was never an automated financial system.
</blockquote>
This result generalizes to services other than mixers. Rice's Theorem means it isn't possible to ban a class of services, and banning individual services identified by humans will always be behind the curve.<br />
<br />
The authors illustrate the application of their result with real-world examples of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">regulatory failure</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
These case studies-The DAO, Beanstalk Finance, Compound, Terra/LUNA, and MakerDAO-collectively illustrate the practical manifestations of our paper‚Äôs theoretical findings. Each example demonstrates a different facet of the challenges in implementing reliable, automated compliance mechanisms in decentralized, Turing- complete systems. From governance attacks to stablecoin collapses and liquidation issues, these incidents underscore the impossibility of guaranteeing specific regulatory outcomes without compromising system flexibility or introducing external interventions.
</blockquote>
The authors argue that there are two ways to construct a system that does allow automated regulation, by making it permissioned rather than permissionless, or by enforcing a non-Turing-complete language for the "smart contracts". In practice many cryptocurrencies are permissioned &mdash; in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/04/decentralized-systems-arent.html"><i>Decentralized Systems Aren't</i></a> I pointed out that:<br />
<blockquote>
The fact that the coins ranked 3, 6 and 7 by "market cap" don't even claim to be decentralized shows that decentralization is irrelevant to cryptocurrency users.
</blockquote>
There are many examples of cryptocurrency systems that claim to be decentralized but are actually permissioned. Patrick Tan described one in <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/binance-built-a-blockchain-except-it-didnt-5759224ba7aa"><i>Binance Built a Blockchain, Except it Didn‚Äôt</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For all its claims of promoting decentralization, Binance runs two ‚Äúblockchains‚Äù that are not just highly centralized, but regularly alter history, undermining one of the core tenets of the blockchain ‚Äî immutability.
</blockquote>
The authors' example of a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">non-Turing-complete language</a> is:<br />

This is dangerous if we have a regulation that certain addresses cannot be paid. The issues raised surrounding the DAO hack, discussed above, apply here. But what if the only way to transfer a token is to call SendTo and that function looks like:<br />

There is no issue if a function only calls RealSendTo from SendTo. In such cases, the regulator‚Äôs responsibility is to maintain the BannedList, and the system is permissioned.
</blockquote>
Their example of a system that is not-Turing-complete is not useful, because it requires BannedList to be a constant. As they point out, if the system is to be useful, BannedList must be a variable that is updated by the regulator, and thus the system is permissioned. It may well be that, because BannedList is a variable, that the system is Turing-complete after all. I can't do the analysis to determine if this is the case, but it is known that even a small number of variables makes a system Turing-complete.<br />
<br />
Thus the paper is somewhat misleading, in the sense that it reads as if regulated systems can be either permissioned <b>or</b> not-Turing-complete, but it fails to provide an example of a system that is permissionless and not-Turing-complete. The example that looks as if it is going to be not-Turing-complete but permissionless seems to be permissioned <b>and</b> not-Turing-complete.<br />
<br />
I would argue somewhat differently:<br />
<ul>
<li>Charoenwong <i>et al</i> show that a permissionless, Turing-complete system cannot be regulated.</li>
<li>In the real world no-one is going to cripple their system by making it not-Turing-complete.</li>
<li>Even if a not-Turing-complete system could be built it isn't clear that it would be useful.</li>
<li>In essence, the regulatory act of enforcing that a system is, and remains, not-Turing-complete <i>is</i> permissioning the system.</li>
<li>Thus in practice permissionless systems cannot be regulated.</li>
</ul>

This MonoStrategy has enabled MicroStrategy to acquire <a href="https://www.mstr-tracker.com/">2.25 per cent of all bitcoin in existence</a>, a hoard worth around $46bn at current prices. The company trades at nearly double the value of its underlying bitcoin holdings, a testament to belief of some investors in Michael Saylor‚Äôs project.<br />

As long as the stock trades at a premium to its bitcoin holdings, the company can keep issuing novel securities and finding new buyers. Meanwhile, with MicroStrategy comprising a sizeable portion of crypto inflows (28 per cent in 2024, <a href="https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/uploaded-files/chrome_jnUot7ZhN1-55c34936-6e70-4def-b995-30a3c8ea2612.png">according to JPMorgan</a>), it has helped sustain bitcoin‚Äôs ascent.

a major flash crash in Ether as leveraged positions were liquidated served as a stark reminder of how digital-asset markets still lack almost all of the guardrails installed on traditional markets over the years due to various misadventures that hurt investors.

There‚Äôs no indication that any of that is likely to change anytime soon. So Sunday night‚Äôs price action in Ether ‚Äì and similar dives in a slew of other altcoins and memecoins ‚Äì serves as a reminder that for better or worse this asset class still exists far outside of the padded walls of traditional markets, regardless of how much tradfi embraces it.

## Fukuoka, Japan

date: 2025-02-06, from: mrusme blog

"Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital city of Fukuoka
Prefecture, Japan. The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has
been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long
been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among
Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. Although humans occupied the area
since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period
arrived in the Fukuoka area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato
period. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great
distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo
(Tokyo), Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has
persisted to the present."

## 2025-01-23 The bots are at it again

date: 2025-02-06, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-23-the-bots-are-at-it-again">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</h1>

<p>For a while I just appended new graphs and data to <a href="2024-11-25-emacs-china">the last post on this topic</a>.
This time around I feel it&rsquo;s worse. There are so many bots that I can&rsquo;t even do the WHOIS lookup any more.
Or perhaps I just managed to block so few that I never realized how many more there were.
In any case, now that I&rsquo;m speeding things up, there are more bots to block.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback, no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script full of firewall commands.</strong></p>

<p>It needs ipset and iptables access: <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.</p>

<p>I blocked another 4669 networks.</p>

<p>What I did was get the most recent 10000 lines from the Apache access log, filter out all the requests for my GoToSocial instance (hoping that it has good defences!?), grepping for the magic word, <a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">doing reverse lookups</a> using <code>asn.routeviews.org</code> and banning them all. Looking at a summary, there were two networks with 6 requests, 6 networks with 5 requests, etc. Of the 4669 networks banned, there were 3985 networks with a single request only.</p>

<p>That is to say, the network lookup is not really all that efficient because the requests are so incredibly diverse. There are essentially no individual IP numbers to ban because there are no repeat offenders, and even with that great ban-hammer of mine, this wouldn&rsquo;t help against the next 85% of requests because they are all unique.</p>

<p>Now, I was already banning about 10,000 networks yesterday, and their success rate is still 85%! So that tells you that even this little jousting I&rsquo;m doing is tilting at windmills because these bots are turning the web to shit.</p>

<p>Summing the numbers I see that I looked at 10,000 requests, discarded all the hits for my GoToSocial instance and still had 5560 bot hits.</p>

<p>Every website everywhere is paying the distributed price for these leeches to keep their projects running. Of course, I could rent a bigger machine, run a bigger cache, spending more money and more time for their scam.</p>

<p>I keep shouting &ldquo;CO‚ÇÇ for the CO‚ÇÇ god!&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s part of it, yes‚Ä¶ Sadly!</p>

<p>Oh, and I could not post this on fedi because my GoToSocial instance is unable to cope and takes a very long time to recover from the onslaught. While I waited, I banned another 2184 networks. And I kept doing it.</p>

<p>Fuck this shit.</p>

<p>Fuck this whole generation.</p>

<p>Time passes.</p>

<p>Let me count how many entries I added today.</p>

<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {c=0; n=0} /^# 2025-01-23/ {c=1} c&amp;&amp;/^ipset/ {n++} END {print n}' \
  bin/admin/ban-cidr
14497
</code></pre>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s about time to add some fail2ban code.
If only I knew how.
More cost they are putting on every single site operator and service provider out there.</p>

<p>Right now load is below 4, so that&rsquo;s not too bad for 2 cores.
The sites are still sluggish. I some sort of congestion issue.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-1.jpg" alt="Netstats showing connections established spiking." /></p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-01-24</strong>. What I did all day, yesterday:</p>

<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date; tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log
# count
grep ipset result.log|wc -l
# add
grep ipset result.log|sh
# document
grep ipset result.log&gt;&gt;bin/admin/ban-cidr
</code></pre>

<p>But today:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-2.jpg" alt="After midnight, load climbed up to 40 and stayed up there" /></p>

<p>I think made a mistake, yesterday around midnight. I rebooted the server and didn&rsquo;t run the script! üò±</p>

<p>I thought the packages <code>netfilter-persistent</code>, <code>iptables-persistent</code> and <code>ipset-persistent</code> took care of that but that is not the case. See below for more.</p>

<p>In any case, I think the graphs above illustrates what happens to my server without the firewall rules.</p>

<p>Grrr.</p>

<p>They said we&rsquo;re running out of IPv4 numbers but now that I&rsquo;m trying to block bots descending like flesh flies on baby bison, it turns out that there are still thousands of networks that need blocking. Holy cow may Baal eat the eyes of all the engineers partaking in this scouring of the web; may all the project managers rot and lose their teeth, their nails, their hair and their sense of smell; let them all suffer these curses until they repent, until they mend their ways and help undo the damage they are wreaking.</p>

<p><strong>Later that day</strong>. I got an email asking about the bots and so I looked at the last run.
Let&rsquo;s take the last run:</p>

<pre><code>$ head result.log
Made 763 DNS requests.
21 cache hits.
Range                          |       Hits |

</code></pre>

<p>So the three requests from this network came from just two different IP numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>38.188.60.92</li>
<li>38.188.60.70</li>
</ul>

<p>The first suspicious request is for a list of recent changes made in the last 3 days for the page &ldquo;Comments on VimMode&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s check whether this is a false positive. Perhaps the request belongs into a sequence that makes sense to a human?</p>

<pre><code>$ grep 38.188.60.92 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log.1 
/var/log/apache2/access.log:www.emacswiki.org:443 38.188.60.92 - - [24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 503 3868 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This strange request is the only request this IP number made in over 24h.</p>

<p>The only explanation I have is that the URL belongs to a dataset used to train AI, using bots running from machines rented all around the world.
Or it&rsquo;s a denial of service attack.</p>

<p><strong>2025-01-25</strong>. I think I finally understand the packages about making it all persistent:</p>

<p><code>netfilter-persistent</code> calls all the modules.</p>

<p><code>iptables-persistent</code> is the module that saves <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code> with just the rules.</p>

<p><code>ipset-persistent</code> is the module that saves <code>/etc/iptables/ipsets</code>.
This file is about 1MB and pretty much contains what <code>ban-cidr</code> contains.</p>

<p>And as it turns out, saving is never automatic.</p>

<p>You need to run <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> manually after running <code>ban-cidr</code> for all the rules and sets to be loaded on a reboot.</p>

<p>Similar stories in the news:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The AI scraper bots cause a DDoS, a distributed denial-of-service attack. At times, the AI bots would clog the lines with hundreds of IP addresses simultaneously as soon as they decided to access the site&rsquo;s content. &ndash; <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/AI-bots-paralyze-Linux-news-site-and-others-10252162.html">AI bots paralyze Linux news site and others</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-01-30</strong>. Look at this: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/ai-haters-build-tarpits-to-trap-and-trick-ai-scrapers-that-ignore-robots-txt/">AI haters‚Ä¶</a> &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t even read the whole headline of this article and I like it already.</p>

<p>The article by  Ashley Belanger for Ars Technica mentions <a class="account" href="https://tldr.nettime.org/@tante" title="@tante@tldr.nettime.org">@tante</a> and <a class="account" href="https://come-from.mad-scientist.club/@algernon" title="@algernon@come-from.mad-scientist.club">@algernon</a>, gibberish-serving (and AI-poisoning?) <a href="https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/">Nepenthes</a>, calling it malware. (Oh yeah? Oh no!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OK, so if I do nothing, AI models, they boil the planet. If I switch this on, they boil the planet. How is that my fault? &ndash; Aaron, quoted in that Ars Technica article.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like this guy.</p>

<p>If you want to read the original answers by @tante, see his blog post, <a href="https://tante.cc/2025/01/28/quoted-in-ars-technicas-article-on-tarpits-for-ai-crawlers/">Quoted in Ars Technica‚Äôs article on tarpits for AI crawlers</a>.</p>

<p>All I&rsquo;ll say is that I fear something like Nepenthes will just tie up too many resources of mine (RAM, file handles, bandwidth). &ldquo;CO‚ÇÇ for the CO‚ÇÇ god!&rdquo; But perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong? I should investigate.</p>

<p>Although <a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@wim_v12e" title="@wim_v12e@octodon.social">@wim_v12e</a> commented, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no way that something like Nephentes would ever be deployed at a scale so large that it would create considerable additional emissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For now, I keep returning a 410 &ldquo;Gone&rdquo; response to self-identified bots and I just drop packets from networks that have hosted bots at the firewall. There are probably problems with this system as packets from fediverse instances hosted by the same providers get cut off, too. And I&rsquo;m not expiring the bans, unfortunately.</p>

## How to build Ollama to run LLMs on RISC-V Linux

date: 2025-02-06, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How to build Ollama to run LLMs on RISC-V Linux</span>

            <p>RISC-V is the new entrant into the SBC/low-end desktop space, and as I'm in possession of a HiFive Premier P550 motherboard, I am running it through my usual gauntlet of benchmarks‚Äîpartly to see how fast it is, and partly to gauge how far along RISC-V support is in general across a wide swath of Linux software.</p>

<p>From my first tests on the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/risc-v-business-testing-starfives-visionfive-2-sbc">VisionFive 2 back in 2023</a> to today, RISC-V has seen quite a bit of growth, fueled by economics, geopolitical wrangling, and developer interest.</p>

<p>The P550 uses the ESWIN EIC7700X SoC, and while it doesn't have a <em>fast</em> CPU, by modern standards, it is fast enough‚Äîand the system has enough RAM and IO‚Äîto run most modern Linux-y things. Including llama.cpp and Ollama!</p>

<h2>Compiling Ollama for RISC-V Linux</h2>

<p>I'm running Ubuntu 24.04.1 on my P550 board, and when I try running Ollama's simple install script, I get:</p>

It made me wonder if any of the readers of my blog voted for Trump. I can't imagine too many did, unless they've been willing to overlook my strenuous support for any option that opposes him. However if any of you are still here, I'd like you to know that what's happening now is exactly what we thought <i>would</i> happen. If you agree that this is unacceptable, maybe we can use that as common ground to work together to get our country back from the chaotic authoritarian mess that Elon Musk is turning it into. He makes Trump look like an absolute moderate. Certainly no one who voted for Trump with any kind of appreciation for the American system, where your vote and mine matter, can stand by and not object to what he's doing to our system of government. If not now, keep this in mind as Musk's chaos becomes more and more real.

<li>You don&#8217;t have to compute gradients to break an AI system.</li>
<li>AI red teaming is not safety benchmarking.</li>
<li>Automation can help cover more of the risk landscape.</li>
<li>The human element of AI red teaming is crucial.</li>

I'm sure there will be new restraining orders from the courts telling Musk to stop, and so far Trump has been obeying those, so there's some hope when that happens he'll order Musk to stop, and then we'll find out who the boss is and how our new post-coup reality works. The shock of Trump's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo">plan for Gaza</a>, announced yesterday may get even the most "loyal" Repubs in Congress to think again about what hell they hath wrought on they country they all grew up in. I have some faith that American values are installed in their personal operating systems, somewhere in there is the remnant of the ideals of the Constitution. So I might have missed the mark, I hope I did. Meanwhile I wonder if Musk's wonderboys have managed to penetrate the military, and if they're planning on giving them orders about how to restrain the anti-Musk protests that are starting to break out around the country.

Oliver Burkeman&#8216;s latest email seems written for me, in that it sounds terrifying: The 70% rule: If you‚Äôre roughly 70% happy with a piece of writing you‚Äôve produced, you should publish it. Moving forward at 70% takes more guts, more strength of character, than holding out for 100%, because it entails moving forward amid uncertainty, [&#8230;]

## 2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server

date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-31-borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server</h1>

<p>A few days ago I mentioned the <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-01-27-rsync-sqlite">rsync-based backup script</a> I use to copy data from the server to the laptop.</p>

<p>The backup script that makes backups of my laptop (including the backup from the server) to external disks is different, however.</p>

<p>My actual backup uses external disks. I have two of them. One of them is always at the office. Every now and then (not often enough!) I make a backup to the external disk I have at hand and then I carry it to the office and bring the other one back. That is, the laptop and the two external disks are never in the same location.</p>

<p>The two external disks I use are &ldquo;known backup disks&rdquo;. When I plug them in, BorgBackup immediately starts making a backup.
I discussed this setup <a href="2017-12-24_Borg_Backup">back in 2017</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just going to repost the stuff and I don&rsquo;t think there have been any significant changes.</p>

<p>Run commands and create files as root.</p>

<p>Either use <code>sudo</code> for every command you run, or use <code>sudo su</code> once and do everything as root.
No matter how you do it, the danger zone awaits!</p>

<h2 id="mnt-backup"><code>/mnt/backup</code></h2>

<p>Create the mount point on the laptop:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/backup
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-fstab"><code>/etc/fstab</code></h2>

<p>Any disk labeled ‚ÄúBackup‚Äù will be mounted as <code>/mnt/backup</code>:</p>

<pre><code>LABEL=Backup /mnt/backup auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,noauto,x-gvfs-show 0 0
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-backups-40-backup-rules"><code>/etc/backups/40-backup.rules</code></h2>

<p>Install a symlink to this file:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/40-backup.rules \
      /etc/udev/rules.d/40-backup.rules
</code></pre>

<p>The file content:</p>

<pre><code>ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;bdi&quot;, DEVPATH==&quot;/devices/virtual/bdi/*&quot;, TAG+=&quot;systemd&quot;, ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}=&quot;automatic-backup.service&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sure that the service <code>automatic-backup</code> starts whenever an external disk gets plugged into the laptop.</p>

<h2 id="etc-backups-automatic-backup-service"><code>/etc/backups/automatic-backup.service</code></h2>

<p>Install a symlink to this file:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/automatic-backup.service \
      /etc/systemd/system/automatic-backup.service
</code></pre>

<p>The service does nothing except start the <code>run.sh</code> shell script.</p>

<pre><code>[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/backups/run.sh
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-backups-backup-disks"><code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code></h2>

<p>The <code>run.sh</code> below runs for every external disk plugged in.
It&rsquo;s important to only make backups to known backup disks, however.</p>

<p>The known backup disks are identified by their <code>uuid</code> in the <code>backup.disks</code> file.</p>

<p>To list the disk labels and their <code>uuid</code>:</p>

<pre><code>lsblk -o+uuid,label
</code></pre>

<p>Add the <code>uuid</code> to the <code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code> file.</p>

<p>This is the content of the file identifying my backup disks, for example:</p>

<pre><code># generate using: lsblk -o+uuid,label
7c478832-5d7f-43d3-9b79-20cfc67fb0e6
bb1c034e-dd21-48e7-a496-1b95685a094d
156cf4df-aa58-421e-b3d0-583fe6fdff4a
</code></pre>

<p>If you create your copy of the file, your uuids will be different!</p>

<p>When you run <code>lsblk -o+uuid,label</code> you&rsquo;ll also see the device itself. In my case, that&rsquo;s <code>/dev/sdb</code>.
Create a BorgBackup repository on the new disk, mount it, create the directory and initialize the repository.</p>

<p>When initializing the repository, you&rsquo;re asked for a passphrase. You will need it for the <code>run.sh</code> script.</p>

<pre><code>mount /dev/sdb /mnt/backup
mkdir /mnt/backup/borg-backups
borg init --encryption=repokey --progress /mnt/backup/borg-backups/backup.borg
umount /mnt/backup
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure the disk has the correct label!
You can do this from the command-line but I used <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/">Disks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="etc-backups-run-sh"><code>/etc/backups/run.sh</code></h2>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready for the actual script. It checks whether a known backup disk is mounted under <code>/mnt/backup</code> and if so, it creates a new archive in the repository.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt forget to search for <code>BORG_PASSPHRASE</code> and change it to whatever you used when you ran <code>borg init</code> above!</p>

<p>Hide the passphrase from everybody else and to make it executable:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 0700 run.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This the content of the shell script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -ue

# The udev rule is not terribly accurate and may trigger our service before
# the kernel has finished probing partitions. Sleep for a bit to ensure
# the kernel is done.
#
# This can be avoided by using a more precise udev rule, e.g. matching

<h2 id="check-the-logs">Check the logs!</h2>

<p>Check the log while the backup is being written:</p>

<p>Make sure the backup disk is identified correctly and look at the sizes of the archives. If they&rsquo;re too small, check whether the archives contain the right files!</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Backup">#Backup</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-02-04</strong>. A reader sent me an email saying: ‚Äúyou may
want to call <code>borg compact</code> after <code>borg prune</code> in order to actually free
up the disk space corresponding to the pruned archives.  Otherwise your
backup repo will keep growing in size.‚Äù</p>

<p>Good point. I think in my case it doesn‚Äôt matter because I don‚Äôt use the disk space for anything else (and surely Borg will reuse it). But who knows. Your situation might be different.</p>

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lhepyeovhk2f">The coup is over</a>. This time, unlike the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">last time</a> it was tried, it worked. We're in the post-coup world now. He showed us exactly what he would do if he could and we somehow collectively acted as if he hadn't shown us. Sanewashing was just the tip of the iceberg, you can't blame it on the press, we didn't demand they get their shit together, we didn't try to change the subject so they'd have to tell the real story. We had a lot of tools available to us that we didn't use because we are lazy and selfish. BTW, if you want to follow the power, don't look at what governments do, look at what the other oligarchs do. Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc.

As easily as Musk can turn off government websites, he can turn off our sites. He could turn off all .com or .org sites. He'll probably do it just that way. Only one domain will work in the future, x.com. Goodbye Google, Amazon, your drug store. Bubye. Not sure if moving your DNS to Europe or Asia will make a difference. He's taking advantage of centralization, and will try to make it more centralized. Totally centralized. A journalist couldn't report this, because what proof do I have? It's because there's a pattern here. And it's pretty obvious the tools he's using.

I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment on Bluesky and found that they have a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22">Suggested User List</a> that recommended the usual people who get in the way of telling the story that's really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter, people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We're living with their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them has run its course, don't you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika stickers on Teslas. That's nice. The reason you can get away with that is that you're attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course <i>publicly owned</i> now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed, so quickly.

## It's as if we got cancer

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/14/marlboroLights.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">What's happening in the US is like when a person who is a lifetime smoker gets cancer and stops smoking. You hope the cancer doesn't kill you, and swear to never smoke again if you're lucky enough to survive it.</p>
<p>We didn't appreciate how good we had it with our representative form of government. We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time, when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start trying to get their attention, which hasn't happened yet, it's going to be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not. </p>
<p>The prognosis isn't good. But we should get our shit together asap because it's our only hope. </p>
<p>PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless. Accepting your own responsibility and doing something to change it is powerful.</p>

## 2025-02-04 Degrowth

date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-04-degrowth">2025-02-04 Degrowth</h1>

<p>I posted a picture from our living room on fedi and noticed that the book <a href="https://www.celinekeller.com/who-is-afraid-of-degrowth">Who is Afraid of Degrowth</a> by C√©line Keller was visible on the coffee table.
And a bit later, <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.nz/@aimee" title="@aimee@mastodon.nz">@aimee</a> shared a link to the <a href="https://degrowth.net/">International Degrowth Network</a>, specifically to their values and principles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the heart of our movement: the values and principles of degrowth. This space explores the core ideas that drive us towards a sustainable and equitable future, from wellbeing and community to justice and care. As with any pluriversal movement, there are a wide variety of values and principles, not all of which must be fulfilled at once for something to qualify as &ldquo;degrowth&rdquo;. &ndash; <a href="https://explore.degrowth.net/degrowth/values-principles/">Values &amp; Principles: Explore degrowth</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really like the two lists. Might be useful as a checklist before doing things. There&rsquo;s more on the site, of course.</p>

## Deepfakes and the 2024 US Election

date: 2025-02-04, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem">analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections Project (<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/political-misinformation/WIRED-data.html">source</a> for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case, we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating similar content without AI.</p>
<p>We find that (1) half of AI use isn&#8217;t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em> AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions...</p></blockquote>

Women are better in general at seeing the big picture and managing accordingly. A man is more likely to hone in on one aspect of the problem and if they're good, do something brilliant, but misses out on pretty much everything else. I, as a man, have had to severely discipline myself to get anything done, because that's how I'm built. Given a chance I will always put my head down and focus on one thing until its done, then the next and the next and so on.

Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he's making it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would be if what he was doing wasn't so blatantly outrageous. We never voted for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference, thinks their own vote should count. That's going to be a massive hurdle for them to get over.

<p>It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers, Paragon&#8217;s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the alleged attacks...</p></blockquote>

I'm 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. He won't just control the US government, he will control the world economy.

## On government efficiency

date: 2025-02-02, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><tt>It‚Äôs a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.

<p>I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency. If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air), you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you‚Äôd need less taxes, and that would trickle down (more hands) as more money in people‚Äôs pockets, and you‚Äôd need less welfare (again, hands), less red tape (hands), and less bureaucracy (hands, hands, hands), et cetera.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the government should be to absorb inefficiencies.</p>
<p>As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at lowering the costs of goods and services <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and creating jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> ‚Ä¶ there are often non-economic inefficiencies that arise from rapidly scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government helps:</p>
<p><strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the bottom fund older people at the top who ‚Äúgot in first‚Äù. But you know what‚Äôs a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement plan. In our ‚ÄúBuy the latest iPhone‚Äù society, <a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Environment.</strong> The free market doesn‚Äôt nudge companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even though <a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf">electrification is 3√ó more efficient than carbon</a>, the invisible hand is taking its sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for ‚Äúonce in a lifetime‚Äù acts of God that happen every year now. The ‚Äúmore efficient‚Äù act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes, rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We pay too much for too little. We don‚Äôt pay for healthcare, we pay for insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption. And each of us ‚Äúdoing our own research‚Äù isn‚Äôt a great because you end up with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably need real doctors. And because most folks don‚Äôt need a doctor all the time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe‚Äôs law) that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.</p>
<p><strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our country. It‚Äôs probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire trained armed service members for that purpose. I‚Äôm not advocating for more military ‚ÄìI‚Äôd personally prefer less‚Äì but security is a core need and it manifests at a nation-state level.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation.</strong> I don‚Äôt think individuals should plan and build their own highways. I‚Äôd like a government to do that. I also think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form of waste? There‚Äôs no way a train makes money and is a profitable business‚Ä¶ but more trains equals less traffic. We know adding new <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.</p>
<p><strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know what‚Äôs more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That‚Äôs a joke‚Ä¶ partially. What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private schools; most parents would not do it. You‚Äôd end up with a future labor force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups, and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn‚Äôt be more efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too. You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there‚Äôs no way I can hit those numbers at home. I can‚Äôt believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only billionaires can afford it. Isn‚Äôt it nice that the government sometimes foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider‚Ä¶ these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries power innovation. The market doesn‚Äôt fund Science unless it makes money in an A/B test. We‚Äôd end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.</p>
<p><strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically, our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for cheap sources of labor. You‚Äôd have to work long hours for low pay and then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say ‚ÄúWell, you can‚Äôt work here anymore‚Äù and kick you out. Isn‚Äôt it great to have a government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn‚Äôt happen overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war about it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I could keep going, but there‚Äôs a billion and one jobs a government can do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. Old habits die hard, I guess, because I‚Äôm still thinking about efficiency‚Ä¶ but from the opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure. Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems you need data and transparency.</p>
<p>The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it‚Äôs a game. It‚Äôs a game with an enormous exploit. I‚Äôm talking Blanka in the corner levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips. Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people who already have money. Sheesh.</p>

Throughout now-president Donald Trump&#8217;s 2024 campaign, it was clear that his support was coming from three very different factions whose only shared ideology was a determination to destroy the federal government.

Saw a commercial on CNN this evening from <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/your-economic-partner">Ontario</a> in response to the tariffs, respectful, talking direct to Americans about the bonds with the people of Canada. Why can‚Äôt the Dems do this, say how important the independence of the FBI is, to start. We‚Äôd love to pay for that. Get in the game Dems.
