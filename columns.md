California Senator Adam Schiff said, I think it was yesterday, that Trump and Musk are removing honest FBI investigators and DOJ attorneys so they can raid the treasury of the United States. It's obvious, but you don't hear it said very often. It's the money they want. All of it.

## Fukuoka, Japan

date: 2025-02-06, from: mrusme blog

"Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital city of Fukuoka
Prefecture, Japan. The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has
been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long
been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among
Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. Although humans occupied the area
since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period
arrived in the Fukuoka area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato
period. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great
distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo
(Tokyo), Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has
persisted to the present."

## AIs and Robots Should Sound Robotic

<p>Most people know that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/robots">robots</a> no longer sound like tinny trash cans.

## 2025-01-23 The bots are at it again

date: 2025-02-06, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-23-the-bots-are-at-it-again">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</h1>

<p>For a while I just appended new graphs and data to <a href="2024-11-25-emacs-china">the last post on this topic</a>.
This time around I feel it&rsquo;s worse. There are so many bots that I can&rsquo;t even do the WHOIS lookup any more.
Or perhaps I just managed to block so few that I never realized how many more there were.
In any case, now that I&rsquo;m speeding things up, there are more bots to block.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback, no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script full of firewall commands.</strong></p>

<p>It needs ipset and iptables access: <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.</p>

<p>I blocked another 4669 networks.</p>

<p>What I did was get the most recent 10000 lines from the Apache access log, filter out all the requests for my GoToSocial instance (hoping that it has good defences!?), grepping for the magic word, <a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">doing reverse lookups</a> using <code>asn.routeviews.org</code> and banning them all. Looking at a summary, there were two networks with 6 requests, 6 networks with 5 requests, etc. Of the 4669 networks banned, there were 3985 networks with a single request only.</p>

<p>That is to say, the network lookup is not really all that efficient because the requests are so incredibly diverse. There are essentially no individual IP numbers to ban because there are no repeat offenders, and even with that great ban-hammer of mine, this wouldn&rsquo;t help against the next 85% of requests because they are all unique.</p>

<p>Now, I was already banning about 10,000 networks yesterday, and their success rate is still 85%! So that tells you that even this little jousting I&rsquo;m doing is tilting at windmills because these bots are turning the web to shit.</p>

<p>Summing the numbers I see that I looked at 10,000 requests, discarded all the hits for my GoToSocial instance and still had 5560 bot hits.</p>

<p>Every website everywhere is paying the distributed price for these leeches to keep their projects running. Of course, I could rent a bigger machine, run a bigger cache, spending more money and more time for their scam.</p>

<p>I keep shouting &ldquo;CO₂ for the CO₂ god!&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s part of it, yes… Sadly!</p>

<p>Oh, and I could not post this on fedi because my GoToSocial instance is unable to cope and takes a very long time to recover from the onslaught. While I waited, I banned another 2184 networks. And I kept doing it.</p>

<p>Fuck this shit.</p>

<p>Fuck this whole generation.</p>

<p>Time passes.</p>

<p>Let me count how many entries I added today.</p>

<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {c=0; n=0} /^# 2025-01-23/ {c=1} c&amp;&amp;/^ipset/ {n++} END {print n}' \
  bin/admin/ban-cidr
14497
</code></pre>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s about time to add some fail2ban code.
If only I knew how.
More cost they are putting on every single site operator and service provider out there.</p>

<p>Right now load is below 4, so that&rsquo;s not too bad for 2 cores.
The sites are still sluggish. I some sort of congestion issue.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-1.jpg" alt="Netstats showing connections established spiking." /></p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-01-24</strong>. What I did all day, yesterday:</p>

<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date; tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log
# count
grep ipset result.log|wc -l
# add
grep ipset result.log|sh
# document
grep ipset result.log&gt;&gt;bin/admin/ban-cidr
</code></pre>

<p>But today:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-2.jpg" alt="After midnight, load climbed up to 40 and stayed up there" /></p>

<p>I think made a mistake, yesterday around midnight. I rebooted the server and didn&rsquo;t run the script! 😱</p>

<p>I thought the packages <code>netfilter-persistent</code>, <code>iptables-persistent</code> and <code>ipset-persistent</code> took care of that but that is not the case. See below for more.</p>

<p>In any case, I think the graphs above illustrates what happens to my server without the firewall rules.</p>

<p>Grrr.</p>

<p>They said we&rsquo;re running out of IPv4 numbers but now that I&rsquo;m trying to block bots descending like flesh flies on baby bison, it turns out that there are still thousands of networks that need blocking. Holy cow may Baal eat the eyes of all the engineers partaking in this scouring of the web; may all the project managers rot and lose their teeth, their nails, their hair and their sense of smell; let them all suffer these curses until they repent, until they mend their ways and help undo the damage they are wreaking.</p>

<p><strong>Later that day</strong>. I got an email asking about the bots and so I looked at the last run.
Let&rsquo;s take the last run:</p>

<pre><code>$ head result.log
Made 763 DNS requests.
21 cache hits.
Range                          |       Hits |
------------------------------:|-----------:|
                       unknown |          4 |
                38.188.60.0/24 |          3 |
                201.46.36.0/22 |          3 |
                45.225.53.0/24 |          2 |
              170.246.119.0/24 |          2 |
               45.178.110.0/23 |          2 |
</code></pre>

<p>The top hitting network I blocked in the last run had made just <em>three</em> suspicious requests!</p>

<p>There is more info below:</p>

<pre><code>38.188.60.0/24
38.188.60.92 38.188.60.70 38.188.60.70
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.92 | 24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:11:58:47 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1730419325&amp;rcidonly=profh&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:12:01:02 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=2013-11-08&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.3478.83 Safari/537.36
ipset add banlist 38.188.60.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>So the three requests from this network came from just two different IP numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>38.188.60.92</li>
<li>38.188.60.70</li>
</ul>

<p>The first suspicious request is for a list of recent changes made in the last 3 days for the page &ldquo;Comments on VimMode&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s check whether this is a false positive. Perhaps the request belongs into a sequence that makes sense to a human?</p>

<pre><code>$ grep 38.188.60.92 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log.1 
/var/log/apache2/access.log:www.emacswiki.org:443 38.188.60.92 - - [24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 503 3868 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This strange request is the only request this IP number made in over 24h.</p>

<p>The only explanation I have is that the URL belongs to a dataset used to train AI, using bots running from machines rented all around the world.
Or it&rsquo;s a denial of service attack.</p>

<p><strong>2025-01-25</strong>. I think I finally understand the packages about making it all persistent:</p>

<p><code>netfilter-persistent</code> calls all the modules.</p>

<p><code>iptables-persistent</code> is the module that saves <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code> with just the rules.</p>

<p><code>ipset-persistent</code> is the module that saves <code>/etc/iptables/ipsets</code>.
This file is about 1MB and pretty much contains what <code>ban-cidr</code> contains.</p>

<p>And as it turns out, saving is never automatic.</p>

<p>You need to run <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> manually after running <code>ban-cidr</code> for all the rules and sets to be loaded on a reboot.</p>

<p>The article by  Ashley Belanger for Ars Technica mentions <a class="account" href="https://tldr.nettime.org/@tante" title="@tante@tldr.nettime.org">@tante</a> and <a class="account" href="https://come-from.mad-scientist.club/@algernon" title="@algernon@come-from.mad-scientist.club">@algernon</a>, gibberish-serving (and AI-poisoning?) <a href="https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/">Nepenthes</a>, calling it malware.

<p>I like this guy.</p>

<p>If you want to read the original answers by @tante, see his blog post, <a href="https://tante.cc/2025/01/28/quoted-in-ars-technicas-article-on-tarpits-for-ai-crawlers/">Quoted in Ars Technica’s article on tarpits for AI crawlers</a>.</p>

<p>All I&rsquo;ll say is that I fear something like Nepenthes will just tie up too many resources of mine (RAM, file handles, bandwidth). &ldquo;CO₂ for the CO₂ god!&rdquo; But perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong? I should investigate.</p>

<p>Although <a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@wim_v12e" title="@wim_v12e@octodon.social">@wim_v12e</a> commented, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no way that something like Nephentes would ever be deployed at a scale so large that it would create considerable additional emissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For now, I keep returning a 410 &ldquo;Gone&rdquo; response to self-identified bots and I just drop packets from networks that have hosted bots at the firewall. There are probably problems with this system as packets from fediverse instances hosted by the same providers get cut off, too. And I&rsquo;m not expiring the bans, unfortunately.</p>

## How to build Ollama to run LLMs on RISC-V Linux

date: 2025-02-06, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How to build Ollama to run LLMs on RISC-V Linux</span>

            <p>RISC-V is the new entrant into the SBC/low-end desktop space, and as I'm in possession of a HiFive Premier P550 motherboard, I am running it through my usual gauntlet of benchmarks—partly to see how fast it is, and partly to gauge how far along RISC-V support is in general across a wide swath of Linux software.</p>

<p>From my first tests on the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/risc-v-business-testing-starfives-visionfive-2-sbc">VisionFive 2 back in 2023</a> to today, RISC-V has seen quite a bit of growth, fueled by economics, geopolitical wrangling, and developer interest.</p>

<p>The P550 uses the ESWIN EIC7700X SoC, and while it doesn't have a <em>fast</em> CPU, by modern standards, it is fast enough—and the system has enough RAM and IO—to run most modern Linux-y things. Including llama.cpp and Ollama!</p>

<h2>Compiling Ollama for RISC-V Linux</h2>

<p>I'm running Ubuntu 24.04.1 on my P550 board, and when I try running Ollama's simple install script, I get:</p>

And btw to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/13/politics/mcconnell-remarks-trump-acquittal/index.html">Mitch McConnell</a>, fuck you. You had a chance, with one freaking vote, to avoid this. You are among a small number of people who could have stopped this. This should be the first line in your obituary. "He could have saved the United States, but chose not to do it."

It made me wonder if any of the readers of my blog voted for Trump. I can't imagine too many did, unless they've been willing to overlook my strenuous support for any option that opposes him. However if any of you are still here, I'd like you to know that what's happening now is exactly what we thought <i>would</i> happen. If you agree that this is unacceptable, maybe we can use that as common ground to work together to get our country back from the chaotic authoritarian mess that Elon Musk is turning it into. He makes Trump look like an absolute moderate. Certainly no one who voted for Trump with any kind of appreciation for the American system, where your vote and mine matter, can stand by and not object to what he's doing to our system of government. If not now, keep this in mind as Musk's chaos becomes more and more real.

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s AI Red Team just published &#8220;<a href="https://airedteamwhitepapers.blob.core.windows.net/lessonswhitepaper/MS_AIRT_Lessons_eBook.pdf">Lessons from<br />
Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Products</a>.&#8221; Their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/01/13/3-takeaways-from-red-teaming-100-generative-ai-products/">blog post</a> lists &#8220;three takeaways,&#8221; but the eight lessons in the report itself are more useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Understand what the system can do and where it is applied.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to compute gradients to break an AI system.</li>
<li>AI red teaming is not safety benchmarking.</li>
<li>Automation can help cover more of the risk landscape.</li>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/26/cuckoo.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I possibly was a bit hasty in <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/04.html#a204729">declaring the coup over</a> yesterday. I'm sure there will be new restraining orders from the courts telling Musk to stop, and so far Trump has been obeying those, so there's some hope when that happens he'll order Musk to stop, and then we'll find out who the boss is and how our new post-coup reality works. The shock of Trump's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo">plan for Gaza</a>, announced yesterday may get even the most "loyal" Repubs in Congress to think again about what hell they hath wrought on they country they all grew up in. I have some faith that American values are installed in their personal operating systems, somewhere in there is the remnant of the ideals of the Constitution. So I might have missed the mark, I hope I did. Meanwhile I wonder if Musk's wonderboys have managed to penetrate the military, and if they're planning on giving them orders about how to restrain the anti-Musk protests that are starting to break out around the country. Oh mama we live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times">interesting times</a>.

I updated the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/devs.feediverse.org">Developers account</a> on Bluesky to follow Tim Bray, Simon Willison, Techdirt, Manton Reece and Cory Doctorow. I took my feeds off the list, and added other developer accounts I regularly read. I'm trying to bootstrap something here, to see what can be done, and feel it's important to take myself out of the list for now.

## The 70% Rule

date: 2025-02-05, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Oliver Burkeman&#8216;s latest email seems written for me, in that it sounds terrifying: The 70% rule: If you’re roughly 70% happy with a piece of writing you’ve produced, you should publish it. Moving forward at 70% takes more guts, more strength of character, than holding out for 100%, because it entails moving forward amid uncertainty, [&#8230;]

## 2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server

date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-31-borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server</h1>

<p>A few days ago I mentioned the <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-01-27-rsync-sqlite">rsync-based backup script</a> I use to copy data from the server to the laptop.</p>

<p>The backup script that makes backups of my laptop (including the backup from the server) to external disks is different, however.</p>

<p>My actual backup uses external disks. I have two of them. One of them is always at the office. Every now and then (not often enough!) I make a backup to the external disk I have at hand and then I carry it to the office and bring the other one back. That is, the laptop and the two external disks are never in the same location.</p>

<p>The two external disks I use are &ldquo;known backup disks&rdquo;. When I plug them in, BorgBackup immediately starts making a backup.
I discussed this setup <a href="2017-12-24_Borg_Backup">back in 2017</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just going to repost the stuff and I don&rsquo;t think there have been any significant changes.</p>

<p>Run commands and create files as root.</p>

<p>Either use <code>sudo</code> for every command you run, or use <code>sudo su</code> once and do everything as root.
No matter how you do it, the danger zone awaits!</p>

<h2 id="mnt-backup"><code>/mnt/backup</code></h2>

<p>Create the mount point on the laptop:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/backup
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-fstab"><code>/etc/fstab</code></h2>

<p>Any disk labeled “Backup” will be mounted as <code>/mnt/backup</code>:</p>

<pre><code>LABEL=Backup /mnt/backup auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,noauto,x-gvfs-show 0 0
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-backups-40-backup-rules"><code>/etc/backups/40-backup.rules</code></h2>

<p>Install a symlink to this file:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/40-backup.rules \
      /etc/udev/rules.d/40-backup.rules
</code></pre>

<p>The file content:</p>

<pre><code>ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;bdi&quot;, DEVPATH==&quot;/devices/virtual/bdi/*&quot;, TAG+=&quot;systemd&quot;, ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}=&quot;automatic-backup.service&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sure that the service <code>automatic-backup</code> starts whenever an external disk gets plugged into the laptop.</p>

<h2 id="etc-backups-automatic-backup-service"><code>/etc/backups/automatic-backup.service</code></h2>

<p>Install a symlink to this file:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/automatic-backup.service \
      /etc/systemd/system/automatic-backup.service
</code></pre>

<p>The service does nothing except start the <code>run.sh</code> shell script.</p>

<pre><code>[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/backups/run.sh
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-backups-backup-disks"><code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code></h2>

<p>The <code>run.sh</code> below runs for every external disk plugged in.
It&rsquo;s important to only make backups to known backup disks, however.</p>

<p>The known backup disks are identified by their <code>uuid</code> in the <code>backup.disks</code> file.</p>

<p>To list the disk labels and their <code>uuid</code>:</p>

<pre><code>lsblk -o+uuid,label
</code></pre>

<p>Add the <code>uuid</code> to the <code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code> file.</p>

<p>This is the content of the file identifying my backup disks, for example:</p>

<pre><code># generate using: lsblk -o+uuid,label
7c478832-5d7f-43d3-9b79-20cfc67fb0e6
bb1c034e-dd21-48e7-a496-1b95685a094d
156cf4df-aa58-421e-b3d0-583fe6fdff4a
</code></pre>

<p>If you create your copy of the file, your uuids will be different!</p>

<p>When you run <code>lsblk -o+uuid,label</code> you&rsquo;ll also see the device itself. In my case, that&rsquo;s <code>/dev/sdb</code>.
Create a BorgBackup repository on the new disk, mount it, create the directory and initialize the repository.</p>

<p>When initializing the repository, you&rsquo;re asked for a passphrase. You will need it for the <code>run.sh</code> script.</p>

<pre><code>mount /dev/sdb /mnt/backup
mkdir /mnt/backup/borg-backups
borg init --encryption=repokey --progress /mnt/backup/borg-backups/backup.borg
umount /mnt/backup
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure the disk has the correct label!
You can do this from the command-line but I used <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/">Disks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="etc-backups-run-sh"><code>/etc/backups/run.sh</code></h2>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready for the actual script. It checks whether a known backup disk is mounted under <code>/mnt/backup</code> and if so, it creates a new archive in the repository.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to search for <code>BORG_PASSPHRASE</code> and change it to whatever you used when you ran <code>borg init</code> above!</p>

<p>Hide the passphrase from everybody else and to make it executable:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 0700 run.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This the content of the shell script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -ue

# The udev rule is not terribly accurate and may trigger our service before
# the kernel has finished probing partitions. Sleep for a bit to ensure
# the kernel is done.

<p><strong>2025-02-04</strong>. A reader sent me an email saying: “you may
want to call <code>borg compact</code> after <code>borg prune</code> in order to actually free
up the disk space corresponding to the pruned archives.  Otherwise your
backup repo will keep growing in size.”</p>

<p>Good point. I think in my case it doesn’t matter because I don’t use the disk space for anything else (and surely Borg will reuse it). But who knows. Your situation might be different.</p>

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lhepyeovhk2f">The coup is over</a>. This time, unlike the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">last time</a> it was tried, it worked. We're in the post-coup world now. He showed us exactly what he would do if he could and we somehow collectively acted as if he hadn't shown us. Sanewashing was just the tip of the iceberg, you can't blame it on the press, we didn't demand they get their shit together, we didn't try to change the subject so they'd have to tell the real story. We had a lot of tools available to us that we didn't use because we are lazy and selfish. BTW, if you want to follow the power, don't look at what governments do, look at what the other oligarchs do. Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc.

As easily as Musk can turn off government websites, he can turn off our sites. He could turn off all .com or .org sites. He'll probably do it just that way. Only one domain will work in the future, x.com. Goodbye Google, Amazon, your drug store. Bubye. Not sure if moving your DNS to Europe or Asia will make a difference. He's taking advantage of centralization, and will try to make it more centralized. Totally centralized. A journalist couldn't report this, because what proof do I have? It's because there's a pattern here. And it's pretty obvious the tools he's using.

I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment on Bluesky and found that they have a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22">Suggested User List</a> that recommended the usual people who get in the way of telling the story that's really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter, people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We're living with their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them has run its course, don't you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika stickers on Teslas. That's nice. The reason you can get away with that is that you're attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course <i>publicly owned</i> now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed, so quickly.

## It's as if we got cancer

You hope the cancer doesn't kill you, and swear to never smoke again if you're lucky enough to survive it.</p>
<p>We didn't appreciate how good we had it with our representative form of government. We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time, when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start trying to get their attention, which hasn't happened yet, it's going to be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not. </p>
<p>The prognosis isn't good. But we should get our shit together asap because it's our only hope. </p>
<p>PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless. Accepting your own responsibility and doing something to change it is powerful.</p>

## 2025-02-04 Degrowth

date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-04-degrowth">2025-02-04 Degrowth</h1>

<p>I posted a picture from our living room on fedi and noticed that the book <a href="https://www.celinekeller.com/who-is-afraid-of-degrowth">Who is Afraid of Degrowth</a> by Céline Keller was visible on the coffee table.
And a bit later, <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.nz/@aimee" title="@aimee@mastodon.nz">@aimee</a> shared a link to the <a href="https://degrowth.net/">International Degrowth Network</a>, specifically to their values and principles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the heart of our movement: the values and principles of degrowth. This space explores the core ideas that drive us towards a sustainable and equitable future, from wellbeing and community to justice and care. As with any pluriversal movement, there are a wide variety of values and principles, not all of which must be fulfilled at once for something to qualify as &ldquo;degrowth&rdquo;. &ndash; <a href="https://explore.degrowth.net/degrowth/values-principles/">Values &amp; Principles: Explore degrowth</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really like the two lists. Might be useful as a checklist before doing things. There&rsquo;s more on the site, of course.</p>

<p>Values of Degrowth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Autonomy &amp; Democracy</li>
<li>Care</li>
<li>Justice</li>
<li>Sustainability &amp; Sufficiency</li>
<li>Well-being</li>
<li>Sovereignty</li>
<li>Community</li>
</ul>

<p>Principles of degrowth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resource sovereignty: Be a steward of nature</li>
<li>Embracing the Pluriverse: Celebrate a world of many worlds</li>
<li>Circularity: Waste not, want not</li>
<li>Socially useful production: What is not needed should not be made</li>
<li>Decolonising Futures: Unlearn, relearn, and heal</li>
<li>Small, not-for-profit cooperatives: People and planet, not profit</li>
<li>Proximity &amp; Cosmolocalism: Produce local, design global</li>
<li>Creative Visions: Art as a catalyst for change</li>
<li>Convivial tools: Technology as a tool, not a master</li>
<li>Healing Histories: Making amends for past wrongs</li>
<li>Postwork: Work less, play more</li>
<li>Active Change: Stand up, speak out</li>
<li>Value sovereignty: What matters most</li>
<li>Health: Well-being for All</li>
<li>Commons: Decide together</li>
<li>Reconnecting with Spirit: Rediscovering our bonds with the sacred</li>
<li>Sharing: Sufficiency for all, overabundance for none</li>
<li>Feminist Futures: Centering equality</li>
<li>Relational goods: Less stuff, more relationships</li>
<li>Transformative Learning: Empowering collective action</li>
<li>Joie de vivre: If I can&rsquo;t dance, I don&rsquo;t want to be part of your economy</li>

## Deepfakes and the 2024 US Election

date: 2025-02-04, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem">analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections Project (<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/political-misinformation/WIRED-data.html">source</a> for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case, we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating similar content without AI.</p>
<p>We find that (1) half of AI use isn&#8217;t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em> AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions...</p></blockquote>

A man is more likely to hone in on one aspect of the problem and if they're good, do something brilliant, but misses out on pretty much everything else. I, as a man, have had to severely discipline myself to get anything done, because that's how I'm built. Given a chance I will always put my head down and focus on one thing until its done, then the next and the next and so on.

Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he's making it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would be if what he was doing wasn't so blatantly outrageous. We never voted for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference, thinks their own vote should count. That's going to be a massive hurdle for them to get over.

## Journalists and Civil Society Members Using WhatsApp Targeted by Paragon Spyware

<p>This is yet another story of commercial spyware being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware">used against</a> journalists and civil society members.</p>
<blockquote><p>The journalists and other civil society members were being alerted of a possible breach of their devices, with WhatsApp telling the Guardian it had &#8220;high confidence&#8221; that the 90 users in question had been targeted and &#8220;possibly compromised.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers, Paragon&#8217;s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the alleged attacks...</p></blockquote>

I'm 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. He won't just control the US government, he will control the world economy.

## On government efficiency

date: 2025-02-02, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><tt>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt></p>
<p>I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency. If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air), you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you’d need less taxes, and that would trickle down (more hands) as more money in people’s pockets, and you’d need less welfare (again, hands), less red tape (hands), and less bureaucracy (hands, hands, hands), et cetera.</p>
<p>I’ve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the government should be to absorb inefficiencies.</p>
<p>As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at lowering the costs of goods and services <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and creating jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> … there are often non-economic inefficiencies that arise from rapidly scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.</p>
<p>Here’s a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government helps:</p>
<p><strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the bottom fund older people at the top who “got in first”. But you know what’s a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement plan. In our “Buy the latest iPhone” society, <a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Environment.</strong> The free market doesn’t nudge companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even though <a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf">electrification is 3× more efficient than carbon</a>, the invisible hand is taking its sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for “once in a lifetime” acts of God that happen every year now. The “more efficient” act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes, rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We pay too much for too little. We don’t pay for healthcare, we pay for insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption. And each of us “doing our own research” isn’t a great because you end up with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably need real doctors. And because most folks don’t need a doctor all the time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe’s law) that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.</p>
<p><strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our country. It’s probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire trained armed service members for that purpose. I’m not advocating for more military –I’d personally prefer less– but security is a core need and it manifests at a nation-state level.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation.</strong> I don’t think individuals should plan and build their own highways. I’d like a government to do that. I also think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form of waste? There’s no way a train makes money and is a profitable business… but more trains equals less traffic. We know adding new <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.</p>
<p><strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know what’s more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That’s a joke… partially. What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private schools; most parents would not do it. You’d end up with a future labor force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups, and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn’t be more efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too. You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there’s no way I can hit those numbers at home. I can’t believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only billionaires can afford it. Isn’t it nice that the government sometimes foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider… these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries power innovation. The market doesn’t fund Science unless it makes money in an A/B test. We’d end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.</p>
<p><strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically, our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for cheap sources of labor. You’d have to work long hours for low pay and then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say “Well, you can’t work here anymore” and kick you out. Isn’t it great to have a government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn’t happen overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war about it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I could keep going, but there’s a billion and one jobs a government can do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. Old habits die hard, I guess, because I’m still thinking about efficiency… but from the opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure. Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems you need data and transparency.</p>
<p>The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it’s a game. It’s a game with an enormous exploit. I’m talking Blanka in the corner levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips. Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people who already have money. Sheesh.</p>
