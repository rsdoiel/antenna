**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Is this the <a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1800879295063003367">user experience</a> writers want from WordPress? If I were designing it, I would start from scratch, build an easy writing tool for writers to focus on writing, and make the design process accessible if they want to work in that mode, but keep it out of their way because most writing has nothing to do with design.

## Using AI for Political Polling

date: 2024-06-12, updated: 2024-06-11, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Public polling is a critical function of modern political campaigns and movements, but it isn&#8217;t what it once was. Recent US election cycles have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/polling-catastrophe/616986/">produced</a> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/">copious</a> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2021/03/02/what-2020s-election-poll-errors-tell-us-about-the-accuracy-of-issue-polling/#:~:text=Most%20preelection%20polls%20in%202020,close%20when%20it%20was%20not.">postmortems</a> explaining both the successes and the flaws of public polling. There are two main reasons polling fails.</p>
<p>First, nonresponse has skyrocketed. It&#8217;s radically harder to reach people than it used to be. Few people fill out surveys that come in the mail anymore. Few people answer their phone when a stranger calls. Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/02/27/response-rates-in-telephone-surveys-have-resumed-their-decline/">reported</a> that 36% of the people they called in 1997 would talk to them, but only 6% by 2018. Pollsters worldwide have faced similar challenges...</p>

## Office Hours: Tomorrow’s big election

date: 2024-06-12, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, Tomorrow, Tesla shareholders vote on whether to give Elon Musk a bonus worth about $50 billion. That&#8217;s roughly what Congress appropriated for Ukraine earlier this year after months of legislative and political negotiation. The Delaware Chancery court has found that the bonus is excessive and wasn&#8217;t the product of negotiation between Tesla and Musk.

## Eating bitter

date: 2024-06-12, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

One virtue of eating bitter, I think, is that it helps you learn the taste and sensation of helpful bitterness, and how to tell it apart from the bitterness that breaks you down, or poisons you.

&#8220;We&#8217;re producing more energy than ever before in this nation. We have the strongest economy in the world, and we are beating China for the first time in decades. More people went to work this morning in America than at any other time in our nation&#8217;s history. So I&#8217;ve got a message to Donald Trump and all his negativity and his whining: Stop sh*t talking America. This is the greatest country on earth, and it&#8217;s time that we all start acting like it.&#8221;

## Why Apple Should Support National Parks

date: 2024-06-11, from: Om Malik blog

I attended Apple’s WWDC event yesterday. When the new macOS Sequoia was announced, I tweeted the following: “I think Apple and Tim_cook should donate $1 per copy of Mac OS copies shipped (downloaded) towards the preservation of a California location they use as code name for the MacOS. Start with Sequoia. Save out parks, monuments. &#8230;

## Right-margin images

<p>Then it occurred to me, I have the perfect place for these images, outside the facebookiverse, that would showcase them, and be easy to produce (I don't want to take on responsibility for big production overhead myself).</p>
<p>I have images I put in the right margin of blog posts on <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. Small little bits of creative color, that may or may not be connected to the story they are next to. And sometimes connected in non-obvious ways, intended to make you think.</p>
<p>Then NakedJen sent me a recent picture of herself that's perfect for the right margin. Seen in the right margin of this post.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/manyImages.html">page</a> where you can scroll through the collection of images I can choose from. I'd love to add more creative stuff here. And I'd love to get some of Stan Krute's genius or Brad Pettit or whoever else might be so inspired. </p>
<p>No promises about when or if they'd be used. You can post them here, as comments on this message if you like. </p>
<p>I may have to restrict this to people I follow, just letting you know, based on past experience. </p>

I have written fairly often about the problems of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search/label/games">preserving video games</a>, most recently last year in in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/08/video-game-history.html"><i>Video Game History</i></a>. It was based upon Phil Salvador's <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996492"><i>Survey of the Video Game Reissue Market in the United States</i></a>. Salvador's main focus was on classic console games but he noted a specific problem with <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996492">more recent releases</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The largest major platform shutdown in recent memory is the closure of the digital stores for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U platforms. Nintendo shut down the 3DS and Wii U eShops on March 27, 2023, resulting in the removal of 2,413 digital titles. Although many of these are likely available on other platforms, Video Games Chronicle estimates that over 1,000 of those games were exclusive to those platforms’ digital stores and are no longer available in any form, including first-party Nintendo titles like Dr. Luigi, Dillon’s Rolling Western, Mario &amp; Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, and Pokémon Rumble U. The closures also affected around 500 historical games reissued by Nintendo through their Virtual Console storefronts, over 300 of which are believed not available on any other platform or service. 
</blockquote>
Below the fold I discuss recent developments in this area.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Salvador <a a="" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996492">writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Games released during the digital game distribution era may have content or features tied to online services, which may be (and regularly are) deactivated. According to researcher James Newman, this is sometimes employed by game publishers as a deliberate strategy to devalue used games, shorten their distribution window, and encourage sales of new titles, which has ominous implications for preservation.
</blockquote>
This post started with Timothy Geigner's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/04/08/one-youtubers-quest-for-political-action-to-preserve-old-video-games/"><i>One YouTuber’s Quest For Political Action To Preserve Old Video Games</i></a>. He lays out the problem:<br />
<blockquote>
it’s probably long past time that there be some sort of political action to address the real or potential disappearance of cultural output that is occurring. The way this works far too often is that a publisher releases a game that is either an entirely online game, or an offline game that requires backend server calls or connections to make it work. People by those games. Then, some time down the road, the publisher decides supporting the game is no longer profitable and shuts the servers down on its end, disappearing the purchased game either completely, or else limiting what was previously available. Those that bought or subscribed to the game are left with no options.
</blockquote>
The trigger for renewed attention to this problem was Ubisoft's April 1<sup>st</sup>(!) <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/04/08/one-youtubers-quest-for-political-action-to-preserve-old-video-games/">delisting of <i>The Crew</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
With <i>The Crew</i>, millions of copies of the game were played around the world. When Ubisoft delisted the game late last year, the game became unplayable. On top of that, because of copyright law, it would be illegal for fans to keep the game alive themselves by running their own servers, even assuming they had the source code necessary to do so. So fans of the game who still want to play it are stuck.
</blockquote>
Kenneth Shephard reported in <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-the-crew-accursed-farms-stop-killing-games-1851385068"><i>A Ubisoft Game Is At The Center Of A Fight To Stop Online Game Shutdowns</i></a> that this triggered an effort to respond:<br />
<blockquote>
Ross Scott, who runs Accursed Farms, posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE">31-minute video</a> on the channel, which outlines the problem and how he believes drawing attention to <i>The Crew</i>’s April 1 <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-crew-delisted-ubisoft-servers-xbox-pc-ps4-1851101053">shutdown</a> could cause governments to enact greater consumer protections for people who purchase online games. As laid out in the video, consumer rights for these situations vary in different countries. France, however, has some pretty robust consumer laws, and Ubisoft is based there.
</blockquote>
Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE">Scott's video</a>:<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w70Xc9CStoE" width="320" youtube-src-id="w70Xc9CStoE"></iframe></div>
Scott surveyed countries around the world looking for the prospects of two possible actions:<br />
<ul>
<li>Lobbying the country's consumer protection agency to take action on the grounds that the company purported to sell the game but failed to make it clear that the game could be rendered useless at any time without warning or compensation.</li>
<li>Petitioning the government to take legal or legislative action against this practice.</li>
</ul>
These actions would be aimed at ensuring that after a vendor's support for a game it sold ended:<br />
<ul>
<li>Games sold must be left in a functional state.</li>
<li>Games sold must require no further connection to the publisher or affiliated parties to function.</li>
<li>The above also applies to games that have sold microtransactions to customers.</li>
<li>The above cannot be superseded by end user license agreements.</li>
</ul>
These appear to match Scott's goal of a minimal set of consumer rights that is hard to argue against. If the game publishers can't live with them they can always explicitly rent the game instead of selling it. Renting makes it clear that the purchaser's rights are time-limited.<br />
<br />
More details of the campaign can be found at Scott's <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/"><i>Stop Killing Games</i></a> website. Scott has so far posted three update videos to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms"><i>Accursed Farms</i></a> YouTube channel:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jezi1bE4xvc"><i>April updates on campaign to stop game destruction</i></a>: The UK petition hit 10K signatures almost immediately, enough to get an answer from the government. The Australian petition's wording got messed up so it applies to ALL software, too big an ask. The German consumer protection agency is aware of the shutdown of <i>The Crew</i>, and misbehavior by other publishers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVGZe-xXS68"><i>Dead Games News: Response from UK Government</i></a>: The UK government responded, but the Parliamentary Petitions Committee decided that the response didn't address the petition, and has asked for a revised response.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXts7rj4cSk"><i>May updates on campaign to stop game destruction</i></a>: It looks as if in the UK if a game you bought shuts down within three years you can complain to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority">Competition and Markets Authority</a> on the basis that at the time of purchase you were not informed of the lifetime of the game.</li>
</ul>
The idea that purchasers are entitled to be told at least the minimum lifetime of the gane is interesting. Ubisoft's excuse for delisting <i>The Crew</i> was that their licenses to music and other content featured in the game had expired. But that implies that, at launch, they knew that they would delist the game at the date when their licenses were due to expire. To make an informed purchase decision customers needed to know that date. Not providing it on the box was clearly deceptive.<br />
<br />
Publishers would <i>hate</i> a requirement to put a "playable until" date on the box; it would clearly reduce purchases. They might find Scott's requirements less onerous.<br />
<br />

By popular demand -- my blogroll now makes it more clear that the permalink to each item is the date of the item. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/blogrollScreenShot.png">Screen shot</a>. This is a convention in blogs and social media apps that the timestamp doubles as a permalink. And I think this is more distracting, and cluttered, but let's give it a try. It's possible that people missed that they could go to the website from the blogroll. Now it should be more obvious.

Their slogan might as well be Revenge. It's the one thing everyone who votes for Trump wants more than anything. They hate their lives, and are looking for someone to release their rage on. They don't know how else to do it. It doesn't have much to do with inflation or unemployment, material wealth. It's deeper than that. We're all living a lie, that if we had money we'd be happy. The sad truth is no one is happy with this arrangement. Ask a billionaire if you don't believe me. They have huge grievances which you would have thought all that wealth would have cured them of. The new Nazis have a selling proposition that works every few generations, after the memory of the previous societal explosion are gone. My parents, the last people I knew who lived through the Nazis are gone. I just have the memory of the aftermath, and it wasn't pretty. “All of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.” We're at the beginning of the "happen again" moment. My grandfather told me what to do, but I won't do it, pretty sure of that.

## LLMs Acting Deceptively

date: 2024-06-11, updated: 2024-06-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>New research: &#8220;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2317967121">Deception abilities emerged in large language models</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Large language models (LLMs) are currently at the forefront of intertwining AI systems with human communication and everyday life. Thus, aligning them with human values is of great importance. However, given the steady increase in reasoning abilities, future LLMs are under suspicion of becoming able to deceive human operators and utilizing this ability to bypass monitoring efforts. As a prerequisite to this, LLMs need to possess a conceptual understanding of deception strategies. This study reveals that such strategies emerged in state-of-the-art LLMs, but were nonexistent in earlier LLMs. We conduct a series of experiments showing that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to understand and induce false beliefs in other agents, that their performance in complex deception scenarios can be amplified utilizing chain-of-thought reasoning, and that eliciting Machiavellianism in LLMs can trigger misaligned deceptive behavior. GPT-4, for instance, exhibits deceptive behavior in simple test scenarios 99.16% of the time (P &#60; 0.001). In complex second-order deception test scenarios where the aim is to mislead someone who expects to be deceived, GPT-4 resorts to deceptive behavior 71.46% of the time (P &#60; 0.001) when augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning. In sum, revealing hitherto unknown machine behavior in LLMs, our study contributes to the nascent field of machine psychology...</p></blockquote>

## Why curl closes PRs on GitHub

date: 2024-06-11, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

Contributors to the curl project on GitHub tend to notice the above sequence quite quickly: pull requests submitted do not generally appear as &#8220;merged&#8221; with its accompanying purple blob, instead they are said to be &#8220;closed&#8221;. This has been happening since 2015 and is probably not going to change anytime soon.

## How do my phone, dSLR, and point and shoot cameras compare?

I recently found my old point and shoot digital camera. I thought it would be fun to do a photo-to-photo comparison of my cell phone, dSLR with a nice lens, and twenty year old digital camera. What have 16 years of camera processing development bought us? The cameras Google Pixel 6a 12.2 megapixels released 2022 [&#8230;]

Former president Trump met with a New York City probation officer today for a pre-sentencing interview. They met over video for a first step in the sentencing process, in which an officer assesses the convicted criminal&#8217;s living situation, finances, mental health, addiction, and criminal record. Trump was expected to have his lawyer, Todd Blanche, with him when he linked in from Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. Judge Juan Merchan will take the information from the interview into account when he sentences Trump. He will also consider that Trump was held in contempt 10 times during the trial for violating the gag order designed to stop him from attacking witnesses and court personnel and their families.

And before that a few oddly empowered crazy-ass people at Netscape had an idea that bloggers had the answer, not Google. I don't really know who they were, they communicated through their actions, not via email or the phone. Same kind of thing happened with XML-RPC, except there I knew the people at Microsoft who momentarily bent the corporate rules to make something happen quickly and simply in the market.

The real story of RSS is that in a moment when the NYT had a spirit of adventure, they backed RSS and as a result news adopted a technology that was pioneered by bloggers, not the tech industry. If that partnership had flourished and developed we might now have a good alternative to the tech billionaires.

## Exploiting Mistyped URLs

date: 2024-06-10, updated: 2024-06-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645510">Hyperlink Hijacking: Exploiting Erroneous URL Links to Phantom Domains</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Web users often follow hyperlinks hastily, expecting them to be correctly programmed. However, it is possible those links contain typos or other mistakes. By discovering active but erroneous hyperlinks, a malicious actor can spoof a website or service, impersonating the expected content and phishing private information. In &#8220;typosquatting,&#8221; misspellings of common domains are registered to exploit errors when users mistype a web address. Yet, no prior research has been dedicated to situations where the linking errors of web publishers (i.e. developers and content contributors) propagate to users. We hypothesize that these &#8220;hijackable hyperlinks&#8221; exist in large quantities with the potential to generate substantial traffic. Analyzing large-scale crawls of the web using high-performance computing, we show the web currently contains active links to more than 572,000 dot-com domains that have never been registered, what we term &#8216;phantom domains.&#8217; Registering 51 of these, we see 88% of phantom domains exceeding the traffic of a control domain, with up to 10 times more visits. Our analysis shows that these links exist due to 17 common publisher error modes, with the phantom domains they point to free for anyone to purchase and exploit for under 20, representing a low barrier to entry for potential attackers...</p></blockquote>

Yesterday the Washington Post published an article by Beth Reinhard examining the philosophy and the power of Russell Vought, the hard-right Christian nationalist who is drafting plans for a second Trump term. Vought was the director of the Office of Management and Budget from July 2020 to January 2021 during the Trump administration. In January 2021 he founded the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank, and he was a key player in the construction of Project 2025, the plan to gut the nonpartisan federal government and replace it with a dominant president and a team of loyalists who will impose religious rule on the United States.

## Wikipedia vs ChatGPT

date: 2024-06-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>I started replying to a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746">post by Tim Bray</a> in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character limit, so I moved my act over here. </i></p>
<p>ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia. </p>
<p>It often only represents a story from one point of view.</p>
<p>So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.</p>
<p>Same with the story of RSS. I'm sure you know the story they tell, but there's a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and  Motley Fool, and eventually brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you'd get the idea that the bigco's heroically fought back against what exactly it's not clear. </p>
<p>I can't contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well it's not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it on my blog (as I'm doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is. (Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)</p>
<p>Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT made a mistake like that people would be howling. I'm sure Wikipedia is filled with junk like that. Why wouldn't it be. </p>
<p>And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while other sources don't. </p>
<p>But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles. </p>
<p>ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the open web. I don't know why it's better at finding stuff, and also understanding my queries even though they're not rigorously specified, my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.</p>
<p>It's also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which of course they are being. </p>
<p>Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that's a big difference between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very impatient with them and move on. </p>
<p>Also, I'm not here to debate. I don't like online debates. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me find the big stuff. I don't know when this app came to be, but it's very helpful.  In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device that's ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems). I'm sure there's a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on the 16TB external drive, but I sure don't know how to do it nor do I want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a lot longer than this Mac's has. I desperately want to move my act to Linux and reclaim all the memory I'm using to store stuff about the Mac, which isn't really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that's my revenge, and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would make <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups">beaucoups</a> money, so I hedged. I figured at least they'd make me rich while completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen Apple keep <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> running and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as usual I ramble. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
