## It was real

date: 2025-08-03, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

I grew up under the red star, and right now I&#8217;m just to the right of it, on the third and top floor of the smallest residential building in northern Manhattan. When it hit, my wife and I both said, &#8220;That&#8217;s an earthquake.&#8221; We&#8217;ve experienced many in California, and know the feel. But none of [&#8230;]

It would tell stories that I would likely tell, take political stands that I would take, draw meta-pictures of my sad and depressed <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/09/202442.html">programmer friend</a> and a cute and <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22wordle%20kitty%22">adorable kitty</a> getting into all kinds of trouble.

## ★ The Substack Branding and Faux Prestige Trap

date: 2025-08-02, updated: 2025-08-03, from: Daring Fireball

Only with Substack does anyone perceive creator branding as being subservient to the platform — something that ought to be seen merely as an interchangeable CMS.

## 2025-08-02 Üetliberg

date: 2025-08-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-08-02-üetliberg">2025-08-02 Üetliberg</h1>

<p>Today the weather was cloudy and the rain was drizzling for hours.
We went for a walk up the Üetliberg.
We picked a safe trail with official signage.</p>

<p>This small mountain is our local mountain here in Zürich and there’s a train that goes almost all the way to the top.
These days it doesn’t run because there are maintenance works taking apart the tracks.
We thought it’d be calm up there.
We were wrong.
There are buses running. There was a wedding at the posh hotel and restaurant at the top.</p>

<p>When going for a walk on the Üetliberg in Zürich, do take a look from the top (Uto Kulm) and look over the lake towards the Alps.
But today we learned: If you want to eat something, don&rsquo;t eat at the posh place up there, walk 20 min and stop at <a href="https://jurablick.com/">Jurablick</a>, looking north towards the Jura mountains.
We ate a shepherd’s pie, a caponata, some chestnut cake and some poppy seed cake.
Tasty!
And everybody was super nice.</p>

<p>Too bad the Einbeere (Paris quadrifolia) was out of focus.
The fruit looks uncanningly similar, but it grows on a single stalk atop four leaves at right angles to each other.</p>

@manton is offering free blog hosting for teachers &#38; nurses on micro.blog. Micro blog is fully featured, should be especially interesting to teachers who want to own the content they share on social media. Micro.blogs cross posting is peerless. Of course for Scot&#8217;s teachers I&#8217;d recommend Glow.

## A fiscal recalibration

date: 2025-08-02, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>After all our summer trips I buckled down last weekend and did some budgetting and I’ve realized I have to update the spreadsheet in my head. Here’s how much things cost in my outdated DaveBrain 2000 operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast food -$5/person = $20/family</li>
<li>Snacks - $2.50/person = $10/family</li>
</ul>
<p>That –as my bank account is telling me– is super incorrect. The real numbers are much more like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast food - $12.50~$15/person = $50~$60/family</li>
<li>Snacks  - $5~$7.50/person = $20~$30/family</li>
</ul>
<p>And groceries have gone up too. Woof. Hard times in the concrete jungle.</p>
<p>We’re updating the database and cutting back on these obvious financial vampires. And we know when/why we tend to rely on them to get us through the week. So that’s good. But when you have kids –snack-reliant kids at that– introducing austerity measures like this is hard, because being a penny-pinching dick about money all the time probably isn’t good for them either.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about me though. I’m lucky to have a great job and two kidneys, I’m sure I can sell one of them for a decent amount.</p>
<p>Namaste.</p>

## Getting Real With AI.

date: 2025-08-02, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

When I read that some conversations with ChatGPT had appeared in Google searches, I did a search for &#8220;Doc Searls&#8221; ChatGPT and got a long and not-bad but not entirely accurate AI summary below which normal-ish search results appeared. When I went back later to do the same search, the results were different. I tried [&#8230;]

## The Economy? He died five years ago.

date: 2025-08-01, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I hold a conspiracy theory <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Rb3Wh6YDeAU">the global economy died five years ago during Covid</a>. It’s been on life support through stimulus checks and flash tech hype cycles ever since trying to keep the dormant heart beating. You sense it too. There’s no beating heart. There’s no thumping energy. No vein of excitement. Tech and knowledge work seems to be suffering the most.</p>
<p>The death of the Economy started long before Covid if I’m honest. Since the iPhone it feels like everyone has been waiting for the next big hit, the next new shiny, the next money-maker. It’s like an endless distracted boyfriend meme looping year over year. And I regret to inform you that the investors are at it again. Today it’s LLMs, before that crypto and the Web3 Metaverse, before that VR, before that the gig economy, before that smartwatches, before that smart-homes, before that 3D televisions, before that…</p>
<p>The phalanx of tech billionaires behind Trump at the inauguration is an image seared into my memory and it’s taught me a lot. It taught me that these companies are desperate. Desperate to win favor. Desperate to avoid regulation. Desperate to keep their government contracts. Because without the preferential treatment, the lawlessness, and the humongous contracts, they’re financially and morally bankrupt.</p>
<p>(To be fair –why do I feel the need to be fair to tech billionaires!?– from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_doctrine">Friedman doctrine</a> perspective their job is to create value for stakeholders. Kissing the ring of the petty, easily-aggrieved, fascist, man-baby tyrant is probably the most surefire way to avoid unwanted scrutiny in uncertain fiscal times. I understand that part of their job. But I’d wager the long-term outcome will be that they set themselves up for future embarrassment, exploitation, and extortion while simultaneously selling out all the immigrants, queer people, and furries who keep their empires running on a daily basis.)</p>
<p>That scene in the rotunda reinforced my belief the economy was already dead. If Big Tech is clinging to government contracts and quid pro quo perks, then we must be out of ideas. Every time the winds of fortune change, everyone points their boats in the same direction. In a healthy, living economy shouldn’t there be more than one lake to fish in? Instead of asking “What doesn’t exist and would be useful?” and investing in that, it’s about “How can I extract the most money from hot new tech?” Instead of “What’s quality?” and chasing that, it’s “How can we move fast and make breakable things?”</p>
<p>An aside: What if there are no new ideas? What if the internet accelerated knowledge sharing to the point we’ve made all the software and we’re literally out of ideas!? There are no more worlds left to conquer, Alexander! Help!</p>
<p>I doubt that though. I bet there’s good ideas out there. I bet they’re not on Mars. I bet they’re inside people you already know. Impractical ideas that don’t scale well to billions of users but could have an incredible impact on a local economy and community (RIP Gowalla). Ideas that solve actual problems and create actual utility or connection. Small-scale ideas that when combined can breathe new life into a dead economy.</p>
<p>The definition of a healthy economy is actually one problem I had with the Biden administration. Liberals do a terrible job communicating economic accomplishments even though they outperform Conservative administrations by a large margin. When they do communicate it’s always in lagging indicators like GDP, the stock market, non-farm jobs, consumer price indexes, or low-unemployment numbers. Those are all well and good, but to me it all comes down to a single question: If I lost or quit my job today how easy would it be to find another similar job? To me economic mobility is the true sign of a healthy economy, the ability to have options. To be free.</p>
<p>I’m trying to stay optimistic, but the realist in me knows it’ll be some time until the economy comes back again. At a minimum, we’ll have to restart investments in science. Especially weird science. Even more weird than what you’re thinking right now. I’m talking super weird. And then that weird science takes 20 years to become practical applications. Through that public good is how we get the foundations like the Internet, WiFi, and GPS that have built the society we know and are dependent on today. It’s how we build the pipeline for tomorrow’s economy. But those innovations are on a decades timescale and –math-wise– I’m not sure I have that in me.</p>

## Spying on People Through Airportr Luggage Delivery Service

date: 2025-08-01, updated: 2025-07-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Airportr is a service that allows passengers to have their luggage picked up, checked, and  delivered to their destinations. As you might expect, it&#8217;s used by wealthy or important people. So if the company&#8217;s website is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/luggage-service-web-bugs-exposed-travel-plans-users-diplomats-airportr/">insecure</a>, you&#8217;d be able to spy on lots of wealthy or important people. And maybe even steal their luggage.</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers at the firm CyberX9 found that simple bugs in Airportr&#8217;s website allowed them to access virtually all of those users&#8217; personal information, including travel plans, or even gain administrator privileges that would have allowed a hacker to redirect or steal luggage in transit. Among even the small sample of user data that the researchers reviewed and shared with WIRED they found what appear to be the personal information and travel records of multiple government officials and diplomats from the UK, Switzerland, and the US...</p></blockquote>

## curl adds parallel host control

## Meta’s Favorite Product Isn’t AI. It’s the Copy Button.

date: 2025-07-31, from: Om Malik blog

An hour after I posted&#160;my piece about Meta&#8217;s Super Intelligence memo, a friend pinged me and pointed out that once again, Mark Zuckerberg has subsumed someone&#8217;s idea and phrase and presented it as his own: personal super intelligence. Not surprising, given that &#8220;copy&#8221; and &#8220;subsume&#8221; are on-brand for Zuck, who historically has not been shy &#8230;

## Easy sci-fi rectangles with corner-shape

date: 2025-07-31, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>In Chromium 139, CSS gets a new <code>corner-shape</code> property which unlocks some cool new CSS tricks. Most notably it gives us “squircles”, the mathematical superellipse shape introduced by Apple in iOS 7. Designers have been in love with them ever since and include them in every design comp using Figma’s “corner-smoothing” slider even tho CSS has no similar correlation… until now!</p>
<p><a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/understanding-css-corner-shape-and-the-power-of-the-superellipse/">Frontend Masters has a beautiful writeup on <code>corner-shape</code> and superellipses</a> showing that it goes way beyond squircles to make some real complex shapes. One capability they didn’t cover in that post is probably the most important of all: CSS <code>corner-shape</code> enables easy sci-fi rectangles.</p>
<p>By “sci-fi rectangles” I am of course referring to the sci-fi film and television trope where all rectangles (doors, windows, furniture, user-interfaces) have one to three angular corners instead of all corners being the old, boring, un-futuristic 90º rectangle corners. They are the cooler version of rectangles by all accounts.</p>
<figure>
<img id="toasters" src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/frakkin-toasters.jpg" height="338" width="600" alt="Screengrab from Battlestar Galactica showing the diagram of a cylon, the main antagonist robot from the series. The diagram is on a piece of 8-inch by 11-inch paper with 45-degree angular corners on the page. There's a black manilla folder behind the piece of paper that also has its corners cut to the same angle.">
<figcaption>
<p><em>Even the physical paper documents in Battlestar Galactica were sci-fi rectangles, how frakking cool is that!?</em></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There were ways to <code>image-mask</code> or <code>clip-path</code> yourself into a sci-fi rectangle with CSS, but those have some downsides and mathematical complexities. It couldn’t be easier with <code>corner-shape</code>, in fact it’s a two-liner:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.sci-fi {
	border-start-end-radius: 50px;
	corner-shape: bevel;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>My favorite version is probably when there’s two opposing corners notched out:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.even-more-sci-fi {
	border-start-start-radius: 50px;
	border-end-end-radius: 50px;
	corner-shape: bevel;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<style>
#toasters {
    @supports (corner-shape: bevel) {
      border-start-end-radius: 50px;
      corner-shape: bevel;
    }
}

#demo {
  --space: 50px; 
  padding: var(--space); 
  corner-shape: bevel; 
  background: var(--overlay, #fff); 
  border: 2px solid var(--accent, #09f);
  transition: border-radius 0.2s;

  @supports (corner-shape: bevel) {
    border-start-start-radius: var(--space); 
    border-end-end-radius: var(--space); 

    &:hover,
    &:focus {
      --hover-border: calc(var(--space) *1.5);
      border-start-start-radius: var(--hover-border); 
      border-end-end-radius: var(--hover-border);
    }
  }
}

 #demo-fallback {
  margin-inline: auto;
 }

@supports (corner-shape: bevel) {
  #demo-fallback { display: none; }
}
</style>
<div id="demo" tabindex="0">
If you're in a browser that supports `corner-shape` or have the experimental feature flag turned on, this paragraph will be a sci-fi rectangle. If you see a normal rectangle, then I've included a screenshot below for you.
</div>
<img id="demo-fallback" src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/scifi-rectangle.png" alt="The same paragraph above but the borders are angular sci-fi rectangles" height="287" width="1000">
<p>As demonstrated above <code>corner-shape</code> is a wonderful progressive enhancement. A browser doesn’t support squircles? They get rounded corners and the brand doesn’t fall over. You can also put corner-shapes in <code>@supports (corner-shape: bevel)</code> for even more graceful degradation. That’s what I did because a rounded corner is totes un-sci-fi, so I only enable the corner-shape if supported. Because <code>corner-shape</code> is not an <code>image-mask</code> or a <code>clip-path</code>, they’re automatically responsive and squeeze without any percentage-based tomfoolery. They’re animatable too! You can transition them on hover or focus if you want. The full power of CSS, baby!</p>
<p>One quirk I’ve discovered while playing with <code>corner-shape</code> is that the default browser <code>:focus-visible</code> outline won’t hug the corner-shape unless you re-define a custom <code>:focus-visible</code> outline style. That strikes me as weird, so <a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/OPyWpxR">I made a little reduced test case of this quirk</a> you can debug and tell me what obvious tidbit I missed.</p>
<p>Wrapping this up, I’m excited about <code>corner-shape</code> because it has real world implications. A product I work adjacent to is currently shipping 215kb of squircle <code>clip-path</code> masks in production right now. Yikes. That’s a lot for fancy rectangles. <code>corner-shape</code> will be a sizable web performance improvement for their users and reduce maintenance burdens over time. Wins all around.</p>
<p>So remember, kids: Friends don’t let friends ship 200+ KB of squircles in production. Talk to your friends about progressively enhanceable CSS features today!</p>

## 2025-07-23 Testing a reset of the one week jail

date: 2025-07-31, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-07-23-testing-a-reset-of-the-one-week-jail">2025-07-23 Testing a reset of the one week jail</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a number of people complaining about being banned and I&rsquo;ve been wondering whether I should reduce the ban-time for the escalation jail. Right now, if you&rsquo;ve been banned for 1h five times in a 24h period, you&rsquo;re banned for one week. What I f I reduced this one week to three days (&ldquo;one long weekend&rdquo;), for example?</p>

<p>As a test, I wanted to reset all the one week bans and see whether load explodes or not. If most of the scraping has ceased, then perhaps there would be no problem?</p>

<p>So around 10:30 local time, I made a backup of the weekly jail:</p>

<pre><code># fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned &gt; butlerian-jihad-week.json
# sed s/\'/\&quot;/g &lt; butlerian-jihad-week.json | jq length
2862
# fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned
[]
</code></pre>

<p>The backup has 2862 entries, the jail is now empty.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s watch Munin!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-1.jpg" alt="The graph shows the one week jail pretty constant at nearly 3000 entries dropping to zero moments ago." /></p>

<p>40 minutes later. What are you dooooing‽</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-2.jpg" alt="10 minutes after the reset, the 1h jail already has over 700 entries and in another 10 minutes, it has 850 entries." /></p>

<p>And who&rsquo;s doing it?</p>

<pre><code># asn-find (grep &quot;^2025-07-23 1.* \[butlerian-jihad\] Ban &quot; /var/log/fail2ban.log|cut -c 89-)\
    | cut -f2-3 | sort | uniq

</code></pre>

<p>The only obvious thing I can see is that Semrush and Microsoft are trying to crawl the site using their bots, one for their marketing and search engine optimisation and the other for their search engine itself. But remember: <a href="2023-10-04-search">2023-10-04 Search engines, the deal is off!</a>. I am no longer convinced that being listed by search engines is in my best interest.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-3.jpg" alt="A few hours later, the scene appears unchanged. There are four waves of blocks, going up to between 1000 and 1500 banned entries and coming back down again." /></p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the image, then perhaps the long term punitive ban doesn&rsquo;t have to be that long.</p>

<p>And what&rsquo;s the situation 24h later?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-4.jpg" alt="The fifth wave generates entries in the one-week ban. But the cycles for the one-hour ban continues and so more entries keep getting added to the one-week ban." /></p>

<p>And another day later:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-5.jpg" alt="The situation has stabilised around 1400 blocked entries." /></p>

<p>And another day later:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-6.jpg" alt="The bots were back and now we&rsquo;re at 2900 entries blocked for a week." /></p>

<p>Every day is worse. If you look at the graph below, you&rsquo;ll notice that Saturday morning just after 2:00 there was a huge wave of about 6000 entries that got blocked for an hour. The same wave repeats around 9:00, 13:00, 18:00. And then, nearly 24h later, just before 2:00, the fifth such wave rolls in. At at that point, the bans are added to both the one-hour and the one-week jail.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-7.jpg" alt="The one-week ban now has 9000 entries after a surge at 1:50 in the morning adding about 6000 new entries" /></p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-07-25</strong>. So now, two days after a reset, I&rsquo;d like to see who&rsquo;s hovering just below those limits I&rsquo;ve set. If they seem to be innocents, that would be an argument to raise the limits. If they seem to be bots, that would be an argument to lower the limits or, given that the system load is OK at the moment, to leave the limit as it is.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the various test.</p>

<p>First, &ldquo;active autonomous systems&rdquo;. On a good day, the limit is 500 requests per autonomous system.</p>

<pre><code># show-active-autonomous-systems --top 3
count	percent	ASN	AS
234	4.54	45102	ALIBABA-CN-NET Alibaba US Technology Co., Ltd., CN
172	3.33	208258	ACCESS2IT Access2.IT Network, NL
158	3.06	12880	DCI-AS, IR
total: 5158
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, Alibaba is a bot hoster in China. What about Access2.IT in the Netherlands?</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 208258 | log-request | rank-lines 
    176 /
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, that is also a bot. 2h is 120 minutes. This company is checking more than once per minute whether my sites are up. That angers me. They probably sell uptime data to other companies.</p>

<p>What about the autonomous system from Iraq?</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 12880 | log-request | rank-lines 
    164 /
</code></pre>

<p>The same bullshit! 😲</p>

<p>So my conclusion is that the limit could be lower! 😠</p>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at &ldquo;expensive end-points&rdquo;. These are the endpoints I&rsquo;m planning to <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/2025-07-13_AI_Scrapers">do away with</a>, eventually.</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log \
    | egrep '\baction=(rss|rc)\&amp;|\bsearch=' \
    | awk '{print $2}' \
    | asncounter --top 3 --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null

27	4.42	7922	COMCAST-7922, US
11	1.8	6939	HURRICANE, US
8	1.31	7713	TELKOMNET-AS-AP PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, ID
total: 611
</code></pre>

<p>Comcast in the United States seems to request all sorts of things:</p>

<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 7922 | log-request | rank-lines

</code></pre>

<p>Note how only one of these requests is one of the &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; URLs. But apparently it&rsquo;s also attempting to upload images! Looks like spiders, if you ask me.</p>

<p>What about Hurricane in the United States?</p>

<p>Maybe. 😬</p>

<p>Four requests means one request every half hour, for every feed. I guess it makes sense.</p>

<p>In any case, I seems that maybe these autonomous systems are hitting a lot of expensive end-points but in general, they are all focused on feed processing.</p>

<p>The autonomous system from Indonesia looks even more like a bot but in addition to that it also goes through all the archives, for every single page:</p>

<p>Hopefully most of that will be fixed once the forms all change from GET to POST. 😬</p>

<p>In any case, I don&rsquo;t feel like lifting this limit!</p>

<p>The last instance involves banning all the autonomous systems that are hitting &ldquo;no bots&rdquo; warnings. The web server does this redirect for various requests, including all user agents containing the words &ldquo;bot&rdquo;, &ldquo;spider&rdquo;, &ldquo;crawl&rdquo; etc.</p>

## Cheating on Quantum Computing Benchmarks

date: 2025-07-31, updated: 2025-07-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Peter Gutmann and Stephan Neuhaus have a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1237.pdf">new paper</a>&#8212;I think it&#8217;s new, even though it has a March 2025 date&#8212;that makes the argument that we shouldn&#8217;t trust any of the quantum factorization  benchmarks, because everyone has been cooking the books:</p>
<blockquote><p>Similarly, quantum factorisation is performed using sleight-of-hand numbers that have been selected to make them very easy to factorise using a physics experiment and, by extension, a VIC-20, an abacus, and a dog. A standard technique is to ensure that the factors differ by only a few bits that can then be found using a simple search-based approach that has nothing to do with factorisation&#8230;. Note that such a value would never be encountered in the real world since the RSA key generation process typically requires that &#124;p-q&#124; &#62; 100 or more bits [9]. As one analysis puts it, &#8220;Instead of waiting for the hardware to improve by yet further orders of magnitude, researchers began inventing better and better tricks for factoring numbers by exploiting their hidden structure&#8221; [10]...</p></blockquote>

Another benefit of ChatGPT. It forces you to think and express yourself in tight logical language. Garbage in garbage out. All of a sudden rigorous thinking is required to get a result. This is very different from social media, where garbage is rewarded.

You hear this from journalists a lot. The only way you can conclude this, imho, is if you aren't using the stuff. It's as if you were a journalist in the 60s and said the story of the Beatles is that their hair must be fake. OK, whatever you say, but have you listened to the freaking music?? I'm sure a lot of journalists in the 60s said bullshit like that but the Beatles did turn the world upside down, and it stayed that way. It marked the beginning of something very new. And, as with AI, <i>journalism missed the story</i>. If you don't trust the CEOs, that's okay, probably the right approach. But that doesn't mean they're wrong about the value of the tech. Develop sources the old fashioned way, and if you think money biases the CEOs in favor of the hype, listen to experts who don't have any stock in the companies.

## Before I go: Always buy the $200 Yamaha

date: 2025-07-30, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I don’t have much life advice but I do know one thing: Always buy the $200 Yamaha guitar.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about it, do it. Talk to any guitarist you know who has been playing awhile and they’ll have a story about a $200 Yamaha and how good it sounds relative to the price. It’s with uncanny regularity I encounter fellow travelers with a similar story about this particular cheap guitar.</p>
<p>My $200 Yamaha story growing up was my step-dad’s acoustic. He had two acoustic guitars actually; the Yamaha which stayed out propped against his bedroom wall and another one (I don’t remember the brand) with fancy jade inlays that stayed clasped in the green felt case under his bed. I wasn’t supposed to touch any of his guitars but I would sneak in and noodle on that Yamaha every chance I got. The Yamaha had a notable cheap lacquer “clack” to it when tapping the dreadnaught body and the sound it made when bumping into furniture was always harrowing, but the fretboard was smooth and it produced a sound that was both bright and deep; a surprise given the lightweight materials.</p>
<p>I stole some licks on the fancy under-the-bed acoustic a couple times, but the luxury materials produced a tinny sound with no body or resonance and despite its extra forbidden-ness it wasn’t even worth the trouble digging out of its case. The Yamaha with its casual out-of-the-case-because-I-only-cost-200-dollars vibes was not only easier to access, it was better on all accounts.</p>
<p>Is the $200 Yamaha the best guitar? No, probably not. Is it a great guitar? Emphatically, yes. An impeccable piece of Japanese engineering. I’ve owned $2,000 guitars, played friends’ $4,000 guitars, and the $200 Yamaha gives them all a run for their money every time. Good entry-level acoustic guitars from Martin and Taylor exist in the $500 range and they’re great purchases you won’t regret, but it’s not until the $1500 range that you start getting the material quality bumps those guitars deserve. But once you have a $1500 guitar, you start to baby it and hide it away in the case to protect it from scratches and bumps, from air of the wrong humidity, and from snoopy kids with clumsy hands. This is not a problem with the $200 Yamaha.</p>
<p>We bought a $200 Yamaha last month: a 3/4ths scale travel guitar. We went on a family beach vacation in July and my brother-in-law’s family notified us the day before that the cousins were having a no-device week. Worried our 12yo son would die –kidding, but he appreciates prior warnings about adjustments like this and we weren’t prepared for a fully offline week– we bought the $200 Yamaha to be an offline activity and have zero regrets. He noodled all week long and got noticeably better. Cousins and uncles even got into the mix trading riffs. It sounds phenomenal for a mini-acoustic (like a big acoustic!) but more importantly if it takes a tumble, gets stepped on by a toddler cousin, or filled with sand; we’re not even upset. A perfect travel guitar if there ever was.</p>
<p>Instruments are an intimate and personal item and choosing one can have an Ollivander’s Wand Shop element to it; you must find the one that speaks to you. And it’s up to you to treat yourself accordingly based on your budget. But what I will say is, from a dollar-per-quality or a cost-per-song perspective, you can’t go wrong with the $200 Yamaha.</p>

## Measuring the Attack/Defense Balance

date: 2025-07-30, updated: 2025-07-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s winning on the internet, the attackers or the defenders?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m asked this all the time, and I can only ever give a qualitative hand-wavy answer.  But Jason Healey and Tarang Jain&#8217;s latest Lawfare piece has <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/are-cyber-defenders-winning">amassed data</a>.</p>
<p>The essay provides the first framework for metrics about how we are all doing collectively&#8212;and not just how an individual network is doing. Healey wrote to me in email:</p>
<blockquote><p>The work rests on three key insights: (1) defenders need a framework (based in threat, vulnerability, and consequence) to categorize the flood of potentially relevant security metrics; (2) trends are what matter, not specifics; and (3) to start, we should avoid getting bogged down in collecting data and just use what’s already being reported by amazing teams at Verizon, Cyentia, Mandiant, IBM, FBI, and so many others...</p></blockquote>

## Apologize to customers

date: 2025-07-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kevinkelly.bsky.social/post/3lv4vlgcpkp22">Kevin Kelly writes</a>: "When a customer of yours complains, always apologize first and ask, 'What can we do to resolve this?' even if it is not your fault. Acting as if the customer is right is a small tax to pay to grow a business."</p>
<p>Amen. Google sent an email saying my Google Fi account was going to be cancelled if i didn't do something, so I clicked the link, everything looked fine. They sent more emails like this, again everything seemed in order. I contacted them via support (hard to find) and they said everything looked fine. They also said I should be sure there was enough credit in the account. I wrote back saying that was insulting, I've been a customer for a long time, and have never missed a payment, and they should apologize for the threats and wasted time. I got back a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/29/googleFiLotsOfWords.png">long email</a> that did everything but apologize. They also threw in a little gaslighting, talking about my emotional state (frustrated, unsettled). Companies aren't allowed to have opinions about customers' emotions, esp over email.</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/29/googleNeedsHelpWithThis.png"></center>Google needs to take a basic lesson in how to treat customers. </div></p>
<p>PS: My feeling was more <i>surprise</i> that Google, a large company with billions of users and millions of customers couldn't get something this simple right. </p>

## Recording vintage CRTs with a modern Sony mirrorless camera

date: 2025-07-29, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Recording vintage CRTs with a modern Sony mirrorless camera</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>

But what about Substack and Ghost? A lot of people do their writing there too? What about those people. Here's the cool part for all people who write on the web. The API we use in WordLand to hook up to WordPress is <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js">open and documented</a>. They don't break their APIs in WordPressLand. At least so far. You could say that API is a standard. And I bet it would be a lot easier for Ghost, for example, to support a limited subset of that API than it has been to get ActivityPub support implemented. Because the WordPress API is what I would call "really simple," and that's the thing I value most about a good API.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Now here's the real reason I need <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> and if you write for WordPress sites, I think you'll want it too. It's because WordPress is like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word">Microsoft Word</a> of web writing. If you ask someone how they do their site, in 2025, it's probably going to be WordPress. So if someone invites you to write a guest post on their blog, chances are pretty good I can write it in WordLand, and it'll be archived in my collection of writing, and easy for me to find, because that's what WordLand does for writers. So I was able to create the new post on the WordCamp site in less than a minute, and it was completely painless. And that's the point. Here's the screen shot:

Listened to a segment on today's <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">Brian Lehrer podcast</a> about how to keep the good feelings from a vacation when you get back home. Here's my idea. Before you leave make a list of the things you like about being on vacation. Take it home, put it somewhere you can find it when you're feeling down and want that feeling back. Pick one of the things on the list and do it. Your subconscious will tune into it as an act of self-love and give you some of the body <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin">chemistry</a> that you felt when you were hanging out at the beach or hiking the Applachian Trail. A similar idea in a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html">Bruce Sterling talk</a> in 2009.

## Tom Lehrer: Satirist, mathematician, inventor of the Jello shot

date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Liam Proven's articles at the Register

<h4><span class="label">Obituary</span> The greatest mathematician-cum-singer-songwriter of all time</h4>
      <p>The field of satirists and hit singer-songwriters who were also professional mathematicians and lecturers is a very small one, and as such, we feel sure Tom Lehrer was the greatest who ever lived… And he also invented the modern Jell-O shot.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Everything in ChatGPT is <i>so</i> nice. I just asked it about a random plant I got as a gift, and it gave me a beautiful <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/28/deltaDawn.png">one pager</a> with everything I would have had to spend time searching for all right there, beautifully laid out, and all the fine UI touches you might think of already in. It's studying us and learning, and picking out the good stuff, at least so far. The web was like this too in the beginning, mind-exploding inventions every day. We called them <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/08/26/mindBombsForY2k.html">mind bombs</a>. The journalists and social media influencers all just complain, while there is a revolution happening, progress that had slowed to a snail pace, or very often went in reverse, is now coming at breakneck speed. This is as transformative innovation as there has ever been, not that I have much perspective on those that happened before I was invented, but it's as big as the Beatles, the PC, web, mobile.

I’m primarily a writer, my podcasts reflect that, so most of the work I do on each podcast is in writing the show notes. I have a <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/69436e223b212315846f5944e0957504">template</a> the writing and audio flow through. Fairly standard stuff, the same approach used by Tumblr and many other blogging systems, including UserLand's Manila and Radio UserLand. Here's an <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">example</a> of a page rendered through that template. We’re doing similar things with WordPress using themes. The idea of WordLand is to do all the block-oriented work once, outside of the writing environment, then flow my writing through it, far away from the heavy lifting. It’s always how I’ve done my blogging tools. I understand WordPress so far has a steady workflow thru the block editor, but these are workflows for designers and programmers. WordLand is the flow for writers.

## 2025-07-27 My One Page Dungeon Contest submission

date: 2025-07-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-07-27-my-one-page-dungeon-contest-submission">2025-07-27 My One Page Dungeon Contest submission</h1>

<p>It all started with agroschim proposing a game on the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/Discord_Server">Grenzland Discord</a>: A pulp cover gets posted and we propose the title and elevator pitch for the module we’d write for it.</p>

<p>The first cover was <a href="https://www.perrypedia.de/wiki/Datei:PR0780.jpg">issue 780</a> of the longest running Science Fiction series, Perry Rhodan. It shows some dinosaurs, a river, canyon walls, and a flying golf-ball with antennas like some sort of spy-satellite.</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh Nugh and the bleeping Invasion: Gather your stoner friends, pick up those spears and travel through the subterranean dinosaur refuge to find the source of the flying drones that keep pestering your tribe. Infiltrate the lair of the rocket men and wrest the eye of eyes from their cold gauntlets and return your land to peace and quiet. A 16 page module for Wolf Packs &amp; Winter Snow and other old school role-playing games.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the words stood there, I liked it. The premise seemed to be somewhat non-violent. This was a mission to stop some activity, not to kill anything. It was about privacy and drones, which makes it relevant to today. It’s about tech level differences and power differences. It was intriguing.</p>

<p>And then I wrote up a One Page Dungeon based on that. 😍 There are <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2025/bleeping-bots/">two versions</a> for the entry: the one-page PDF for submission to the contest and <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2025/bleeping-bots/bleeping-bots.html">a web page</a> with some old school D&amp;D stats.</p>

<p>It’s no way close to <a href="https://themetalearth.blogspot.com/">Metal Earth</a>’s <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2011/Michael%20Gibbons%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Forgotten%20Depths.pdf">The Forgotten Depths</a>, but clearly inspired by that 2012 entry, of course. Back then I wrote up <a href="2012-05-15_The_Forgotten_Depths">some stats</a> to go along with the stat-less submission.</p>

<p>I feel that a first level group could conceivably beat it: get a suit at the volcano or enlist the dragonodon, approach the tower undetected and enter from above, then trick the only guard. Something like that. And I feel the entry provides enough opportunities for a careless party to mess up. 😆</p>

<p>Sadly, there’s no treasure to be found except blasters, rocket suits and a charging station. But perhaps that is enough.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%231PDC">#1PDC</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RPG">#RPG</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-07-28</strong>. Thanks for that email, Bjorn! Now the web version has some treasure values! 😄</p>

## Microsoft SharePoint Zero-Day

<p>Chinese hackers are exploiting a high-severity vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/sharepoint-vulnerability-with-9-8-severity-rating-is-under-exploit-across-the-globe/">steal data</a> worldwide:</p>

## July 27, 2025

date: 2025-07-28, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

On July 23 the X account of the Department of Homeland Security posted an image of an 1872 oil painting by John Gast, titled American Progress. Gast represented the American East on the right side of the painting with light skies, a rising sun, and the bustling port of New York City, full of ships. He painted the American West in darkness, through which bison and Indigenous Americans flee the people in the middle of the painting: white hunters, farmers, settlers, and stagecoach riders. Over the scene floats a giant, blonde Lady Liberty, evidently moving west, carrying a schoolbook and a telegraph wire being laced on poles along a train track behind her.

I wouldn't have opened this up before because of that would let in the weirdness of the internets. This way we can find out what people thought, as sanitized by ChatGPT.  BTW do you think the root of sanitized is sane? As the root of ignorant is ignore? Of course <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/27/chatgpttranscriptsaneignore.png">our friend</a> has the answer. One is and the other isn't.

## A Bingeworthy Sunday

date: 2025-07-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I wasn't planning on this, but there was a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/bingeworthySupport/issues/5">report</a> that there was a problem with <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>, looked into it and was able to fix it. </p>
<p>Source of problem: When I added a feature that lets you ask ChatGPT to review the program you're looking at, I broke the ability to add a new program to the database. It took about 15 minutes to track down and verify and another few minutes to fix -- and now that important function works again.  </p>
<p>As long as I was in there working around, I updated the <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml">Bingeworthy RSS feed</a> to only report program additions. The other events it was reporting just weren't as interesting.</p>
<p>I also added that feed to my <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/27/blogrolledBingeworthy.png">blogroll</a> on <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a>. </p>
<p>I'd say it works a lot better now. </p>
