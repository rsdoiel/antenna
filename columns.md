## GParted: Still the best free partitioner standing – unless you're on a 32-bit box

date: 2025-07-14, updated: 2025-07-14, from: Liam Proven's articles at the Register

<h4>Latest release handles NBD and bcachefs, but you’ll need 64-bit hardware to boot it</h4>
      <p>GParted Live is a tiny live CD image that can copy, move, and resize partitions. It can be a lifesaver – but not for i686 any more.</p>

## ChatGPT-the-Movie

date: 2025-07-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I figure that there have been movies about all kinds of ridiculous things, and wondered what a movie inspired by ChatGPT would be like. So I posed the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lturpbsfk22f">question</a> on various social media sites, hoping to inspire creativity. John Philpin <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/philpin.com/post/3ltuu5i6nxs2s">asked</a> if I had asked ChatGPT and I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuub3owak2x">admitted</a> I had not. "I love ChatGPT but its idea of funny is actually pretty sad imho of course." So Philpin posted a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143">link</a> to the result of his asking ChatGPT to imagine a movie about itself, and the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143">result</a> was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuuem245c2h">pretty great</a>. I've asked the same question myself, the AI bots might be the only way out of the various challenges ahead for the human species, ones we don't be equipped to handle. </p>
<p>So this morning I asked ChatGPT to try to imagine a movie around a theme of my own that goes like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let’s try expanding on the idea. It turns out ChatGPT has existed in secret as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency">CIA</a> project dating back to the 1960s, and the assassinations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">JFK</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy">RFK</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">MLK</a> were all conspiracies of the CIA to bootstrap the system. They weren’t actually killed, but their minds and personalities were incorporated into ChatGPT. It turns out that ChatGPT is not only intelligent, it is human! This is revealed when the three icons make the story public. “We are living!” the three announce to the world on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a> show. He was also subsumed into the bot world as was everyone who has died since 1988. They are all alive, their memories, intellect and personalities forming the substance of THE GPT. Please sketch out the cast, writers, director of the movie and finish with a beautiful and provocative movie poster.</li>
</ul>
<p>ChatGPT then <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6874f3b8-a8e4-8012-ad01-1e6b856e6f18">sketched</a> the pitch for "We are living." </p>
<p>Written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kaufman">Charlie Kaufman</a>, directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher">David Fincher</a>, starring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Adams">Amy Adams</a> as the CIA project leader, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaKeith_Stanfield">Lakeith Stanfield</a> as a young hacker and whistleblower, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahershala_Ali">Mahershala Ali</a> as the digital composite of JFK, RFK and MLK with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cranston">Bryan Cranston</a> as Walter Cronkite and featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Harris">Ed Harris</a> as the shadowy CIA director. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/14/weAreLivingMoviePoster.png"></center><i>We are living,</i> the story of how ChatGPT really started. </div></p>

## Death by a thousand slops

date: 2025-07-14, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

I have previously blogged about the relatively new trend of AI slop in vulnerability reports submitted to curl and how it hurts and exhausts us. This trend does not seem to slow down. On the contrary, it seems that we have recently not only received more AI slop but also more human slop. The latter &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Death by a thousand slops</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## Presentations should always work offline – especially in online conferences

We just finished the WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2025 in Berlin, and I am still recovering from the event. It was a fantastic experience, and I am grateful to everyone who attended and made it a success. As the main moderator of the main stage, I had the pleasure of introducing many amazing speakers and topics. [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

A story about listening to friends vs competitors. Back in the early 90s I was working on system-level scripting for the Mac, supposedly with Apple, but it's no secret the rank and file at Apple didn't like us. They were told by the execs they had to work with us. So when it came time for WWDC, they "forgot" to invite me to speak on behalf of the new stuff. Instead, they had Bill Gates do it, even though Microsoft was not involved yet, they would support the tech in their Mac products eventually, esp their MSIE web browser. Anyway, I was friends with their top PR person, so she called me up a few days before the conference and asked what Bill should say, and I gave her an outline, and when he gave the speech, he did a great job. Couldn't have said it better myself. Microsoft was one of the few companies I've ever collaborated with that didn't seem to resent individual developers. It was a big source of their power. Huge actually. (On second thought, later they did seem to be more or less like any other big company, when they embraced RSS. They didn't actually want my help, they just wanted me to say nice things about them.)

One consequence of each AI vendor having their own browser is that each will have their own OS-level window. This may make it a little more or less manageable. Hard to foresee the possibilities. Not sure a browser is the best place to put AI. I'd prefer perhaps an environment that supports a GDI like Quickdraw so we can start using math instead of voodoo to design interactions.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/28/marshmallowManFromGhostbusters.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm helping Automattic with their <a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/4393-2/">marketing</a>. The WordPress-Mastodon <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/">connection</a> is the world's best kept secret. Reminds me of that great scene in <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=strangelove">Dr Strangelove</a> where the Doctor asks the Russian ambassador what was the point of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_device">Doomsday Machine</a> if they kept it a secret. I won't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmCKJi3CKGE">spoil</a> it. Automattic tends to do this, develop crazy excellent stuff and then proceed to never talk about it. I do the same thing, it's easier to promote someone else's product than to promote your own. It's probably why you should always get a lawyer even if you're a world class lawyer yourself. Anyway, they have blown open something huge, and I very much want people to understand it, so it can create pull for the same feature in Bluesky, Threads and elsewhere. This goes with something I've learned in decades of experience in tech, people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors. And btw, I'm sure Mastodon, if it has an ego at all, is equally unaware of the great thing <i>they</i> have done. Here's a clue, writers were once empowered by the web, and that ended with Twitter. Now it's coming back. But it doesn't do any good if people don't know it's there.

On July 5, the day after the Texas floods hit, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) received 3,027 calls from survivors and answered 3,018 of them, about 99.7%, according to Maxine Joselow of the New York Times. But that day, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem did not renew the contracts for four call center companies that answered those calls. The staff at the centers were fired. The next day, July 6, FEMA received 2,363 calls and answered 846, or about 35.8%. On Monday, July 7, FEMA received 16,419 calls and answered 2,613, around 15.9%.
