## Pairwise Authentication of Humans

date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="https://ksze.github.io/PeerAuth/">easy</a> system for two humans to remotely authenticate to each other, so they can be sure that neither are digital impersonations.</p>
<blockquote><p>To mitigate that risk, I have developed this simple solution where you can setup a unique time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) between any pair of persons.</p>
<p>This is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two people, Person A and Person B, sit in front of the same computer and open this page;
<li>They input their respective names (e.g. Alice and Bob) onto the same page, and click &#8220;Generate&#8221;;
<li>The page will generate two TOTP QR codes, one for Alice and one for Bob;
...</li></li></li></ol></blockquote>

## Fire and Rain

date: 2025-02-09, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Twenty-fifth in the News Commons series Southern California has two seasons: Fire and Rain. Rain didn&#8217;t begin this year until a few days after Fire ended apocalyptically, incinerating much of Altadena and Pacific Palisades. Now Rain is here, with the occasional atmospheric river flowing across the faces of hills and mountains whose beards were just [&#8230;]

## Risk Aversion

date: 2025-02-09, from: Om Malik blog

This quote pretty much sums up what happens to successful people as they grow older. They lose the ability to risk it all. The more successful they are, the more they want to protect what they have. You go from being a creator to a protector/hoarder. One doesn&#8217;t have to look too far &#8212; those &#8230;

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-02-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I subscribed to <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired</a> because of their famous coverage of the Musk Coup, so I also added its feed to my blogroll so I could <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/blogrollscreen.png">see what I bought</a>, and was actually not surprised that they've been hit by the same disease all online publishing has, the need to bait the clicks, and of course not very much of it is hard-hitting.

If the URL of an image has search args, I wasn't getting the type correct and Bluesky rejected it. I used a post about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz's</a> statue unveiled in San Francisco <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/">yesterday</a> to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group developing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> in the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a year or two (I don't have the exact date of the meetup) he commited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html">suicide</a>. It was a real shock. Now, many years later -- a statue. And the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa1a8beacf79d90bc26105ba46c32072">random snarky slogan</a> my test script picked out was really <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/aaronScreenshot.png">appropriate</a> to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3lhqslgshmt2c">event</a>. It was a tragedy, because an older more confident Aaron would have made a big contribution. I often think about that.
