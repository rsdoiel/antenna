## Why Google was so great in its day

date: 2025-04-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A few days ago I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114335522071398061">wrote</a>: ChatGPT is to Google what Google was to library card catalogs.</p>
<p>I got a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114341684650193975">chance</a> to explain.</p>
<p>The great thing about Google when it was first out was that unlike previous search products, they searched everything, including our blogs, and that opened up knowledge to us that had been previously, for all of our history as a species, not accessible.</p>
<p>And LLMs are similarly revolutionary. I'm doing much better, deeper work, with great results for my users, than I could ever have accomplished with the system defined by Google. and for crying out loud it's not natural language search, all that tells me is you haven't bothered to use the freaking products before having a cynical opinion about them.</p>

It would be as sacred as academic freedom is in the university, or the First Amendment of the Constitution. It seemed to me that a university is the perfect place to create something like this. If we had such a setup, anywhere, at this time -- we would be working in earnest on an open alternative to twitter, one that is truly billionaire-proof right now, as opposed to "would be nice to have sometime in the future."

## What is Inbound RSS?

date: 2025-04-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I wrote a complex piece here earlier, but it's much simpler than it made it sound, so I decided to start again.</p>
<p>Feed readers view RSS as inbound, and blogging tools regard it as outbound. Same feed, different contexts. Like trains going in and out of a station. Inbound and outbound. </p>
<p>But some software views RSS in both directions. The best example is Twitter and its successors such as Mastodon, Threads and Bluesky. These products are for both for reading and writing. It makes sense to have outbound feeds, like a blogging tool, and it makes just as much sense as a consumer of feeds, like a feed reader, so we can easily publish stuff from other environments and people can subscribe to them exactly as if they used their editor to write it. No reason anyone needs to know. <i>This is absolutely the simplest and most web-like way to do federation. </i>And you don't need any new formats or protocols. It's all <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> on both sides. We totally know how to do RSS. It's ready to go. </p>
<p>What got me thinking about this a few years ago was Substack. I wanted to publish a nightly email newsletter from what I had posted that day on my blog, but I didn't have the patience to copy and paste and then reformat the text, by hand, when I already have that automated. They wanted to turn me into a computer. I tried that with Medium for a couple of years and it was awful. No thanks. What I needed them to have support Inbound RSS. </p>
<p>That's it. You now know all there is to know about <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Inbound%20RSS%22">Inbound RSS</a>. 😀 </p>

Their story says they know they need to be replaceable. But until they deliver on replaceability, it's a 5-alarm fire because of what happened with Twitter. It should not have been possible to acquire Twitter's user base. In hindsight we know it could have been avoided. And it can be avoided by Bluesky, but my guess is the last thing they want is to be replaced. If they really meant it, we could make it happen in a few weeks, and then we could build some really incredible systems, starting in late May, early June. I really believe that. Next journalist that interviews them should ask about this. Thanks for listening.

## 2025-04-04 Aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse

date: 2025-04-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-04-04-aufsteigende-rüstungsklasse">2025-04-04 Aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse</h1>

<p>Ich hatte schon vor einiger Zeit angefangen, über einen Wechsel zur aufsteigenden Rüstungsklasse nachzudenken. Neue Spieler fanden die traditionelle, absteigende Rüstungsklasse meistens doof. Die Leute, mit denen ich schon spielte, hatten sich an die absteigende Rüstungsklasse gewöhnt und wollten nicht umsteigen. Was tun? Mir gefällt die Absteigende Rüstungsklasse und die kleine Tabelle, wo man sich aufschreibt, welche Rüstungsklasse welchen Wurf benötigt, oder die seltsame Notation aus AD&amp;D Zeiten mit dem ETW0 (Engl. THAC0).</p>

<p>Irgendwann hatte ich mich halb durchgerungen, einen Versuch zu starten. Positiv aufgefallen ist sofort, dass die Tabellen im Handbuch für die Spielenden kompakter werden. Auf den Charakterbögen hat es nun auch etwas mehr Platz. Beides finde ich sehr positiv.</p>

<p>Eher unangenehm war, dass in allen anderen Dokumenten immer noch absteigende Rüstungsklassen zu finden war. Oje! Mit dem aktuellen Update hoffe ich, sie alle gefunden zu haben. Und wer ansonsten eine Rüstungsklasse unter 10 findet, konvertiert wie folgt:</p>

<ul>
<li>Für Menschen ohne Rüstung wird RK 9 zu RK 10.</li>
<li>Für alle anderen ist die aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse = 20 minus die absteigende Rüstungsklasse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beispielsweise: Ork mit RK 6 wird zu Ork mit RK 14.</p>

<p>Warum nicht &ldquo;19 minus die absteigende Rüstungsklasse&rdquo;? Nun ist alles um eins besser geschützt, würde man meinen. Der Vorteil ist aber, dass es nun zu neueren D&amp;D Versionen passt. Wenn ich beispielsweise bei D&amp;D 3.5 reinschaue:</p>

<p>Krieger mit Stufe 1 hat einen Angriffsbonus von +1 (gleich wie die Stufe, was mir sehr gefällt). Die Rüstungen sind: beschlagene Lederrüstung 13 (20-7); Kettenpanzer 15 (20-5); Plattenpanzer 17 (20-3). Aus dem Rahmen fällt &ldquo;ohne Rüstung&rdquo;, denn 10 ist nicht 20-9. Tja… Dafür habe ich keine Lösung. RK 11 für Leute ohne Rüstung gefällt mir auch nicht.</p>

<p>Und was ist mit den Trefferchancen? Vorher benötigte ein Krieger Stufe 1 eine 13 um einen Ork mit RK 6 zu treffen. Jetzt hat der Krieger einen Bonus von +1 um eine Ork mit RK 14 (20-6) zu treffen und braucht also immer noch eine 13. Insofern ist also alles gleich geblieben.</p>

<p>Neue Versionen:</p>
