## Cool tools to boost your browser

date: 2024-02-08, from: Om Malik blog

I gave up on Google&#8217;s Chrome a long time ago and switched to Brave before it started getting flak for doing questionable things. Then Josh Miller, the co-founder of The Browser Company (whom I met during his Branch.com days), offered me a chance to try out Arc, their new, clean, and refreshing take on a &#8230;

## Teaching LLMs to Be Deceptive

date: 2024-02-07, updated: 2024-02-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2401.05566v3">Sleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior: behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety...</p></blockquote>

## The ‘Do Nothing’ Strategy

Since the security of the U.S.-Mexico border is a top issue for many Americans, the Republican Party is betting that their strategy will win the day &#8230; or at least the presidential election. But it isn&#8217;t much of a plan. The strategy: Do nothing. The reason: Because Donald Trump said so.

## A New ’Joy‘ in Jazz

date: 2024-02-04, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Samara Joy has been called the new voice of jazz, a vocal phenom, a savior of the genre. This young lady is &#8220;joy&#8221; personified and today&#8217;s reason to smile, from her stunning jazz singing to her megawatt smile. The 24-year-old jazz sensation from the Bronx surprised a lot of people at last year&#8217;s Grammy Awards when she won not only Best Jazz Vocal Album but also Best New Artist, an award given only three times to a jazz artist. She will be back at the Grammys tonight as a presenter and again as a nominee. Take a listen to her incredible improvisation on the Grammy-nominated song &#8220;Tight.&#8221;
