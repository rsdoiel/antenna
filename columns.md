## Evaluating the Effectiveness of Reward Modeling of Generative AI Systems

date: 2024-09-11, updated: 2024-09-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>New research evaluating the effectiveness of reward modeling during Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10270">SEAL: Systematic Error Analysis for Value ALignment</a>.&#8221; The paper introduces quantitative metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of modeling and aligning human values:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aims to align language models (LMs) with human values by training reward models (RMs) on binary preferences and using these RMs to fine-tune the base LMs. Despite its importance, the internal mechanisms of RLHF remain poorly understood. This paper introduces new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of modeling and aligning human values, namely feature imprint, alignment resistance and alignment robustness. We categorize alignment datasets into target features (desired values) and spoiler features (undesired concepts). By regressing RM scores against these features, we quantify the extent to which RMs reward them ¬≠ a metric we term feature imprint. We define alignment resistance as the proportion of the preference dataset where RMs fail to match human preferences, and we assess alignment robustness by analyzing RM responses to perturbed inputs. Our experiments, utilizing open-source components like the Anthropic preference dataset and OpenAssistant RMs, reveal significant imprints of target features and a notable sensitivity to spoiler features. We observed a 26% incidence of alignment resistance in portions of the dataset where LM-labelers disagreed with human preferences. Furthermore, we find that misalignment often arises from ambiguous entries within the alignment dataset. These findings underscore the importance of scrutinizing both RMs and alignment datasets for a deeper understanding of value alignment...</p></blockquote>

## Podcast: Twitter President Kamala

date: 2024-09-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Harris must become president of Twitter before becoming president of the United States.</p>
<p>After the debate, Harris should be interviewed anywhere they'll have her. Go ahead and be overexposed. Answer every question with one of your major positioning statements. Call in to radio talk shows, podcasts, whatever you can think of. Biden hardly ever promoted himself. Not being heard <i>all the time</i> was his biggest sin. Harris should get accustomed to being accessible when she's in office. Keep the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/">kamalahq</a> snark channel going. This will have been Trump's contribution to American politics, no fear of being heard. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS">BRIC</a> countries == Brazil, Russia, India and China.  </p>
<p>Brazil's population is 215 million, US is 333 million, so Brazil is 64% of US.</p>
<p>When we win the Twitter presidency we will have Jumped the Trump. üòá</p>

## 2024-09-08 WebDAV no more

date: 2024-09-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-08-webdav-no-more">2024-09-08 WebDAV no more</h1>

<p>I must have implemented <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a> two or three times in the last decade or two. Just now I used <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_dav.html">mod_dav for Apache</a> to enable WebDAV for some directories.</p>

<p>In theory, it&rsquo;s great. You can treat the web server as a file server, connecting to it and using your regular file manager and text editor, using your favourite shell to do things. And if your website already uses permissions to restrict access to some locations, you can use the same config files to handle the making of changes.</p>

<p>In practice, however, the operating systems all have such brittle implementations that none of the solutions I had in production ever worked well. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it&rsquo;s Windows&rsquo; File Explorer, macOS&rsquo; Finder, the Gnome virtual file system via Nautilus or something else. The only thing that works is the command-line client <a href="https://notroj.github.io/cadaver/">cadaver</a>. It&rsquo;s the best. It works. Sooner or later, however, I realize that cadaver is probably not the tool I can expect non-technical people to use. It has the same user-interface as the old ftp command-line client.</p>

<p>I wonder what the issue is. WebDAV is 25 years old. It seems to me that something about the process or the spec must have set it up for failure. Perhaps it was a complex protocol? <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2518">RFC 2518</a> for WebDAV is from February 1999, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> for HTTP/1.1 is from June 1999. Perhaps the move from HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1 too away all the thunder. There was the DotCom craze and Web 2.0 and what not. Nobody had time for WebDAV? Nobody had a business model for WebDAV? People used FTP and SSH and all that for remote file access, there was no point doing it using web technology? Or perhaps there wasn&rsquo;t just one library to rule them all and in the darkness bind them?</p>

<p>In any case, I think I need to write this down so I don&rsquo;t fall for it again in two years. I&rsquo;ve been falling for it since 2005. Every wiki of mine gets WebDAV support ‚Ä¶ Looking at my blog it seems that <a href="2021-10-18_WebDAV_is_tricky">the last time</a> I spent five days to get this right. This time around I&rsquo;m just tired.</p>

<p>Time to disable <code>mod_dav</code> again.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23WebDAV">#WebDAV</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-09-10</strong>. Another option would be an explicit list of endorsed clients like <a href="https://notroj.github.io/cadaver/">cadaver</a>, <a href="http://rei.to/carotdav_en.html">CarotDAV</a>, <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/DAV">hDAV</a>, <a href="https://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a>, ‚Ä¶ But I have only used <code>cadaver</code> myself.</p>

## 30th anniversary in a month

date: 2024-09-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Are the Apple announcements like great reunions for people who have been going to these things regularly for 20+ years? If so, I can see the value in it. </p>
<p>I went to a reunion at Berkman, <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/08/222335.html">after 20 years</a>, and it was great, made me wonder why we didn't do it every year for the last 20. When you get a group of people together who do great things in a special moment, you should see them from time to time. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/03/22/accordionPlayer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">But I have a feeling there's a lot of turnover at the Apple events. In any case, I stopped going to them somewhere in the mid-90s, or more accurately they stopped inviting me. Yeah I was disruptive, but only in comparison to how well-behaved the other journos were (at that time I was writing for Wired). </p>
<p>The press was in awe of Apple and other Valley companies. I enjoyed that for a very brief period when my company went public after I had a hit Mac product. Then I became something of a pariah, because I <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">started blogging</a> and believe me the icons of the Valley for the most part <i>did not like it.</i> They were accustomed to fawning attention and rewritten press releases. But because I was an insider, I had an idea where the bodies might be buried, and I wrote about it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Woz</a> liked it. I was popular at the parties, I guess. </p>
<p>BTW, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Roizen">Heidi Roizen</a> once observed that I took a date to an Apple announcement (the one where Steve came back). There weren't many people there, maybe 20 or 25. </p>
<p>Jeff Jarvis wrote in the foreword to his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-We-Weave-Internet-Misanthropes/dp/1541604121">upcoming book</a> that I'm like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig">Zelig</a> of tech. This is what he meant, imho. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>
<p>We're coming up on the 30th anniversary of my blog, one month from tomorrow. You won't hear anyone from tech applauding, and you probably won't hear anything from the old bloggers. But I have something special in mind myself. Hopefully it'll come together in the next month, or sooner. :-)</p>
<p>Let's go back to 1994, by looking to the future. You won't need an invite, btw. It'll open to everyone.</p>

## Australia Threatens to Force Companies to Break Encryption

date: 2024-09-09, updated: 2024-09-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In 2018, Australia passed the Assistance and Access Act, which&#8212;among other things&#8212;gave the government the <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/australias-assistance-and-access-act">power</a> to force companies to break their own encryption.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Assistance and Access Act includes key components that outline investigatory powers between government and industry. These components include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical Assistance Requests (TARs): TARs are voluntary requests for assistance accessing encrypted data from law enforcement to teleco and technology companies. Companies are not legally obligated to comply with a TAR but law enforcement sends requests to solicit cooperation.
...</li></ul></blockquote>

## Peering in the social web

date: 2024-09-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A very practical issue. </p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l3njg5jhft2k">BlueSky</a> has a 300 character limit, which is less than the other services I cross-post to, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mastodon: 500 (using mastodon.social as benchmark)</li>
<li>Threads: 500</li>
<li>Twitter: 10000 (assume paying the montly fee)</li>
<li>RSS: no specific limit</li>
<li>WordPress: no specific limit</li>
<li>BlueSky: 300</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be a problem when we eventually get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering">peering</a> working cross-network among twitter-like systems.</p>
<p>It looks to me, just eyeballing this list, that 500 is a good place to start, although I don't think ultimately there should be any specific limits. </p>
<p>We saw that clearly when RSS 0.91 was the most recent version, there were limits in the Netscape doc, but they were ignored by content sources, which is why I took them out in the 0.92 and 2.0 versions. </p>
<p>Peering is simpler than federation. It would enable people to send messages across these boundaries, but wouldn't handle the engagement features, likes, replies, forwarding. It's what many people are starting to do now, by hand. There's no way to put it off, imho -- the Bluesky limit is already hard to deal with. </p>

Supplements are a Rising Cause of Liver Failure by Dr. Jen Gunther &#8230;the risk of supplement-related liver injury and liver injury severe enough that liver transplantation is needed has increased dramatically over the past 20 years.
