My answer as a former teaching assistant who graded lots of student programs, absolutely. It rivals the intellect of every human being I know, including professors. It hasn't learned yet how to synthesize new ideas, it seems. And there are strong guardrails that keep it from going into certain areas. It is more capable than we know, therefore. BTW, I didn't realize he teaches at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_University">Tulane</a>. I got my undergraduate degree there in 1976.

## Privacy Implications of Tracking Wireless Access Points

date: 2024-05-29, updated: 2024-05-28, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Brian Krebs <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/why-your-wi-fi-router-doubles-as-an-apple-airtag/#more-67551">reports</a> on research into geolocating routers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple and the satellite-based broadband service Starlink each recently took steps to address new research into the potential security and privacy implications of how their services geolocate devices. Researchers from the University of Maryland say they relied on publicly available data from Apple to track the location of billions of devices globally&#8212;including non-Apple devices like Starlink systems&#8212;and found they could use this data to monitor the destruction of Gaza, as well as the movements and in many cases identities of Russian and Ukrainian troops...</p></blockquote>

The defense and the prosecution today made their closing statements in the New York criminal case against Trump for falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels. The payment was intended to stop her account of her sexual encounter with Trump from becoming public in the days before the 2016 election, when the Trump campaign was already reeling from the Access Hollywood tape showing Trump boasting of sexual assault.

People need their own AIs. Personally and collectively. We won&#8217;t get them from Anthropic, Apple, Google, Meta, or Microsoft. Not even from Apple. All of those companies will want to provide AIaaS: AI as a Service, rather than AI that&#8217;s yours alone. Or ours, collectively. The People&#8217;s AI can only come from people.

## Library of Congress: Designing Storage Architectures 2024

date: 2024-05-28, from: David Rosenthal's blog

I participated virtually in  the 2024 Library of Congress <a href="https://digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/storage24.html"><i>Designing Storage Architectures for Digital Collections</i></a> meeting. As usual, there were a set of very interesting talks. The slides from the presentations are now online so, below the fold, I discuss the talks I found particulary interesting.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<h3><a href="https://digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/DSA2024/loc_dsa2024_website_0104_Lauhoff_Libary_of_Congress_2024_IBM.pdf"><i>NAND, HDD and Tape Storage Technology Trends</i></a></h3>
As has become traditional, IBM's Georg Lauhoff and Gary M Decad presented a detailed overview of the storage market. Five slides are of particular interest.<br />
<br />
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgC_cpwAdM-BFCEYvFW5jtLSWO2TJ1lJJzbi1n26HnJ5s_wELeb70i10wUMDb858Brapurcm8FD8aQGYLFXCYo_6bsfXIqC5B97KbsAjpHeR0XtIdd4iSYOk6s4rg0K2jq1ZAaCU0z9fsL0Q_pm6Veem4XRIKRBFxG1_Mi6EgP-5Zqz2lq1glpszj8TPvWT/s1505/ArealDensity.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="822" data-original-width="1505" height="109" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgC_cpwAdM-BFCEYvFW5jtLSWO2TJ1lJJzbi1n26HnJ5s_wELeb70i10wUMDb858Brapurcm8FD8aQGYLFXCYo_6bsfXIqC5B97KbsAjpHeR0XtIdd4iSYOk6s4rg0K2jq1ZAaCU0z9fsL0Q_pm6Veem4XRIKRBFxG1_Mi6EgP-5Zqz2lq1glpszj8TPvWT/w200-h109/ArealDensity.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Source</td></tr></tbody></table>
The first is their log-linear graph of the progress of areal density of hard disk (HDD), tape and NAND flash over the last three decades:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Tape</b> has improved its areal density at a very consistent ~27%/year. This has been possible due in part to improvements in both media and heads. But, as the graph shows, primarily because the bits on tape are currently about the size that bits on hard disk were two decades ago. This gives tape a lot of headroom before it runs into the pyysical limits.</li>
<li><b>HDD</b> was improving its areal density at around 35%/year until, around 2010, it got too close to the physical limits. Since then it has been growing around 6%/year, despite <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search?q=Pangloss&amp;max-results=20&amp;by-date=true">continual Panglossian predictions</a> from the industry.</li>
<li><b>NAND</b>, in which category IBM includes everything from enterprise SSDs to SD cards, saw explosive growth from the late 1990s to the late 2000s, growing about 3 orders of magnitude in around a decade.It then slowed to a mere 32%/year, meaning that it is still growing significantly faster than the other media.</li>
</ul>

IBM's second pair of graphs shows (a) a log-linear plot of the Exabytes shipped each year since 2008, and (b) the percentage of the total represented by each medium:<br />
<ul>
<li>The graph of Exabytes shipped shows NAND growing three times faster than the other media, that tape's growth rate is again very consistent, and that drops in HDD shipments for 2022 and 2023 have made the total shipments for HDD and NAND about the same.</li>
<li>The market share graph shows tape maintaining a small share slightly eroded by HDD. But NAND is rapidly eroding HDD's share.</li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5wmJlsJIsJdTdyfnuEsdWPLrugQ0_OEWe_3rlqy7-BS-ljL9Qo9-fmSHwQi47tnk69KzrgjWlLdq2aPs3IwasC-3y2148bOxa6fNMQRw1ImCK0o7ffmqKvApAFnB6icDherdFwLW68__2Htc0KJB5ttAJusZZ27qc3m_teFB0749Ph87Y_ghHtXr0PhuV/s1486/CostTrends.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="833" data-original-width="1486" height="112" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5wmJlsJIsJdTdyfnuEsdWPLrugQ0_OEWe_3rlqy7-BS-ljL9Qo9-fmSHwQi47tnk69KzrgjWlLdq2aPs3IwasC-3y2148bOxa6fNMQRw1ImCK0o7ffmqKvApAFnB6icDherdFwLW68__2Htc0KJB5ttAJusZZ27qc3m_teFB0749Ph87Y_ghHtXr0PhuV/w200-h112/CostTrends.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Source</td></tr></tbody></table>
The next slide shows (a) a log-linear plot of the cost of a terabyte over time (the Kryder rate), and (b) the ratio between NAND and HDD, and HDD to tape:<br />
<ul>
<li>The Kryder rate graph shows  both NAND's and HDD's rate slowing in the late 2000s. Tape again has a more consistent rate.</li>
<li>The cost ratio graph shows why NAND is rapidly eroding HDD's market share, as its cost disadvantage is decreasing exponentially. The cost ratio between tape and HDD has been fairly constant, which likely explains why tape's market share has suffered slight erosion.</li>
</ul>
<table align="right" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="5" cols="2" rules="groups">
<thead>
<tr><th>Medium</th><th align="right">$/TB</th></tr>

<tr><td>NAND</td><td align="right">50</td></tr>
<tr><td>HDD</td><td align="right">16</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tape</td><td align="right">2.6</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Their table of 2023 costs shows that NAND is more than 3 times as expensive as HDD. But this is an average across the whole range of NAND and HDD markets. Much NAND goes into market segments where it does not compete with HDD, such as SD cards, USB drives and phones. Whereas most HDD is 3.5" drives in PCs and data centers, where it competes only with enterprise flash. So in markets where they compete, the cost differential will be substantially higher.<br />
<br />
They have two slides that echo topics I have posted about fairly often. The first points out that industry projections of future areal density (and thus cost) routinely exaggerate the rate of growth by at least 10%. This why I frequently report on how happy the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search?q=Pangloss&amp;max-results=20&amp;by-date=true">good Dr. Pangloss</a> is with the storage industry.<br />
<br />
The second of them expresses skepticism about the prospect of DNA storage impactuing the market. Their cost graph shows the cost to write a terabyte of DNA is around 10 orders of magnitude more than for HDD, and the cost to read it once is around 3 orders of magnitude more than buying a terabyte of HDD. They write:<br />
<ul>
<li>Very slow to read and write.</li>
<li>Very expensive.</li>
<li>Large Market size needed to develop technology; a sub-tier below tape storage
is small.</li>
</ul>
I pointed this out in 2018's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html"><i>DNA's Niche In The Storage Market</i></a>. Even if projections about the increase in demand for archival storage pan out, it will be hard for new media to compete with tape.<br />
<br />
They also write something mystifying — "Not so stable", citing <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fbiotech12020044"><i>DNA Data Storage</i></a> by Tomasz Buko, Nella Tuczko, and Takao Ishikawa of the University of Warsaw. This paper contends that DNA is vastly <i>more</i> stable than tape, or any current medium:<br />
<blockquote>
For years, a DNA specimen collected from a 700,000-year-old horse was considered to be the oldest extracted DNA. However, in 2021, this record was pushed to 1 million years. DNA extracted from mammoth teeth was successfully extracted and sequenced. Additionally, scientists managed to sequence 300,000-year-old mitochondrial DNA from humans and bears. These examples perfectly illustrate the longevity of DNA and proves its usefulness for archeological purposes or data storekeeping. If stored in optimal conditions and dehydrated, DNA can possibly endure for millions of years.

Jon Trantham's look at the hard disk market was interesting. First, his graph of demand for nearline HDDs explains why the industry suffered hard times recently and why they believe the future looks brighter. A period of rapid growth led to an inventory buildup from exuberant demand forecasts, but the inventory has been depleted and demand is now rising. One might be skeptical of the rate of demand recovery in the graph, but at least the US economy suggests rising demand is plausible.<br />

His slide on IDC's market forecast supports my contention that IBM's cost ratio between NAND and HDD is misleading. The non-cloud HDD market is projected to be a small proportion of the total,  and to grow slowly. The vast bulk of the HDD market is for cloud storage, and thus the effective cost ratio is between HDD and enterprise SSDs. This would be much greater than IBM's overall estimate of 3.<br />

Current 16TB drives have 9 1.78TB platters. Seagate recently started shipping 30TB drives with 10 3TB platters. If they are right a 10 platter drive in 2026 would be 50TB, or around 3x the current drive capacity. This would certainly help maintain HDD's market share.<br />
<br />
Some additional topics:<br />
<ul>
<li>Seagate is working to move HDDs to the NVMe interface, to simplify and speed up datacenter systems.</li>
<li>Their sustainability efforts include trying to avoid customers shredding drives at their end-of-life. This is driven by customers requirement for data security. But Seagate encrypts the data on the platters and securely erase it by overwriting the key. The problem is to persuade customers that this satisfies their requirement. Seagate also wants to recover the rare earth magnets by industrial-scale disassembly of the drives.</li>
<li>Given a target of 98% drive reliability, as the number of platters increases the number of heads increases and thus the required reliability of the heads increases. Seagate is advocating that, in the case of head failure, the drive remains in use with reduced capacity. By provisioning a pool of spare drives, and avoiding failing an entire drive if a single head fails, the cost of ownership can be significantly reduced. 40-60% of all drive failures are single head failures.</li>
</ul>

The first slide of Microsoft's Aaron Ogus and Shashidar Joshi's talk shows why cloud systems like Azure are dominating the industry.<br />
<br />
Their observations from the experience of running Exabytes of archival storage containing trillions of objects and servicing billions of requests each month are:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Writes dominate</li>
<li>Reads are infrequent</li>
<li>Small reads require low latency random access</li>
<li>Large reads require good throughput</li>
<li>Archive Storage system needs dynamic provisioning to account for workload variances</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
All the early studies showed that archival storage workloads are write-domminated, because most archival data is written and very rarely accessed. That's why it has been archived. It is reasssuring to know that this is still true in the cloud era. Given this, and that the Service Level Agreements for cloud archives do not require low latency, it isn't clear why Microsoft thinks this is important.<br />
<br />
The challenges Microsoft sees with their current technologies are:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mechanical overheads lead to latencies</li>
<li>Environmental conditions limit deployment capabilities</li>
<li>Uncertainty with roadmaps, capacities and costs</li>
<li>Need for media migrations at EOL</li>
<li>Opportunity for new storage technologies</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
The environmental requirements of current technologies were one reason for <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook's use of optical storage</a>, it only needed warehouse space not a data center. Anecdotal reports at the meeting revealed serious issues with moving tapes between environments.<br />
<br />
The uncertainties are always with us, not least because the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/08/economic-model-of-long-term-storage.html">economics of long-term storage</a> depend strongly on interest rates. The "need for media migration at EOL" is one major motivation for the use of quasi-immortal media, such as Project Silica. But this is illusory. As I wrote about <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook's optical cold storage</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
No-one expects the racks to sit in the data center for 50 years, at some point before then they will be obsoleted by some unknown new, much denser and more power-efficient cold storage medium.
</blockquote>
Earlier this year I discussed Microsoft Research's view of the "opportunity for new storage technologies" in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/microsofts-archival-storage-research.html"><i>Microsoft's Archival Storage Research</i></a>. They are pursuing two technologies, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">DNA storage</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">Project Silica</a>. Ogus and Joshi discuss Project Silica, claiming that it provides "Performance (Random IO) per TB metric better than currently available Archive technologies". But part of the design of Project Silica is that the write and read drives are different, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">thus</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This allows independent scaling of read and write throughput.
</blockquote>
Their claim depends upon the system being configured with enough write (if they meant I) or read (if they meant O) drives.<br />
<br />
<h3><a href="https://digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/DSA2024/loc_dsa2024_website_0107_Moore_LOC_FM_2024.pdf"><i>The Data Storage Industry Gets Ready for AI</i></a></h3>
Fred Moore made the important point that archival storage faced a significant risk of a Vertical Market Failure (VMF):<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Zettabyte scale secondary storage market (cold, archive) has become the exclusive domain of few suppliers.</li>
<li>IBM is the only (1) tape drive developer/supplier controlling the entire tape ecosystem specifications.</li>
<li>Fujifilm and Sony are the only (2) LTO tape media suppliers.</li>
<li>HPE, IBM, Quantum and Spectra are the primary large-scale tape and library suppliers.</li>
<li>Seagate, Toshiba and WD are the only (3) remaining HDD suppliers.</li>
<li>(Tape - WD), (HDD - Seagate and TDK) are the only R/W head manufacturers.</li>
<li>Will current HDD and tape development roadmaps keep pace with demand?</li>
<li>HSDCs leverage their bargaining and buying power to drive down prices impacting vendor margins, R&amp;D investments.</li>
<li>In the event of a secondary storage VMF, sustainability challenges will become insurmountable for HDDs to address.</li>
<li>As supplier profit margins become insufficient, future R&amp;D funding, roadmaps, will place innovation at significant risk.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
Archival storage is a very small part of the total storage industry. NAND and HDDs pay for their R&amp;D in the much bigger online and nearline markets. Tape leverages a little of that, in that its head technology is based on HDD head technology, but in general has to fund R&amp;D solely from the archive market. And so will potential novel archival storage technologies, such as DNA and Project Silica. Fundamentally, companies don't want to invest in archival storage because it doesn't generate income, so the market isn't just small, but under significant margin pressure. This is why I wrote <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/03/archival-media-not-good-business.html"><i>Archival Media: Not a Good Business</i></a> six years ago. If and when NAND eventually displaces HDD for nearline storage, the reduced market will definitely cause a VMF, with knock-on effects on tape.<br />

## A common web component learning blunder

date: 2024-05-28, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Through stalking the <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/webcomponents">#WebComponents</a> hashtag and <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-components/">my Frontend Masters course</a>, I’m privy to a lot of developers’ first experiences with web components. There’s a wide range of people digging in, but the most common first-time experience I come across is a developer coming from a classical component framework like React with JSX going straight to writing vanilla Web Components, becoming frustrated, and then deeming web components “not ready for primetime.”</p>
<p>Ignoring for a moment that web components <em>do</em> exist in the primetime and power some big and complex primetime web applications like Adobe’s Photoshop for Web, I half-understand this perspective. I understand the desire to not have a major dependency. I hate this bloated <code>node_modules</code> hellhole we’ve built over the last decade and while I’m not a <code>npm install</code> my problems away guy… I think this puritanical approach to dependencies is a misstep when diving into web components for the first time.</p>
<p>The analogy I’ve been using is that this is like jumping from a tall 130 kilobyte-story building (ReactDOM) right into the zero kilobyte sewers of web components. If you take anything from this post, please understand this: <em>web components (most likely) weren’t designed for you</em>. Not to dissuade you from using them, but they were <a href="https://blog.domenic.me/the-extensible-web/">purposefully designed</a> to be <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">a low-level bare metal primitive</a> for library authors to build on; they were designed to be used with a library, a thin layer of abstraction butter on top.</p>
<p>To understand this disparity further, let’s look at an example of what writing a component in a “modern” framework <em>feels</em> like…</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="js"><span class="c1">// React</span>

<p>Can you do this in vanilla web components? Sure. But it looks like this…</p>

<p>This is a boring, imperative set of instructions for building the component with a little bit of <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> mixed in there… and ugchk… it sucks. It’s even more verbose with more interactive elements or a slew of reactive props and attributes.</p>
<p>Let’s see what 7 kilobytes of Lit gets us….</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now we have a component that’s almost identical to the familiar world of JSX but <em>without any Babel transforms or build steps</em>. For 7 kilobytes you get a lot more than some syntactic sugar, you get…</p>
<ul>
<li>A thin, tree-shakeable layer of abstraction for a modern developer experience</li>
<li>Reactive updates without VDOM</li>
<li>A more granular component lifecycle with a <code>render()</code> function</li>
<li>A cleaner way of registering and using reactive attributes and properties without overloading the <code>attributeChangedCallback</code></li>
<li>Template directives like <code>@click</code> for event handling and directives for JavaScript values (arrays, objects, etc).</li>
<li>And an <code>html</code> tagged template literal with an under-appreciated superpower ✨ that gives your components atomic updates under-the-hood.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s value in learning how bare metal vanilla web components work in the same way there’s value in knowing how <code>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat()</code> works, but you probably want to use <a href="https://day.js.org/">Day.js</a> for your day-to-day work. You can totally <a href="https://hawkticehurst.com/writing/bring-your-own-base-class/">write your own base class abstraction</a> – and I want you to have the <code>JeffElement</code> base class of your dreams, I do – but you may find out (<a href="https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/building-custom-elements-with-a-library/">like Cory LaViska from Shoelace found out</a>) that after you write all your little helper functions and utilities that you’ll end up with something almost the exact same size and feature set as Lit, but not as well supported nor as battle-tested.</p>
<p>This makes me sound anti-vanilla web components and I’m not that by any means. Vanilla web components are a perfect fit for <a href="https://github.com/davatron5000/awesome-standalones">standalone components</a> and the Light DOM-forward flavor of “<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">HTML web components</a>”, but I think the people having the most fun in this space are JavaScript minimalists who already prefer writing vanilla JavaScript. People like myself.</p>
<p>“If I have to use a library how is this any different than any other framework lock-in?” This is a valid question and one worthy of its own post, but I think you’ll find the lock-in costs of a web component library pretty minimal. Because all web components libraries extend a common base class, there’s a linear pathway out of vendor lock-in if necessary.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is this; next time you’re thinking about jumping from 130 kilobytes of developer convenience, maybe consider giving yourself a 7 kilobyte landing pad to cushion the fall.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>There’s ways around the <code>innerHTML</code> call like by writing the template in your HTML instead. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

Here's a problem I have with the ChatGPT app. I can't find the conversations I had with it a month ago. And I need to. They desperately need a Bookmarks menu. I'm sure their corporate customers are screaming about this, because they need groupware too. Are they partnering with Slack, or is Slack doing their own, for example?

Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc should collaborate on new ways to do software docs and user interaction using AI. It's an incredible application, it will revolutionize how useful computers are to people, and the only people whose writing is ingested are employees of the companies. Not only will it increase utility, it will demonstrate in a very observable way how transformational the technology is. Probably will do nice things for the value of the stock too.

## Lattice-Based Cryptosystems and Quantum Cryptanalysis

date: 2024-05-28, updated: 2024-05-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Quantum computers are probably coming, though we don&#8217;t know when&#8212;and when they arrive, they will, most likely, be able to break our standard public-key cryptography algorithms. In anticipation of this possibility, cryptographers have been working on quantum-resistant public-key algorithms. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) has been <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization">hosting a competition</a> since 2017, and there already are several <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-algorithms-2022">proposed standards</a>. Most of these are based on lattice problems.</p>

## 2024-05-23 Death and dying

date: 2024-05-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">2024-05-23 Death and dying</h1>

<p>This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am old enough to be an adult about it.</p>

<p>One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn&rsquo;t go myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn&rsquo;t there for my sister&rsquo;s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours, back then. I don&rsquo;t know how things are now. There was school and stuff and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn&rsquo;t feel very close. It just felt weird. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was supposed to mean.</p>

<p>Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his heart is failing; they can&rsquo;t give him his heart medication because the kidneys are at their limits, can&rsquo;t have him move around because he&rsquo;s weak, and so he&rsquo;s breaking down. I mean, he&rsquo;s calm, he knows what&rsquo;s happening, and he&rsquo;s very, very tired. He&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>

<p>I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to go one day. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines. I&rsquo;ll be very, very tired. I&rsquo;ll just want to go home. I also won&rsquo;t want anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll feel that I lived a good life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will be able to let go and be at peace. It&rsquo;s what I hear about my stepfather.</p>

<p>But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and Germany and my, and my mother, and one after another people start crying, choking up, it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s a that invisible choker, grabbing us, one after another.</p>

<p>I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back to haunt us, now.</p>

<p>To go and support each other.</p>

<p>Go and hug your loved ones.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Family">#Family</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn’t look good at all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping, mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us, saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes, stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.</p>

<p>There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister, my sister, my half-brother’s wife, their kid, my mom… the kid was the only one that seemed unperturbed. “Don’t be sad, grandma!”</p>

<p>Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of them super nice. We’ll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it’s not my partner that has died.</p>

<p>I’m happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I’m happy we were all there for each other.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on the radio.</p>

## Truth, Math, and Models

date: 2024-05-27, updated: 2024-05-27, from: Ron Garret

(Part 8 in a series on the scientific method)In the last installment I advanced a hypothesis about what truth is, which is to say, I suggested a way to explain the broad consensus that appears to exist about truth.&nbsp; That explanation was: there is an objective reality "out there", and true statements are those that in some sense correspond to the actual state of affairs in that objective

## AI Slop is the new spam!

date: 2024-05-27, from: Om Malik blog

Slop is the new Spam. Slop is unwanted AI-generated content. Most AI-powered products don’t truly have product/market fit. That’s because they are easy to build (wrappers) and it’s easy to make grandiose promises on a website. Delivering value is an entirely other thing. Product marketing is far ahead of product value in most cases. Hiten &#8230;

## Silicon Valley’s Empathy Vacuum

date: 2024-05-27, from: Om Malik blog

In a recent podcast, Adobe Chief Product Officer Scott Belsky&#160;said&#160;that startups and founders jump into the fray and desire to do&#160;the impossible&#160;but overlook one small thing — empathy. I&#160;have&#160;talked about the need for empathy for more than a decade now —&#160;in&#160;2013,&#160;2014,&#160;2016,&#160;and then in&#160;2017. I am glad Scott is taking up the issue. “What should have &#8230;

## Journeys

date: 2024-05-27, from: Ayjay blog

Early in Terrence Malick’s masterpiece A Hidden Life (2019), Franz Jägerstätter and his wife Franziska (Fani) sit at the kitchen table in their Austrian farmhouse and reminisce about their first meeting. Fani thinks back to Franz’s arrival in the village, and as she does we cut to a shot, seen from behind and slightly above, [&#8230;]

## May 26, 2024

date: 2024-05-27, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Tomorrow is Memorial Day, the day Americans have honored since 1868, when we mourn those military personnel who have died in the service of the country&#8212;that is, for the rest of us. For me, one of those people is Beau Bryant. When we were growing up, we hung out at one particular house where a friend&#8217;s mom provided unlimited peanut butter and fluff sandwiches, Uno games, iced tea and lemonade, sympathetic ears, and stories. She talked about Beau, her older brother, in the same way we talked about all our people, and her stories made him part of our world even though he had been killed in World War II 19 years before we were born.

The best <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug">campaign commercial</a> ever. So simple. A nostalgic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_(Simon_%26_Garfunkel_song)">song</a>, beautifully performed. Stock footage of American workers and families, interspersed with video from campaign events. These things aren't complicated. I bet Bernie and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Garfunkel">S&G</a> would let Biden use the same format.

When you get stuck, look at your most recent emotional dominoes. Do your last few scenes logically connect?

date: 2024-05-26, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

While it&#8217;s not officially summer yet, the town is coming to life. The lilacs and apple trees are blooming over the forget-me-nots, and over them all is the bright blue sky of the coming summer. For me, though, the clearest sign of the change of seasons is that Buddy is back on the water, and sunrise photos like this are waiting for me on my phone when I get up many hours after he has headed out to haul.
