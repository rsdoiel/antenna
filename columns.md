Sometimes ChatGPT just <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/9c47fbcf-7ba9-43a1-bd6b-be574c17ecf9">repeats itself</a>. Even when you demand that it stop repeating itself, it repeats itself.

Has anyone ever asked you, on the social web, what you think about something? Not a message to everyone to which you could reply, but a message specifically to you? I try to do it when I think of it. I find you can get really interesting ideas that way sometimes. And also it's a way spreading some love around the world, because people like to be asked what they think, I've found.

I'm going through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar Galactica</a> for the third time. One of the major themes of the show is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylons">robots</a> that the Capricans created went to war with the humans and almost but not quite wiped them out. Almost every episode is about the conflict between humans and the AIs. It's a fantastic show, the acting and the writing is far beyond most TV series. I'm at the beginning of season 3. I'll let you know if I figure anything out from watching the series again.

Campaign commercial. A picture of Trump at 88. Voiceover: "It's 2035. He's still president. Don't you wish you had a vote? (You don't.)" This message was approved by Uncle Sam and The Founders wondering wtf you were thinking when you voted for him in 2024.

I watched 15 minutes of the playoff game between the Boston team and the Indiana team and found that I only gave the very slightest of fucks. I knew all the players. I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin">Obi Toppin</a>, a former Knick we traded for some reason. That's about it for my inner fan. I turned it off as it went to overtime and looked up the result when I got up in the morning. That's how I like my NBA, frankly.

## 2024-05-12 What to do about the climate?

date: 2024-05-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-to-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What to do about the climate?</h1>

<p>The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way out of this uncertainty? What should or <a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?</p>

<p>Before we even start, let me just say that I&rsquo;m never interested in debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It&rsquo;s real, it&rsquo;s here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.</p>

<p>The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green, on all levels of government. And by &ldquo;green&rdquo; I mean the most radical green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a  one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something about local politics, and so on.</p>

<p>On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we&rsquo;re not sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn&rsquo;t help much against the climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean? How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The oil spills? And here&rsquo;s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop! I need to stop because there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;thinking it through&rdquo; when things are so complex unless you&rsquo;re a scientist working on it. I hope the scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and individuals know what to tackle first.</p>

<p>This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly wrong. They don&rsquo;t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also: get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are precious.</p>

<p>The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I fear.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green">@peterdutoit</a> recently posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order of impact:</p>

<p>🚫 Live car free<br>
🚙 Shift to BEV [i.e. Battery Electric Vehicle]<br>
✈️ One less flight (long return)<br>
☀️ Use renewable energy<br>
🚋 Shift to public transport<br>
🔨 Refurbishment and renovation<br>
🥗 Vegan diet<br>
🆒 Heat pump<br>
⏲️ Improved cooking equipment<br>
♨️ Renewable-based heating</p>

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA. doi: 10.1017/9781009157926.007</li>
</ul>

<p>The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there&rsquo;s an answer if anybody is claiming that we don&rsquo;t know what to do. But also: there&rsquo;s your answer if you&rsquo;re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a very small number of people that have actually read this report, let alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>This is why a public &ldquo;chain of trust&rdquo; needs to lead from interviews with public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance, hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders trust in people.</p>

<p>Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a> right.</p>

<p>(We don&rsquo;t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to go.)</p>

Trump&#8217;s lawyers rested their defense of the former president today, putting an end to the testimony we will hear in the case. Trump did not testify. Trump's refusal to take the stand encapsulates the MAGA approach to politics. Since the 2020 presidential election, he and his surrogates have made repeated accusations and statements about how the system is rigged against them and alleged there is evidence that proves them right.

In the 2015 time frame I had come to the conclusion that the curl logo could use modernization and I was toying with ideas of how it could be changed.

And it turns out that once you have it, it starts solving problems you never thought would be associated with AI. But there it is. You just have to sit down and start playing and you find all kinds of amazing things. But if you don't try it, you'll always be looking at it from the past.

<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/"><i>When Online Content Disappears</i></a> by Athena Chapekis, Samuel Bestvater, Emma Remy and Gonzalo Rivero reports results from this research:<br />
<blockquote>
we collected a random sample of just under 1 million webpages from the archives of <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a>, an internet archive service that periodically collects snapshots of the internet as it exists at different points in time. We sampled pages collected by Common Crawl each year from 2013 through 2023 (approximately 90,000 pages per year) and checked to see if those pages still exist today.<br />
<br />
We found that 25% of all the pages we collected from 2013 through 2023 were no longer accessible as of October 2023. This figure is the sum of two different types of broken pages: 16% of pages are individually inaccessible but come from an otherwise functional root-level domain; the other 9% are inaccessible because their entire root domain is no longer functional.
</blockquote>
Their results are not surprising, but there are a number of surprising things about their report. Below the fold, I explain.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
The Web is an evanescent medium. URLs are subject to two kinds of change:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Content drift</b>, when a URL resolves to different content than it did previously.</li>
<li><b>Link rot</b>, when a URL no longer resolves.</li>
</ul>
The Pew team found link rot in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/">Common Crawl's collections</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul><li><b>A quarter of all webpages that existed at one point between 2013 and 2023 are no longer accessible,</b>
 as of October 2023. In most cases, this is because an individual page 
was deleted or removed on an otherwise functional website.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>For older content, this trend is even starker.</b> Some 38% of webpages that existed in 2013 are not available today, compared with 8% of pages that existed in 2023.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
And in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/">news sites, government sites  and Wikipedia</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>23% of news webpages contain at least one broken link, as do 21% of webpages from government sites.</b>
 News sites with a high level of site traffic and those with less are 
about equally likely to contain broken links. Local-level government 
webpages (those belonging to city governments) are especially likely to 
have broken links.</li>
  <li><b>54% of Wikipedia pages contain at least one link in their “References” section that points to a page that no longer exists.</b></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
There is a long history of research into both phenomena. Content drift is important to Web search engines. To keep their indexes up-to-date, they need to re-vist URLs frequently enough to capture changes. Thus studies of content drift started early in the history of the Web. Here are some examples from more than two decades ago:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=f66149e4bc6109512003acbf844b7f3072c08ca3"><i>The Evolution of the Web and Implications for an Incremental Crawler</i></a>, December 1999.</li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/2.841784"><i>Keeping up with the changing Web</i></a>, May 2000.</li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/775152.775246"><i>A large-scale study of the evolution of web pages</i></a>, May 2003.</li>
</ul>
Link rot is a slower process than content drift, so research into it started a bit later. Here are some examples from more than two decades ago:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/2.901164"><i>Persistence of Web references in scientific research</i></a>, February 2001.</li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.10018"><i>Web page change and persistence—A four-year longitudinal study</i></a>, November 2001.</li>
<li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/602421.602422"><i>The decay and failures of web references</i></a>, January 2003.</li>
<li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1088234"><i>Going, Going, Gone: Lost Internet References</i></a>, October 2003.</li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btg465"><i>404 not found: the stability and persistence of URLs published in MEDLINE</i></a>, January 2004.</li>
</ul>
I have written about this topic <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search/label/link%20rot">many times</a>, first in 2008's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/12/persistence-of-poor-peer-reviewing.html"><i> Persistence of Poor Peer Reviewing</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
I like to cite an example of really bad reviewing that appeared in AAAS <i>Science</i> in 2003.  It was <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1088234">Dellavalle RP, Hester EJ, Heilig LF, Drake AL, Kuntzman JW, Schillin MGLM: Going, Going, Gone: Lost Internet References. <i>Science</i> 2003, 302:787</a>, a paper about the decay of Internet links. The the authors failed to acknowledge that the paper repeated,  with smaller samples and somewhat worse techniques,  two earlier studies that had been published in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/602421.602422"><i>Communications of the ACM</i></a> 9 months before,  and in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/2.901164"><i>IEEE Computer</i></a> 32 months before.  Neither of these are obscure journals. It is particularly striking that neither the reviewers nor the editors bothered to feed the keywords from the article abstract into Google; had they done so they would have found both of these earlier papers at the top of the search results.
</blockquote>
The first surprise is that the Pew report lacks any acknowledgement that the transience of Web content is a long-established problem; like Dellavalle <i>et al</i> it is as if it was a new revelation.<br />
<br />
Even before published research had quantified it, link rot and content drift were well understood and efforts were underway to mitigate them. In 1996 Brewster Kahle had founded the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, the first of several archives of the general Web. Two years later, the <a href="https://lockss.org">LOCKSS Program</a> was the first effort to establish a specialized archive for the academic literature. Both were intended to deliver individual pages to users. A decade later, <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> was set up to deliver Web content in bulk to researchers such as the Pew team; it is not intended as a mitigation for link rot or content drift.<br />
<br />
Although Common Crawl was a suitable resource for their research, the second surprise is that the Pew report describes and quantifies the problem of link rot, but acknowledges none of the multiple, decades-long efforts to mitigate it by archiving the Web and providing users with preserved copies of individual pages.<br />

## Why Tesla FSD is unsafe

date: 2024-05-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/teslaModelY.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Here's what I've learned from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla">owing</a> a Tesla Model Y with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/10/230303.html">Full Self Driving</a>. I don't believe it's safe. It absolutely does require your full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I've seen it do crazy stuff in simple situations. I've seen it panic, basically throw its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That's why you always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because at any moment you could be. You never know when it's going to happen. Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If you're an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don't have to think at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years experience with this connection, then I guess it's probably safe. But not the way it is. </p>
<p>I'm amazed there aren't more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla still promotes this as "self-driving," which it is not. </p>
<p>Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I might still switch to a <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9">Kia EV9</a>, at some point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest Telsa dealer is over an hour away, and the <a href="https://www.romeokia.com/">Kia dealer</a> is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York">Kingston</a> which is practically in the neighborhood. </p>

There is a curious dynamic at work in politics these days. Trump does not appear to be trying to court voters to his standard. If he were, he would be reaching out to Nikki Haley voters and trying to moderate his stances. Instead, he is rejecting her voters and doubling down on extreme positions. Rather than trying to appeal to swing voters, he seems to be trying to whip up his right-wing base to engage in violence on his behalf.

## A post I wrote on Twitter

date: 2024-05-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Here's <a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983">something</a> you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext. Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two parties work with each other, and that never happened. </li>
<li>In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn't wait to figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off, broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.</li>
<li>A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants to layer a new protocol on top of the web -- the Semantic Web. He wanted people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. "show me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20." Like that.</li>
<li>It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn't, it required cooperation. You couldn't just throw together a demo in an afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking minutes). </li>
<li>Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL's Semantic Web. It won't require any cooperation and that's why it will work.</li>
</ol>

## Devices versus focal objects

date: 2024-05-20, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Borgmann opposed devices to what he called focal things. Focal things demand something of us. They require a measure of care, practice, and engagement that devices do not. Our use of them induces our focus, which they invite by design. “The experience of a [focal] thing,” Borgmann also notes, “is always and also a bodily and social engagement [&#8230;]

## IBM Sells Cybersecurity Group

date: 2024-05-20, updated: 2024-05-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>IBM is <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-analytics/ciso-grapple-with-ibm-unexpected-cybersecurity-software-exit">selling</a> its QRadar product suite to Palo Alto Networks, for an undisclosed&#8212;but probably surprisingly small&#8212;sum.</p>
<p>I have a personal connection to this. In 2016, IBM <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/ibm-acquire-resilient-systems/">bought</a> Resilient Systems, the startup I was a part of. It became part if IBM&#8217;s cybersecurity offerings, mostly and weirdly subservient to QRadar.</p>
<p>That was what seemed to be the problem at IBM. QRadar was IBM&#8217;s first acquisition in the cybersecurity space, and it saw everything through the lens of that SIEM system. I left the company two years after the acquisition, and near as I could tell, it never managed to figure the space out...</p>

Delivering the commencement address to the graduating seniors at Morehouse College today, President Joe Biden addressed the nation. After thanking the mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, and all the people who helped the graduates get to the chairs in front of the stage, Biden recalled Morehouse&#8217;s history. The school was founded in 1867 by civil rights leader Reverend William Jefferson White with the help of two other Baptist ministers, the Reverend Richard C. Coulter and the Reverend Edmund Turney, to educate formerly enslaved men. They believed &#8220;education would be the great equalizer from slavery to freedom,&#8221; Biden said, and they created an institution that would make the term &#8220;Morehouse man&#8221; continue to stand as a symbol of excellence 157 years later.

<p>Let’s get the obvious question out the way first: “why?” And I, errr, don’t have a good reason. It’s <a href="/blog/2021/5/3/visiting-the-eu/">not the first time</a> I’ve done a big themed running project, but it’s by far the biggest I’ve <em>ever</em> done.</p>
<p>Second obvious question: “was it a good idea?” Kinda… I really enjoyed running through a lot of the countryside, and for the most part the Thames Path is very easy to run on. It’s also mostly well connected with public transport, which makes the point-to-point nature of the runs manageable. But on the other hand I often spent far more time travelling than running, which made it a much larger time commitment than “just” 20 weekend half marathons.</p>
<p>The best part of this project was seeing the contrast in landscapes and communities across the length of the river. Until now my only familiarity with the Thames was with its murky, curvy path through London or the college boathouses in Oxford.</p>

<p>An interesting historical pattern with the Thames — as with <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713101">many English cities</a> — is that effluence flows downstream and affluence upstream. A lot of this has to do with the Thames’s role in London’s history: for centuries waste water was literally dumped in the river. Land up river became more desirable. It’s no historical accident that the royal court at Hampton Court Palace was far west of the City of London.</p>
<p>Those historical trends are reflected today, even as sewage practices have improved (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-67357566">a little</a>) and London de-industrialised. House prices are twice as high in Richmond-upon-Thames in south-west London than Bexley, in south-east London. Further out of London, on an Essex-bound train I overheard a group of men lamenting the loss of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_men%27s_club">working men’s clubs</a>, an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">third place</a> in their communities, whilst in Oxfordshire I sat near a <em>frightfully</em> posh former Home Secretary concluding with a group of friends that taking the train to a party was a “terrifically smart” decision. (Decisions they made in government weren’t quite so clever.)</p>
<p>Deeper into the country the Thames cuts a path through “green and pleasant” English countryside. Over the course of my 20 runs I developed a newfound appreciation for it. I’ve genuinely come to believe that we’re <em>incredibly</em> fortunate in the UK to be so well connected to so much accessible, open space.</p>

<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesgear">Gear</h2>
<p>I ran with a running vest, a 1.5L Osprey water bladder, a handful of snacks (Clif bars in particular), gels, AirPods, iPhone, and Apple Watch Ultra. I experimented with cheaper water bladders but they’re a false economy: after a few runs they’d start to leak and I’d have to replace them.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Watch was the MVP of all these: I used <a href="https://pedometer.app">Pedometer++</a> to display my planned route and route taken throughout each run. The app supports both OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey tiles; I generally preferred the former as they were clearer on the small display.</p>
<p>For the most part I was following the Thames Path, but I often deviated around it to either explore other countryside or take shortcuts on routes that would otherwise be too long in one go.</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesconditions">Conditions</h2>
<p>I ran mostly in winter and spring 2023 and spring 2024. In the winter months the path was often <em>very</em> muddy, whilst in spring there were sections with very overgrown grass (which was joyless with my hayfever). The Thames burst its banks last year, flooding parts of the path. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-restrictions-and-closures">Environment Agency has pages monitoring current river conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the source of the river the Thames Path is often just a trodden path along the edge of fields. This makes for a very uneven surface: I had to slow down to avoid turning an ankle.</p>
<p>I only ran in the summer once, but even in spring it was often 20º+ and sunny. Most of the route is <em>very</em> exposed: by the end I regularly ran with a baseball cap.</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thameslogistics">Logistics</h2>
<p>I live in London, which made travel to and from each run easy. (Cities in the UK are well connected by rail to London and <em>far</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts">less well to one another</a>.) All in I spent about £400 on train tickets, local buses, and (only twice) taxis. I used a railcard to decrease costs but otherwise I generally optimised for time. I’ve no doubt that booking advance singles, split tickets, or cheaper train lines could reduce the cost by at least £100.</p>
<p>At the end of each run I made a tradition of buying a meal deal (or equivalent) and extra snacks: I spent a further £200 on these.</p>
<p>Between Lechlade, Gloucestershire and Teddington, London the Thames is interrupted by dozens of locks. These locks often have extra facilities for boaters, which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-locks-and-facilities-for-boaters">the Environment Agency lists here</a>. I learned way, way too late (literally at the <em>last</em> lock I ran past) that this often includes drinking water taps that you can use to refill water bottles. A lock keeper recommended running the tap for 30s before using it.</p>
<p>I’ve posted GPX files for all the routes below.</p>

<p>For all the London and Kent routes I took South Western trains, TfL services, or High Speed 1.</p>
<p>The best sections were from Battersea Power Station to Greenwich: you get far more diversity in the built environment on this leg than any other section of the Thames (beyond these points London is mostly just suburbs).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_1_N_Teddington_Lock_to_Barnes_Bridge.gpx">[1/20] Teddington to Barnes Bridge (12.7km)</a>: I started by running west with one of the shortest runs. All of the London sections were very flexible as the Thames path is rarely more than a few hundred meters from a TfL connection. Teddington is the final lock on the River Thames and therefore the start of the “tidal Thames”.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_2_N_Barnes_Bridge_to_Tower_Bridge.gpx">[2/20] Barnes Bridge to Tower Bridge (21.2km)</a>: By far the busiest section as it includes the Southbank. Stopped at Battersea Power Station halfway.</li>

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_4_N_Woolwich_to_Dartford.gpx">[4/20] Woolwich to Dartford (21.4km)</a>: The Thames Path deviates quite far from the River Thames as it’s interrupted by the Darent from the south.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_5_N_Dartford_to_Gravesend.gpx">[5/20] Dartford to Gravesend (20.3km)</a>: This was by far the least pleasant section to run: the sewage treatment plants along the river stink, and the marshes aren’t much better. Gravesend definitely wins “worst place name” of anywhere I went.</li>

<p>For all the Essex routes I took c2c trains from West Ham and Fenchurch Street. I chose to cross to running on the north side of the river and run the Thames Estuary Path instead of the Thames Path as it was <em>far</em> better connected to London.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_6_N_Tilbury_to_Stanford_le_Hope.gpx">[6/20] Tilbury to Stanford-le-Hope (17km)</a>: I ran fairly far inland from the river (the land immediately next to the river was marshy). I wouldn’t recommend this path in winter.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_7_N_Stanford_le_Hope_to_Benfleet.gpx">[7/20] Stanford-le-Hope to Benfleet (19.7km)</a>: This section was again quite muddy when I ran it in early spring 2023. Benfleet Station was my starting connection for the next 2 runs.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_8_N_Canvey_Island_Loop.gpx">[8/20] Canvey Island (23.6km)</a>: I ran a lap of Canvey Island because I’m followed by a group of pedants on Strava who would’ve called me out if I skipped it.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_9_N_Benfleet_to_Southend_on_Sea_completed_the_tidal_Thames_.gpx">[9/20] Benfleet to Southend-on-Sea (12km)</a>: I concluded I’d reached the end of the Thames when I reached a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stone_(riparian)">London Stone</a> at Chalkwell, which marks the end of the Port of London’s Authority. However I continued to Southend-on-Sea because I figured if they’re claiming it’s at the seaside rather than the estuary-side that was good enough for me. Finished with fish and chips and ice cream on the beach.</li>

Although it felt delightfully old-fashioned to cross the river by ringing a bell to call the ferryman, it was still 2023 so he took Apple Pay.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_11_N_Chertsey_to_Windsor.gpx">[11/20] Chertsey to Windsor (22.4km)</a>: Ran past Runnymede, shortly before Windsor Castle, which was the site of the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215.

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_15_N_Pangbourne_to_Wallingford_and_Chorley_.gpx">[15/20] Pangbourne to Wallingford (25.1km)</a>: I ran a lot of this on <a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/the-ridgeway/">The Ridgeway</a> rather than the Thames Path. I originally plotted this route with a plan to take a train back from Wallingford Station … only to discover it was a heritage station with <em>very</em> infrequent services so afterwards I looped back and took a train back to London from nearby Chorley.</li>

The Thames Path crosses the river at Benson Lock but at the time the footbridge was closed; a ferry operated across the river instead. I suffered my worst hay fever reaction ever towards the end of this run so my pace dropped completely and I walked the last few kilometers back to Radley, where I then took a train to Oxford and another back to London.</li>

I’d argue these are the last tourist attractions on the run: the remainder is all through countryside and very small towns. I had virtually no service for the second half of the run which made navigating back to Oxford a bit of a challenge; I eventually walked to the A420 and got a local bus back.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_18_N_Bablock_Hythe_to_Lechlade.gpx">[18/20] Bablock Hythe to Lechlade (33.1km)</a>: The Thames Path switches to the opposite side of the river between Bablock Hythe and Appleton. I believe <a href="https://theferrymaninn.co.uk">the pub at Bablock Hythe</a> operates a ferry service, but at the time I was running it was closed. I therefore took a taxi from Oxford to start this run. St John’s Lock is the final (or first!) lock on the river, about a kilometer downstream from Lechlade. At Lechlade I took a local bus to Swindon and trains back from there.</li>

This was the quietest section: I only saw a handful of walkers and no other runners.</li>

<li><p><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_20_20_Cricklade_to_Thames_Head.gpx">[20/20] Cricklade to Thames Head (22km)</a>: For the final leg through the Cotswolds I didn’t push the pace at all. The Thames Path hugged the river tightly but my route deviated slightly from it. The only challenge I had was when I encountered a herd of cows that took a little too much interest in me for my liking … the correct solution was <em>not</em> to climb through a barbed wire fence but instead to walk around them calmly, which I unfortunately learned the hard way.</p>
<p>By May the spring at Thames Head had dried up, but I instead found the spring that was the current source of the Thames tucked away in some woodland between the A433 and the A429. I wouldn’t recommend doing what I did, which was to wade through the Thames (it was only a few centimeters deep here!), cut myself on a whole bunch of brambles, and then get stung by a bunch of stinging nettles to find it. But on the other hand there was no chance I was going to run 400km and <em>not</em> find the start.</p>
<p>I continued on to Thames Head, the traditional start of the river and of the Thames Path. There I met a friendly group of walkers and runners, most of whom were about to set off down the path in the opposite direction. I considered getting a pint in at the Thames Head Inn nearby, but instead opted to avoid train delays and cancellations so I caught the train back to London from Kemble.</p></li>

<p>The final obvious question: “what’s next?” … A break?! The lesson from this project has been that I don’t mind travel for runs, just so long as the travel doesn’t take significantly more time than the run itself. That said, I’ve definitely got a couple more daft projects in the pipeline…</p>

It should be as easy to block someone as it is to follow them. It would make a statement to trolls and users alike. To users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don't think about it too much, and certainly don't be intimidated into not doing it. It must be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an account but not quite this easy. I think they're probably heading there.

Today the Knicks play a game 7 vs the Indiana team at the Garden. If the Knicks win, they go on to the next round vs the Celtics, starting on Tuesday. If they lose, we relax for four months or so, when it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_NBA_season">starts all over again</a>. With love for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&t=315s">heart of gold</a> team. Either way we win, imho. I know you're not supposed to feel that way, but that's how I feel right now. During the game, if we're losing, based on recent experience I won't like that so much. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

Spent a lovely day today with family and let the world turn without me. Handing tonight&#8217;s letter over to my friend Peter with a photograph of his heralding the summer that is just over the horizon. I&#8217;ll be back at it tomorrow. [Image, &#8220;Moon, Hardwood,&#8221; by Peter Ralston]
