I also created a ChatGPT project with the same code (new feature introduced on Monday). Presumably I can ask it questions about the code. Because I have a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a> file in the GitHub project, ChatGPT understands where I want to take this project. Most amazing, it wrote a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">summary</a> of what it saw in the project. I <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">added that</a> to the GitHub project, of course, and since it was in Markdown, it fit right in with no mods. The power of standards. I love it when things that should work, do. The next step is to implement a feature in the new Bingeworthy that can only be done with an AI bot like ChatGPT. It's such a thrill to be working on this stuff as it's happening. And what a delight that it has an API. I don't mind that I'm paying for it, I love the idea of paying to break down walls to create new things that couldn't have been created before.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

What could journalism do to help the country? Move your shows out into the red territories. Make it a requirement that Chris and Joy, Lawrence or Rachel, if they want to stay on the air, have to broadcast from one of the red states. It could be a large city in a red state. The reason is symbolic and practical. The red state voters wouldn't be such a mystery if you knew some of them from your everyday life. And you might have a few of them on the show. You have some selling to do, the idea you're selling is that you care about the people you don't know.

Maybe they should factor that into their thinking, what kind of relationship would you have with an organization that only cared about what you thought if they needed something very specific from you in that exact moment. Any other time, who are you again? We are without leaders.

## In praise of the hundred page idea

date: 2024-12-17, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

I prefer a lightweight nonfiction book to a detailed tome. I&#8217;m a dilettante of many interests, so my attention for any given topic is more likely to sustain 100 pages than 600. The sweet spot is longer than a longread internet article, but that doesn&#8217;t demand a months-long commitment: a 2-3 hour text. At about [&#8230;]

Sometimes the ideas prove workable and other times they're like the great brainstorms one had with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_boom">cocaine</a> in the 80s, not that I would know, but have heard. Anyway, I was daydreaming about what I'd do with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bingeworthy">Bingeworthy</a> if I was going to continue working on it. I thought about the mode I want to use it in. I want to watch a series that I would like, not that Netflix thinks I'd like, because their idea of what I'd like is bullshit. I find that I'll like almost anything that's rated in the 80s by Metacritic, but really only if the NYT reviewed it well. I'll give almost any NYT <i>critics choice</i> a go. So what I really want in the middle of the Bingeworthy display of a program is 250 words about the program aggregated from various critics as Metacritic does so well. Unfortunately neither Metacritic or the NYT offer an API for this as far as I know. Oh too bad, same old thing. No access to the data where you need it (btw, ideally Bingeworthy would be baked into the TV set, or all the streamers could be played in the context of Bingeworthy). Anyway, then <i>boom</i> it hit me, holy shit the thing I was farting around with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/17.html#a164345">in the outliner</a> could actually do this. Now I'm going to need to be able to call ChatGPT from a Node app.

## Hacking Digital License Plates

date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Not everything needs to be digital and &#8220;smart.&#8221; License plates, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/digital-license-plate-jailbreak-hack/">for example</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Josep Rodriguez, a researcher at security firm IOActive, has revealed a technique to ‚Äújailbreak‚Äù digital license plates sold by Reviver, the leading vendor of those plates in the US with 65,000 plates already sold. By removing a sticker on the back of the plate and attaching a cable to its internal connectors, he&#8217;s able to rewrite a Reviver plate&#8217;s firmware in a matter of minutes. Then, with that custom firmware installed, the jailbroken license plate can receive commands via Bluetooth from a smartphone app to instantly change its display to show any characters or image...</p></blockquote>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I'm farting around with the OpenAI API. I have a nice encapsulation for calls to ChatGPT, one that hides all the tricky stuff, all you need is an apiToken to make it work, something that is available for free. The first place I put it is in an outliner. Basically I can write a question in a headline, click an icon and the response from ChatGPT is placed in a series of sub-heads. Interesting to see that they use Markdown to convey the response. The logical choice. I'm not sure how or if I will use this in my writing, but now I have an idea what it's good for. Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/17/fartingAroundWithOpenAiApi.png">screen shot</a> of a question I asked and the answer. Also the API is very slow. A question like that would be displayed instantly in their app, in my app it takes a half minute. And I have to pay for it, whereas in their app it's all covered by my $20 a month subscription.

Via <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2024/12/weekend-reads-642/">Barry Ritholtz</a> we find this infographic entitled <i>Top Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks</i> showing the best total return over the past 5, 10, 15 and 20 years.

<br />
In each case, Nvidia is the best performing stock, and it is the only stock to appear in all four periods. Sounds great, doesn't it? Why wouldn't you just hold NVDA all the time and be guaranteed to beat the market?<br />

But follow me below the fold for more detail from someone who has been long NVDA for more than three decades..<br />

Alas,  this infographic is deeply misleading because they cherry-picked their data. Nvidia's stock price is extraordinarily volatile. The log plot of NVDA shows that on average over its history every three years it suffers a drop of between 45% and 80%. Fortunately, over the same time it has had much larger rises. Thus when discussing the return for being long NVDA for a period the start and end dates matter a lot.<br />

This table shows the performance of NVDA and the S&amp;P 500 over each of the 5-year periods in the infographic. Over three of the 5-year periods NVDA out-performed the S&amp;P 500, and over the remaining one it under-performed.  By choosing appropriate starting points it is easy to find other 5-year periods when NVDA under-performed the S&amp;P 500. For example, from 8/2007 to 8/2012 NVDA returned -63.7% but the S&amp;P returned -5.6%. Or from 11/2001 to 11/2006 NVDA returned +10.7% but the S&amp;P returned +23.5%.<br />

Although the infographic suggests that the huge out-performance started 20 years ago and has been decreasing, this is misleading for two reasons. First, the infographic's numbers are for the whole 20-year period, not for each 5-year period. Second, they are dominated by the rise in the most recent 5-year period.  The linear plot of NVDA makes it clear that, had the most recent 5-year period been like any of the others, Nvidia would not have been in the infographic at all.<br />
<br />
None of this is financial advice. Nevertheless, Nvidia is a great company, and it is possible to make money in its stock. There are two ways to do it, trading on the stock's volatility, or buying low and being prepared to hold it for many years.<br />
<br />
Remember, past performance is no guarantee of future performance. If NVDA were to repeat the past 5-year return over the next 5 years, it would be around $3,100. To maintain its current P/E of 52.85 it would need annual revenue of around $2.6T.<br />

<p>The level or 'band' of <a href="https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Arm%20SystemReady%20Band">SystemReady SR</a> used by modern Ampere-based arm64 workstations and servers means you can install any out-of-the-box Linux distributions, as long as they provide an arm64-compatible installer.</p>

<p>Ubuntu has some of the most complete support for arm64, so I went to download a Live CD ISO I could flash to a USB stick, to install on my test Thelio Astra. For server installs (with no GUI), either 4k or 64k page sizes, there are easily-findable ISOs:</p>

## Short-Lived Certificates Coming to Let‚Äôs Encrypt

date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Starting <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/11/eoy-letter-2024/">next year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our longstanding offering won&#8217;t fundamentally change next year, but we are going to introduce a new offering that&#8217;s a big shift from anything we&#8217;ve done before&#8212;short-lived certificates. Specifically, certificates with a lifetime of six days. This is a big upgrade for the security of the TLS ecosystem because it minimizes exposure time during a key compromise event.</p>
<p>Because we&#8217;ve done so much to encourage automation over the past decade, most of our subscribers aren&#8217;t going to have to do much in order to switch to shorter lived certificates. We, on the other hand, are going to have to think about the possibility that we will need to issue 20x as many certificates as we do now. It&#8217;s not inconceivable that at some point in our next decade we may need to be prepared to issue 100,000,000 certificates per day...</p></blockquote>
