Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0739 AM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM CENTRAL
IOWA TO NORTHERN/WESTERN ILLINOIS AND EASTERN MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms will be possible this afternoon from central
Iowa to northern/western Illinois and eastern Missouri.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a Rex pattern covering much of
north-central/central North America will transition back toward an
omega configuration, as:
1.  An anticyclone persists over central Canada, and
2.  A pronounced cyclone -- initially centered over NE -- travels
eastward roughly along I-80 to the southern Lake Michigan shore
region around 12Z tomorrow.  By 00Z today, the 500-mb low should be
near DSM.

The corresponding surface low was analyzed at 11Z over northeastern
NE near OFK, with cold front to near an STJ-CNU-SPS-FST line, and
warm front across south-central/southeastern IA to southern IL.  The
low should shift across southern/central IA through the day, nearly
in step with its nearby mid/upper-level counterpart, as the warm
front moves slowly northeastward over eastern IA and western IL.  By
00Z, the triple point should be over west-central/central IL, ahead
of the low, with cold front across southeastern MO, southern AR, and
east through south-central TX.  A separate, quasistationary frontal
zone across north-central FL should move little through most of the
afternoon, then slowly southeastward in response to cyclogenesis
near coastal SC.  That development should be related to the advance
of the mid/upper cyclone across the Midwest/Great Lakes, and
shortwaves traversing the basal cyclonic flow.  While isolated
thunderstorms will be possible along and south of the FL front atop
a richly moist boundary layer, severe potential there should be
muted by lack of stronger shear, lapse rates and lift.

...IA/IL/MO region...
Scattered thunderstorms should develop from midday through the
afternoon in one or two arcs east through southeast of the surface
low, near the occluded/cold fronts.  Activity should form initially
over western parts of the outlook area, then spread north through
east over it.  A marginal tornado threat exists, with any sustained
supercell(s) being the main concern for that, along with isolated
damaging gusts and low-end severe hail.

With abundant clouds and precip areas ongoing over the region and
only slowly shifting away through much of the morning, diurnal
destabilization will be slow to occur, and much of the buoyancy may
arise from a combination of weak warm advection/heating in low
levels and the eastern fringes of cooling aloft preceding the
progressive mid/upper low.  Surface dewpoints commonly in the mid
50s to low 60s F (locally higher) will support a narrow corridor of
MLCAPE in the 300-700 J/kg range immediately preceding the frontal
arc, amidst 25-40-kt effective-shear magnitudes and effective SRH
generally in the 150-250 J/kg range (maximized just east of the
low).  Instability, lift and low-level shear each should diminish
southward over central/eastern portions of MO/IL.  Convective
organization should diminish with eastward extent and time this
evening as well, due mainly to weakening instability.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 AM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The risk of fire spread will remain low across the CONUS on
Saturday. Building high pressure across the western US will keep
winds light where the driest air mass resides, within the
southwestern US and southern Plains on Saturday. Pockets of breezy
northwesterly flow will be possible across the central Plains and
the Great Lakes region. However, cooler temperatures will lead to
higher humidity and overall low risk of fire spread.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE COASTAL CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms appear possible Saturday across parts
of the coastal Carolinas.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A shortwave trough is forecast to move eastward across the OH Valley
and central Appalachians on Saturday, continuing eastward off the
Mid-Atlantic Coast early Sunday morning. Another shortwave trough is
forecast to move from the central Plains towards the Mid-South in
the wake of the lead wave, contributing to a broad area of cyclonic
flow over much of the central and eastern CONUS by early Sunday
morning. 

At the surface, primary low will track close to the lead shortwave
trough, with secondary cyclogenesis anticipated along the Carolina
coast throughout the day. Limited buoyancy, fostered mainly by cold
mid-level temperatures, is anticipated ahead of the primary low as
it moves across the OH Valley and central Appalachians. This limited
buoyancy should keep the overall severe risk low, but enhanced
low/mid-level flow may contribute to damaging gust or two with any
more sustained/robust updrafts, particularly across WV.  

Most guidance suggests the secondary low will track far enough
inland to bring low 70s dewpoints into immediate coastal portions of
the Carolinas. Deepening surface low will support moderate low-level
southeasterly flow across the warm sector. This southeasterly flow
beneath moderate westerly mid-level flow will support robust shear
and the potential for more organized thunderstorms. Despite low 70s
dewpoints, overall buoyancy will be modest, tempered by warm
mid-level temperatures and limited heating. This should limit
overall updraft depth and duration, and is expected to keep the
severe risk isolated. Even so, damaging gusts and/or a brief tornado
are possible with any warm-sector thunderstorms that can mature.

1240 AM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
IOWA...NORTHERN MISSOURI...AND NORTHWEST ILLINOIS...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms will be possible this afternoon over parts of
Iowa, northern Missouri, and northwest Illinois.

...Synopsis...
An upper low will fill as it moves from NE into IA through 00Z, and
toward southern Lake MI by 12Z Saturday. Moderate cyclonic flow
aloft will remain south of the upper low, providing shear and
cooling aloft over much of the lower MO Valley and toward the OH
Valley.

At the surface, low pressure will move east across IA during the
day, and into IL and IN overnight. Mid to upper 50s F dewpoints will
be common south of the low, and east of a cold front surging across
MO and across the Ozarks late in the day. Dewpoints may increase
further into the lower 60s F after 00Z as a warm front lifts north
across IL and IN. While moderate to strong shear will exist with
this upper trough and near the surface low, the severe threat will
be mitigated greatly by lack of appreciable instability.

Elsewhere, mid 70s F dewpoints will remain over much of the FL
Peninsula with a temporary ridge aloft, but drying will occur over
northern parts of the state in closer proximity to surface high
pressure.

...IA...MO...IL...
Elevated thunderstorms will be possible early in the day within a
warm conveyor stretching from the Ozarks into WI, with MUCAPE of a
few hundred J/kg. Behind this activity, a warm sector will develop
from MO into IA ahead of the approaching surface low. Surface
heating combined with cooling aloft will likely result in up to 500
J/kg MLCAPE, centered over IA.

The greatest severe threat appears to be from 20-02Z near the
surface low and arcing southeastward along the cold front, from IA
into northern MO, where low-level convergence will be maximized.
Cool temperatures aloft and expected cellular storm mode may favor
hail to 1.00" diameter, and low-level SRH near the low and warm
front could briefly support a supercell or two with brief tornado
threat before winds veer and the warm-sector quality diminishes.
Otherwise, additional elevated thunderstorms are forecast to spreads
east overnight as far east as OH, supported by weak destabilization.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 AM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Surface low pressure will continue to track across the eastern US on
Friday. A cold front will accompany this feature, extending south
across the Ohio River Valley/Upper Mississippi River Valley and
westward into the central and southern Plains. Post-frontal
northwesterly breezes are forecast across portions of Kansas,
Oklahoma, and northern/central Texas. Across southwestern Texas,
northwesterly breezes will overlap relative humidity reductions to
around 15-20 percent. Recent rainfall across this region has
rendered fuels less receptive to fire spread. Status of fuels and
generally cooler temperatures will mitigate the risk of fire spread
and preclude the need to include highlights.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0946 PM CDT Thu Oct 12 2023

Valid 151200Z - 211200Z

Surface high pressure and associated cooler temperatures will
continue to overspread the Plains states into the southern U.S.,
reinforced by a northwesterly mid-level flow regime through the
extended period. While low-level conditions will be relatively dry,
weaker surface winds and cooler temperatures atop marginally
receptive fuels should limit significant wildfire-spread concerns.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY FROM
EASTERN NEBRASKA AND KANSAS INTO WESTERN IOWA AND NORTHWEST
MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms remain possible this evening mainly over parts
of eastern Nebraska.

...Central Plains...
An upper low will continue to move slowly east across NE through
tonight, with a 70-80 kt midlevel jet pushing east into IA and
northern MO. At the surface, low pressure will fill as it moves east
across the same areas. Storms have generally decreased in intensity
this evening due to the cooling air mass, except for farther south
into east-central KS in closer proximity to the surface warm plume.
00Z soundings downstream indicate minimal instability overall, with
little additional destabilization expected as a cooling boundary
layer counteracts any cooling aloft. Shear will remain strong over
northern areas, but waning instability should limit the overall
severe risk. As such, a Marginal Risk will remain over the area for
sporadic hail in the stronger cells.
