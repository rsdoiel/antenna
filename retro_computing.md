date: 2024-06-18, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>If you're new to FreeDOS and want to install it for yourself, you can install on real hardware or in a virtual machine. We usually recommend a virtual machine, but you can also use an old PC or purchase a new "retro" computer. To install on a virtual machine, you can watch the video about <a class="" href="https://youtu.be/xXkmOwLPpcg?feature=shared" rel="nofollow">How to install FreeDOS on VirtualBox</a> or read this article series: <a class="" href="https://www.both.org/?p=4743" rel="nofollow">How I boot FreeDOS using QEMU</a> {overview} and <a class="" href="https://www.both.org/?p=5612" rel="nofollow">Running FreeDOS on Linux with QEMU</a> {basic setup} and <a class="" href="https://www.both.org/?p=5632" rel="nofollow">How to run DOS apps on Linux</a> {sound setup}, or read our wiki page about <a class="" href="https://wiki.freedos.org/wiki/QEMU" rel="nofollow">installing on QEMU</a>. To learn about running FreeDOS on a classic PC, you can read <a class="" href="https://www.both.org/?p=5690" rel="nofollow">Running FreeDOS on the Pocket386</a> or watch the video <a class="" href="https://youtu.be/2h96UseZs6Q" rel="nofollow">FreeDOS running on real hardware</a> or read our wiki page about <a class="" href="https://wiki.freedos.org/wiki/Pocket386" rel="nofollow">installing FreeDOS on the Pocket386</a>.</p>
