## Free Monad Transfomers from Outer Space

date: 2025-07-25, from: James Hobson blog

This post serves three purposes, one is to plug my new, cool library, next is to talk a bit about free monad transformers and finally, to spread some knowledge and love for the Plan 9 operating system.
Algebraic effects have become my go-to tool when developing new applications and libraries and my usage of monad transformers has fallen to the wayside so it&rsquo;s not a surprised that the two technologies are often presented as in some way competing ways of dealing with effects, but I don&rsquo;t think this is true.

date: 2025-07-21, from: RiscOS Story

If you&#8217;re on certain social media websites, you may have noticed a couple of polls run by RISCOSbits recently. These formed a part of the company&#8217;s research and development, as they decided exactly which direction to take for some new kit that was in the works &#8211; and that new hardware can now be revealed: There are two shiny new toys in the range, both of which are &#8216;companion&#8217; systems designed to work alongside existing RISC OS computers &#8211; with one version of one of the two machines actually intended&#8230;
