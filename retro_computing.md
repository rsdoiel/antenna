## The Biography of a Discovery

date: 2024-11-06, from: Computer History: Stores

<p>One item in a new collection fascinated CHM curator David Brock—an early video recording, made in 1968, with explanatory notes by industrial psychologist Robert Dunlop. The notes told of an inventive computer system at IBM headquarters that Brock had never heard anything about. A demo of the system was captured on the long obsolete video. Could it be restored, and would it change history?</p>

## Kclock’s version number ticks over for the first time

date: 2024-11-04, from: RiscOS Story

Released over twenty years ago, Kclock is a simple clock application by Keven Wells that displays the time and date in a window &#8211; and it has now received its first ever update, making it version 1.01. The main functional change is that for systems running RISC OS 3.50 or later, a button can be pressed to invoke the system date and time configuration. Behind the scenes, another change is that it now uses the latest version of the Dr Wimp BASIC library. If you find any of Kevin&#8217;s software,&#8230;
