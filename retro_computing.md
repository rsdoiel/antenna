## Rollercoaster Tycoon (or, MicroProseâ€™s Last Hurrah)

date: 2025-08-01, from: Digital Antiquarian

This article tells part of the story of MicroProse Software. I think it touches on two of the most fundamental aspects of human nature. We all like doing something constructive, where we can see that we are creating something from virtually nothing, and we all have a desire to nurture or look after things. This [&#8230;]

## Drag'n'Drop 14i4 edition reviewed

date: 2025-07-29, from: Icon Bar, RISC OS News

The Summer edition of Drag'n'Drop magazine is now out (with a suitably loud cover). This edition is 51 pages of news, reviews, tools and lots of code (on yellow pages no less)! As the final edition of Volume 14 (where has the time gone), it includes an updated index including back issues. As it is a PDF you can read it on just about any system (I read it on my IPad).

## So I saw this headline

... and the first thing I thought <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/49ers/article/49ers-cb-deommodore-lenoir-discusses-june-arrest-20788606.php">reading it</a> was, "Is he Deommodore 64?" (No, unfortunately, Deommodore Lenoir's <a href="https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/deommodore-lenoir-49ers-jersey-number-change/1632743/">jersey number is 2</a>, and I'm not even a 49ers fan.)

## VSBHDASF

date: 2025-07-27, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>If you run FreeDOS (or any DOS) on real hardware, you will have problems getting sound to work with DOS games. That's because DOS doesn't have a 'hardware abstraction layer' like modern operating systems; DOS programs talked to the hardware directly, which is why you had to tell each game about your sound card. But since about 1997, PC hardware moved to Intel audio, so games that used SoundBlaster for sound won't work. That's why you need <a class="" href="https://github.com/crazii/SBEMU" rel="nofollow">SBEMU</a> .. or Japheth's fork, <a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/VSBHDA" rel="nofollow">VSBHDA</a> .. to emulate SoundBlaster. Now there's a fork of VSBHDA that "adds support for using soundfonts for MPU-401 emulation using TinySoundFont, and properly fixes it to make it work with games like Duke Nukem 3D." You can find it at <a class="" href="https://github.com/Cacodemon345/VSBHDASF" rel="nofollow">VSBHDASF at GitHub</a>.</p></div>
