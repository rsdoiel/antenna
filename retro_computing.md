## CauseWay DOS extender

date: 2025-02-26, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>Japheth has posted an update to the ancient CauseWay DOS extender (originally written mostly by Michael Devore). A DOS extender lets DOS programs run in a protected mode; CauseWay was originally Watcom's DOS extender, released as open source from Open Watcom. The sources are in Masm v6 syntax, but can be built with Masm/JWasm. Quite a few bugs have been fixed in this release, and DOS conventional memory footprint is significantly lower, especially in DPMI mode. More details at the <a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/CauseWay/releases" rel="nofollow">v5.0 pre3 release</a> page on Japheth's <a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/CauseWay" rel="nofollow">CauseWay GitHub</a> project.</p></div>
