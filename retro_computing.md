## Networking in C64 OS

date: 2024-09-24, from: C64 OS Blog

 <img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.c64os.resources/weblog/commodorenetworkprotocol/icon-cnp.png'> For the last few months I have been super hard at work on the next major update to C64 OS, version 1.07. It will be released as a free update to all licensed users of C64 OS v1.x, and will be made available for download from the C64 OS System Updates page. The big new technology coming to C64 OS is networking. It's been a long time coming, but up until this point there have been many more basic features that had to be completed first. And now I'm very excited to finally be at the point where I can work on the networking layer, which I think will really bust open the doors of what we can do with C64 OS. Along the way I've been implementing a number of smaller items on the list and fixing a bunch of annoying bugs. Here's a short list of some of the updates and improvements that are coming in v1.07: Improved NMI handling and behavior of STOP+RESTORE New Network Utility for configuring C64 OS networking Settings Utility now offers to open the Network Utility TKInput fields gain support for. . .
