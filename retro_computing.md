## Mark Moxon talking to WROCC about Lander – 5th June

date: 2024-06-03, from: RiscOS Story

If your use of RISC OS goes back to the early days of the operating system, there&#8217;s a very good chance you&#8217;ll have either have played Lander or, at the very least, will have found it lurking on one of the discs that came with your computer. It was supplied on the &#8216;Applications Discs&#8217; that came with early Archimedes and A3000 computers. The game was based around a very simple concept: You control a craft called a Lander, and you fly around the protecting your world by eliminating enemy ships&#8230;

## MACadd becomes 2.00

date: 2024-06-03, from: RiscOS Story

Kevin Wells has released a new version of his application for looking up information about MAC addresses from the RISC OS desktop. Version 2.00 of MACadd brings with it a number of changes over the last release. The chief driver of the update is that the provider of the remote application programmer interface (API) that was being used is no longer working with the software, so Kevin has changed the code to support a new one, called MACLookup. Other changes include preventing multiple copies of the software running at once,&#8230;
