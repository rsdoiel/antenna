## The Year of Peak Might and Magic

date: 2025-07-18, from: Digital Antiquarian

This article tells part of the story of New World Computing. Some passions are lifelong, but many others fade away over the course of a life, to be replaced by others. Not long after Jon Van Caneghem, the founder of New World Computing, sold his company to 3DO, it started to become obvious to everyone [&#8230;]

## Web2PDF – a new application from Kevin Wells

date: 2025-07-16, from: RiscOS Story

Kevin Wells has found another remote application programmer interface (API) to make use of for the benefit of RISC OS users, and as a result has released a new application: Web2PDF. Like a lot of Kevin&#8217;s software, Web2PDF makes use of Wget to relay information input into the program&#8217;s RISC OS window to the remote API, and then feed the results back to the user. Usually those results are presented to the user via the application itself, but this time there is a subtle difference. The remote API used by&#8230;

## ArcMouse shrinks into a v2 form

date: 2025-07-16, from: RiscOS Story

Some time back, Karl Clark released ArcMouse, an interface that could be plugged in to the mouse port on Archimedes-era ARM-based computers from Acorn and allowed a more standard USB mouse to be used. Karl has now improved on the design, and has launched ArcMouse version 2. The new design is that at just 12mm wide, it&#8217;s notably smaller than the older version, which makes it more compatible with the &#8216;all in one&#8217; style of RISC OS computer from Acorn (such as the A3000, on which the mouse port is&#8230;

## NetMount client 1.5.0 and server 1.4.1

date: 2025-07-14, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>If you need to transfer data between DOS and another system, here's another option: NetMount enables DOS systems to access shared directories from remote machines as if they were local drives. It operates over the UDP protocol. It has two parts: <code>netmount</code> that runs on the DOS client, and <code>netmount-server</code> that runs on Linux, Mac, or Windows. The source code is available at <a class="" href="https://github.com/jrohel/NetMount" rel="nofollow">NetMount on GitHub</a> and is available under the GNU GPL. NetMount <a class="" href="https://github.com/jrohel/NetMount/releases/tag/client-v1.5.0%2Cserver-v1.4.1" rel="nofollow">client 1.5.0 and server 1.4.1</a> were released a few days ago, and include several fixes.</p></div>
