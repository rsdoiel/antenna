## NetMount client 1.5.0 and server 1.4.1

date: 2025-07-14, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>If you need to transfer data between DOS and another system, here's another option: NetMount enables DOS systems to access shared directories from remote machines as if they were local drives. It operates over the UDP protocol. It has two parts: <code>netmount</code> that runs on the DOS client, and <code>netmount-server</code> that runs on Linux, Mac, or Windows. The source code is available at <a class="" href="https://github.com/jrohel/NetMount" rel="nofollow">NetMount on GitHub</a> and is available under the GNU GPL. NetMount <a class="" href="https://github.com/jrohel/NetMount/releases/tag/client-v1.5.0%2Cserver-v1.4.1" rel="nofollow">client 1.5.0 and server 1.4.1</a> were released a few days ago, and include several fixes.</p></div>
