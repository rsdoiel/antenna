Having software to run on your RISC OS computer is all well and good &#8211; but every one knows the most important type of software of all is the type that entertains, and engages in an interactive way: Games Even if you don&#8217;t play computer games yourself, and might want to sit down with a spreadsheet, or while away the hours with a word processor, there&#8217;s a good chance you have family members who would prefer to just play. So here&#8217;s a quick round up of possible sources of computer&#8230;

## New show, old kit? Retro exhibitors at RISC OS North

date: 2025-03-26, from: RiscOS Story

The list of exhibitors lined up for RISC OS North isn&#8217;t limited to just the world of modern RISC OS computing. Some will also cater to older platforms &#8211; and that doesn&#8217;t just mean older RISC OS platforms. If you have an Acorn Electron, for example, you should make your way to the Retro Hardware stand, where you&#8217;ll be able to find &#8220;all things Electron&#8221;. For slightly newer machines, Retro Hardware will also have a 32-bit DMA EIDI hard drive interface for A7000, A7000+, and RiscPCs &#8211; and some software,&#8230;

## It’s a software pick ‘n’ mix at RISC OS North

date: 2025-03-25, from: RiscOS Story

As with any computer system, when using RISC OS you&#8217;ll need software to run on it &#8211; and you&#8217;ll be certain to have some already. As an existing user you&#8217;ll have built up a collection of applications you use, and may want to add to it. And as a new user you&#8217;ll have discovered that there is some supplied with the operating system &#8211; though how much depends on how you got started &#8211; and you almost certainly will want to add to it. So where do you go for&#8230;

## Xcopy version 1.8b

date: 2025-03-23, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>Xcopy is a standard DOS command that copies a directory tree. Jeremy has fixed several bugs in Xcopy and has released version 1.8b. Fixed this release: rework recursive xcopy to not use as much stack space,  increase stack size when built with Open Watcom, and the <em>listmode</em> '/L' option should not create directory structure (only simulate). Get the new version from Jeremy's <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/xcopy" rel="nofollow">Xcopy at GitHub</a> or download directly from the <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/xcopy/releases/tag/v1.8b" rel="nofollow">version 1.8b release</a>. We've also mirrored a copy of this version in the FreeDOS Files Archive at Ibiblio, under <a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/xcopy/1.8/" rel="nofollow">/files/dos/xcopy</a>.</p></div>

## Move version 3.4

date: 2025-03-23, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>Jeremy has released an updated version of the FreeDOS Move command, which <em>moves</em> a file or directory from one place to another. Version 3.4 has an update to limit stack usage reducing chance of stack overflow on recursive moving (using the <code>/S</code> option). You can find it at Jeremy's <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/move" rel="nofollow">Move on GitHub</a>, or more directly from the <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/move/releases/tag/v3.4" rel="nofollow">version 3.4 release</a>.

## New Pinboard 2.07 and Iris 1.031 from RISC OS Developments

date: 2025-03-23, from: RiscOS Story

RISC OS Developments are behind the next announcement in my queue, so over to Richard and Andrew for this joint announcement: RISC OS Developments is pleased to announce the release of two new software updates ahead of the RISC OS North show next weekend. Pinboard 2.07 Pinboard 2.07 is the latest version of the enhanced Pinboard/desktop which we launched last year. It adds the ability to &#8220;iconise&#8221; sticky notes so that they don&#8217;t take as much desktop space, and improves saving of stickies for more natural behaviour. Occasional icon drift&#8230;

## Pi 5 comes to RCi’s Hydra and N.Ex.T

date: 2025-03-23, from: RiscOS Story

Another announcement from Andrew Rawnsley of R-Comp, this time with his RCi hat on: We are pleased to announce that Pi 5 technology is now available in our Hydra computers, and as an optional add-on for N.Ex.T boxes. The 64-bit only Pi 5 offers a significant performance boost over the previous generation, with improvements to processing, but also storage and general server capabilities. As such, it offers a noticeable upgrade to the Hydra, making additional heads both faster and smoother, as well as improving file sharing performance. Sadly RISC OS&#8230;

## PhotoDesk 3.24 – available now

date: 2025-03-23, from: RiscOS Story

It&#8217;s now less than a week until the inaugural RISC OS North show, and that means two things. Firstly, things are hectic here in the bunker as I prepare for the show myself &#8211; and to make matters worse, I will be temporarily relocating the bunker. And let me tell you, that is not an easy task. Secondly, it means all the announcements start landing in my inbox. To save time, I&#8217;ll be posting them as received, rather than writing about them. Here&#8217;s the first in my queue, from R-Comp:&#8230;

## User groups at RISC OS North

date: 2025-03-23, from: RiscOS Story

As well as shows like RISC OS North, a good way to support the operating system is to attend your local user group &#8211; and a few will be represented at this event: The Wakefield RISC OS User Group (WROCC) is a particularly notable one. It was WROCC that organised the Wakefield Show and, with it not possible this year for them to run it again, they have chosen to sponsor this event. They hold regular online meetings (so being local to them isn&#8217;t an issue), with guest speakers, and&#8230;
