## Power Mac G5 Quad – Which is Faster, PC2-3200U-288 or PC2-4200U-444 RAM?

date: 2025-06-24, from: Happy Macs site

I have always wondered whether equipping your Power Mac G5 Quad with PC2-4200U-444 RAM would make for a faster machine than if the same machine were equipped with PC2-3200U-288 RAM. It seems obvious that the faster RAM ought to make for a faster machine, but as we shall see in a moment, it doesn&#8217;t really [&#8230;]

Being from R-Comp, it&#8217;s a RISC OS computer first and foremost &#8211; that&#8217;s the operating system running on the &#8216;first&#8217; head, while any of the others that are in use (the full six don&#8217;t have to be enabled) would most likely be&#8230;

## Converting a Power Mac G5 Quad to Air Cooling – An A-Z Guide

date: 2025-06-22, from: Happy Macs site

The Achilles heel of most late 2005 Power Mac G5 Quads is the Liquid Cooling System (LCS), a largely invisible part of the G5 Quad, tucked discretely behind the shiny G5 face plate you will see when you open up your Quad.
