## WROCC to perform some NICanatomy â€“ 8th January

date: 2025-01-03, from: RiscOS Story

The Wakefield RISC OS Computer Club (WROCC) usually meets on the first Wednesday of each month, with the occasional exception. One such change often happens in January, when the regular day is often very close to New Year&#8217;s Day &#8211; and it doesn&#8217;t get much closer than it did this year. The group&#8217;s first meeting will therefore take place on Wednesday, 8th January &#8211; a week later &#8211; at which they will be using one of Elesar Ltd&#8217;s NIC designs as a case study to follow the process that leads&#8230;

## Look up bank information

date: 2025-01-03, from: RiscOS Story

A new piece of software &#8211; BankInfo &#8211; has been released by Kevin Wells, following his tried and trusted approach of using Wget as an interface between the RISC OS desktop and a web-based application programmer interface (API). The new application makes use of the remote API at Bank Data, and provides a way to look up basic information about banks from a selection of source data. You can input one of the following to perform a lookup: International Bank Account Number (IBAN). SWIFT code, sometimes called a Bank Identifier&#8230;

And thanks to everyone who contributes to FreeDOS, we are excited to share the <strong>FreeDOS 1.4 Release Candidate 1 is now available!</strong> This has a ton of new changes and fixes since FreeDOS 1.3. This includes updates to the installer and version updates on many programs including fdisk, format, jemm, ldebug, bwbasic, dojs, dog, nasm, curl, mkeyb, edlin, blocek, htmlhelp, fdnet, more, fdimples, .. the list goes on - read the <a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/test/changes.log" rel="nofollow">change log</a> for the complete list.

## FreeCOM 0.86

date: 2025-01-01, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>Jeremy Davis and others have been working to update FreeCOM (the FreeDOS <em>command.com</em> shell) and have released <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/freecom/releases/tag/com086" rel="nofollow">FreeCOM version 0.86</a>. Thanks to everyone who has helped with this version - including Jeremy (maintainer) and contributors TK Chia, Bitigchi, Andrewbird, Joshux, Boeckmann, and Jmalak. This has a bunch of new fixes and additions, too many to list here - please see the release notes for full details. You'll also find a bunch of translations including Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukr. For each language supported, a zip archive is provided with the following versions: <strong>xms-swap</strong> with XMS-only swap support (for computers with lots of memory and an XMS manager), <strong>kswap</strong> for basic swapping support (for 8086/8088 computers), <strong>plainedt</strong> without command line editing, and <strong>debug</strong> with debug information added.</p>
<p>We've also mirrored FreeCOM 0.86 in the <a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/" rel="nofollow">FreeDOS Files Archive</a> at Ibiblio, under <a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/command/0.86/" rel="nofollow">/dos/command/0.86</a>. To install this on your existing FreeDOS system, unzip the file for your preferred language. To test it, just run the <em>command.com</em> you want to use. To make it a permanent replacement for your FreeDOS system, edit the SHELL= line in your <em>fdconfig.sys</em> to point to the new version.</p></div>
