## JWasm 2.19

date: 2025-01-27, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>If you're following along with the latest development tools, you may be interested in JWasm, a MASM-compatible assembler. Version 2.19 was released today and includes several bugfixes and other changes. A few highlights: format mz: stack segment was never written, format mz,pe: start offset for first segment may have resulted in an invalid binary, write listing reworked, PUSHW will emit warning "magnitude of offset exceeds 16-bit" if operand is a 32-bit offset, and using 'option oldmacros' will cause a warning only. You can find it at <a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/JWasm" rel="nofollow">JWasm on GitHub</a>, under <a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/JWasm/releases/tag/v2.19" rel="nofollow">release v2.19</a>. We've also mirrored this in the FreeDOS Files Archive at Ibiblio, under <a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/devel/asm/jwasm/2.19/" rel="nofollow">/devel/asm/jwasm</a></p></div>
