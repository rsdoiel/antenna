## Upgrading PowerMac G5 with 2 TB HDD

date: 2024-09-14, from: Happy Macs site

I recently pgraded my PowerMac G5 DP 2.3 GHz with a WD Blue 2 TB HDD (spinner, not SSD). I had not planned to post about it, but the results were impressive enough that I thought I should pass them on. Upgrading an HDD is a fairly low impact way to achieve significant performance improvements. [&#8230;]

date: 2024-09-14, from: Happy Macs site

Post Body: In a recent post, I introduced AquaFox, a revived TenFourFox-based PPC web browser.

## AquaFox, A Great New G3, G4, G5 Browser

date: 2024-09-14, from: Happy Macs site

In the 17 years since Apple stopped sales of the last PowerPC Macintoshes in favor of Intel equivalents, PowerMac enthusiasts have kept the platform alive with regular software updates, new apps and more.

## Bristol RISC OS Users meeting – 12th September

date: 2024-09-09, from: RiscOS Story

The next meeting of Bristol RISC OS Users (BRU) will take place on Thursday, 12th September. The group meets on an informal basis for a chat over a meal, a drink and bite to eat, so there is usually no set topic or formal speaker; it&#8217;s usually a case of discussing the latest RISC OS news and developments, and often beyond into the wider world. However, sometimes members might bring along their own latest projects &#8211; or problems &#8211; for the group to look at, and this month Chris Hall&#8230;

The application offers a handy way to check if an entity that is charging either Value Added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST) in those countries is legitimately registered. If they are, they should provide a registration number, and&#8230;
