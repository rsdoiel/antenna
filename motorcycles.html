<h2 id="ai-tutoring-what-works">AI tutoring; what works?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Herman Bear Blog</p>
<p>
It’s 2024 and LLMs are still the “hot new thing”. Looking back on 2023,
I’m surprised how quickly I went from, “Wow! My computer is speaking to
me in fluent and comprehensible English,” to, “Eh, that could have been
phrased/executed/generated better.”
</p>
<p>
Back in the early 2010s, my mother created and ran a non-profit project
called Dr Math. This used volunteer students from the University of
Pretoria as math tutors via Mxit (the mobile IM popular in South Africa
at the time, running over WAP).
</p>
<p>
The infrastructure was fairly simple. Volunteers would use a computer at
the institute loaded with software that allowed them to tutor multiple
students at once. They’d do this after school hours into the early
evening, giving students whose parents couldn’t or wouldn’t help them
with their homework a helpful nudge in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
And it worked pretty well! Within a few years, Dr Math had tens of
thousands of students all over the country using the service for help
with their math homework, studies, and exam prep. And all for free.
</p>
<p>
For those who don’t know, South Africa is a country of contrasts. There
is extreme poverty and extreme wealth living side by side. If you fall
within the lucky ~20% of the population, your lifestyle looks something
akin to Europe or certain parts of the USA, but at a much lower cost of
living.
</p>
<p>
The majority of the population suffers from poor service delivery and
other socioeconomic problems, with education falling way behind the
developed world. It’s like two distinct countries overlaid on one.
</p>
<p>
And this was where Dr Math fit in.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t supposed to be “the perfect education tool”. Instead, it was a
step up. A foot in the door for those students who were the most
underserved.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, due to some government-funded institution bureaucracy,
the project was shuttered once my mother left the institute, and the
whole project ground to a sad halt.
</p>
<p>
It has been sitting at the back of my mind ever since, and with the
release of the GPT 3.5 API, the idea of using it to tutor maths (and
later other subjects) with the Socratic method was the perfect catalyst
to reignite this project.
</p>
<p>
The prototype of the project, built in collaboration with my mother and
a friend (now business partner), used GPT 3.5 with two agents watching
one another to make sure the conversation didn’t go off track (this was
before the easily steerable and much more powerful 4 came out). This
prototype allowed us to get all the infrastructure in place and test our
assumptions until gaining access to the GPT 4 API. We hooked the chatbot
(Prof Pi, later <a href="https://botsy.org" target="_blank">Botsy</a>)
up to WhatsApp and ran a few pilot projects.
</p>
<p>
There are a few reasons we chose WhatsApp:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Smartphone penetration is great in Africa, and even inexpensive phones
have WhatsApp pre-installed here
</li>
<li>
WhatsApp is used as the de facto means of communication throughout
Africa
</li>
<li>
Some cellular service providers zero-rate WhatsApp data, making using
the service completely free to the end user
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And incredibly enough, this worked as well. Arguably better than human
text-based tutors (although more on that later). While LLMs in general
are not great at calculations (this issue has since been mostly solved
with code-interpreter), using the Socratic method of teaching meant the
onus was on the student to do the calculations with the tool prompting
them and helping them along. LLMs are also infinitely patient, unlike
human tutors, and so would stay cheery and online, helping even the most
frustrating of students.
</p>
<p>
We had multiple pilot projects running throughout Sub-Saharan Africa.
There were 2 large high-school cohorts and a university-level cohort in
Tanzania, and an interesting and tragic cohort at a University in North
Sudan.
</p>
<p>
The latter pilot was based in Khartoum, and it happened to be running
when the unrest started and students couldn’t leave their houses due to
shooting in the streets. Many used our tool as their sole means of
studying during this time, asking it to generate practice problems, as
well as discussing concepts and exploring the curriculum material. All
this in fluent Arabic.
</p>
<p>
There are many things we learned about AI tutors during this time. But a
few are fairly novel.
</p>
<p>
They say that you can give a sufficiently motivated student a library
card and they will become a physicist. But most students with library
cards aren’t physicists.
</p>
<p>
This holds true for AI tutors as well. While they are a fantastic tool
for assisted learning, they only have the ability to <em>respond</em>.
They are unable to engage a student. Instead, the AI tutor may assist or
prompt them, leaving the responsibility of learning on the student and
their personal reserve of motivation.
</p>
<p>
One of our other pilot projects partnered with a South African eLearning
company that provided low-cost, live video lessons. The AI tutor shone
in this particular case since it complemented the classes instead of
trying to stand-alone as an education tool. The teachers would act as
the prompter, providing the content and structure of the lesson. The AI
tutor would then act as a teaching assistant, helping students who were
stuck in understand concepts and work through problems.
</p>
<p>
We also had a few discussions about whether we needed to explicitly
state, “This is a chatbot”. On the one hand, there are the ethical
implications of AI impersonating real people, which is dishonest. On the
other, when students knew they were speaking to an AI instead of an
actual human, many would try to game the system to get it to do their
homework for them.
</p>
<p>
This was mostly impossible with a sufficiently good prompt. However, the
relationship between the tutor and the student would degrade. In a few
cases, we would even see students “mistreat” (if you can call it that)
the AI, calling it names and being mean and demanding.
</p>
<p>
I don’t believe in AI’s ability to feel (yet). However, it’s the spirit
of the thing that bothered me, and it obviously wasn’t good from a
learning standpoint.
</p>
<p>
That being said, the vast majority of students used the bot as intended,
and we are confident in the learning outcomes and assistance it
provides.
</p>
<p>
We’re currently working with a non-profit in South Africa, trying to
make the tutor bot generally available to as many underserved students
as possible.
</p>
<p>
We’re also in the process of exploring other ways AI tutoring can be
used in education. If you’re interested in having a conversation with
