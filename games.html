Horror Stories, Family Guy’s Halloween special, and more new TV for your
week</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Halloween is nearly upon us; if you are the sort of person who
partakes, it’s possible that Halloween parties already are looming. And
when you’re not figuring out your costumes (or, depending on the level
of craft you’re putting into making your costume, when you are), there’s
a real lineup of spooky-themed programming this week […]</p>

new Destiny game set in an alternate timeline is coming to mobile</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Bungie’s Destiny franchise is coming to a new platform with Destiny:
Rising, a new entry designed for for mobile platforms. The free-to-play
sci-fi RPG shooter will be a “brand-new adventure set in an alternate
Destiny timeline,” developer and publisher NetEase said in a news
release, with a narrative that explores the franchise’s post-Dark Age
era. […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>I am not a woman with a sword, and I don’t live in a soft, watercolor
world that’s quickly being overcome by dark, spindly shadows. But I feel
like I do. Most days are a fight as I slash back at the abyss that
threatens to overwhelm; I have a lot more in common, right […]</p>

ReFantazio’s music is canonically all in the hero’s head — and now I’m
in my head about it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Back in April, as part of a promotional video about Metaphor:
ReFantazio, the game’s director Katsura Hashino quietly dropped a fact
(via translator) that has haunted me ever since: “The music you hear in
game is in the protagonist’s head.” On screen while he talks, there’s a
scene depicted of the main character’s tiny fairy […]</p>

Pokémon Go?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Shroomish, the Mushroom Pokémon from Hoenn, can be found in the wild
in Pokémon Go. Yes, Shroomish can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Shroomish and
Breloom both turn a lovely clear orange and yellow when shiny. Breloom
is both usable in some PvP leagues and as a fighting-type attacker in
PvE. Not bad, mushroom with hands. […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>I’ve had a few friends ask me what I think of The Penguin, HBO’s
spinoff miniseries based in the setting of Matt Reeves’ The Batman, and
to all of them I’ve said: “I mean, it’s a good crime show, and there’s
nothing wrong with that, but, like… what am I doing here?”  That is,
“What […]</p>

<p>Do you feel that? That chill in the air, that tingling sensation at
the back of your neck? It can only mean one thing. That’s right:
Halloween season is once again upon us! Here at Polygon, we love horror.
We cover it all year round, whether it’s ranking the scariest new
releases of the year […]</p>

Revenant</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>A number of Exotics were introduced in Destiny 2, Revenant. As of act
1, there are at least three armor Exotics and two weapons. And while a
surprise Exotic could always pop up, we know for certain that an Exotic
mission will be available sometime during Revenant — likely in act 3,
like in Echoes. […]</p>

Destiny 2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Ice Breaker returns in Destiny 2 as part of Oct. 2024’s Revenant Act
I. The exotic sniper rifle from the first Destiny has been one of the
most glaring omissions when it comes to returning weapons, and while it
doesn’t quite offer infinite ammo anymore, it has a new trait and perk
in keeping with […]</p>

<p>Vesper’s Host is a Destiny 2 dungeon arriving alongside Oct. 2024’s
Revenant Act I. Much like the Deep Stone Crypt, it involves exploring a
Braytech facility above Europa, and players familiar with that raid will
feel right at home with that location and its shared mechanics. There
are four encounters to tackle here, with two […]</p>
