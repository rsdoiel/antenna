finally singing in a Wicked trailer!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, updated: 2024-10-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Wicked is one of the most famous and successful musicals of all time,
with iconic songs like “Defying Gravity,” “Popular,” and “For Good”
transcending beyond musical theater. Based on the 1995 fantasy novel by
Gregory Maguire, itself inspired by The Wizard of Oz (both the movie and
the original novel), Wicked is the origin story […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-09, updated: 2024-10-08, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Since her first tomb-raiding adventure nearly 30 years ago, Lara
Croft has trotted the entire globe in pursuit of artifacts and
international threats. So where does one even begin crafting a new Tomb
Raider story, told entirely in unplayable animation? Showrunner Tasha
Huo had a vision — and Netflix bought in.  “Obviously you can start

<p>This year marks the 10th anniversary of The Game Awards, and in that
time Geoff Keighley’s annual event has established itself quite firmly
as the leading awards ceremony for the game industry — the Oscars of
gaming. It remains promotionally overstuffed to the point that it’s

<p>Amazon’s October Prime Day is a great opportunity to save on big

affordable gadgets that can make life a bit easier. One such example is
a compact fold-up keyboard, which we think should be part of any Steam

<p>date: 2024-10-09, updated: 2024-10-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Konami’s Silent Hill series is famously inspired by film and pop
culture, as proven by the first game’s strong Kindergarten Cop
influence. But one specific ’90s reference in Silent Hill 2 has been
fascinating fans for more than 20 years: the game’s
Christina-Aguilera-at-the-1999-Teen-Choice-Awards connection. Maria, one
of Silent Hill 2’s antagonists, is clearly modeled after […]</p>

<p>Discounts on the PlayStation Portal, Sony’s remote player for the PS5

<p>Amazon’s October Prime Day is now underway, and it’s full of great

<p>Red Dead Redemption is headed to Windows PC on Oct. 29, Rockstar

<p>Todd Phillips’ Joker sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, is catching flak

versions of longtime Batman villain Joker, and what fans thought they
were seeing in the earlier film. But that lack of fidelity should be the

<p>It’s typical for Sony to knock an extra $50 or so off its headphones
