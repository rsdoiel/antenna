of the Year 2025 predictions: The front-runners and challengers to

<p>date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The 11th Game Awards, scheduled for Dec. 11, are suddenly wide open.
Grand Theft Auto 6, which was previously expected to dominate the Awards
this year, has been delayed into 2026. That will make for a much less
predictable Game of the Year competition at the leading awards ceremony
for the game industry — the […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Tony Hawk’s been skating professionally for more than 40 years, and
he doesn’t mind his fans being nostalgic for earlier parts of his
career. If those fans want more remasters and remakes of past Tony Hawk
games, including Tony Hawk’s Underground, he’s more than happy to give
them what they want — if it’s within his […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Crispy critters, Atomic Heart is officially a franchise. Formally
announced at Summer Game Fest 2025 (alongside the tie-in MMO The Cube),
Atomic Heart 2 portrays a new and improved Facility 3826 — a
Soviet-Silicon Valley surrounded by flying cities and inhabited by
scientists who, for some reason, are… sending whales to the moon? Eager

<p>Honkai: Star Rail’s patch 3.4 is coming soon, and this one has a lot
of highly anticipated new stuff. This patch has the Fate/Stay Night
collaboration, as well as buffs for old characters, so it’s going to be
a pretty good one! Below, we explain when Honkai: Star Rail maintenance
starts and ends, alongside the […]</p>

<p>Tophat Gudetama hides in a different spot in Hello Kitty Island
Adventure every week, with new weeks beginning on Monday. Pochacco will
task you with finding this dapper Gudetama specifically as part of a
quest per week for the first two weeks (“The Laziest Egg” and “The

<p>Project Hail Mary, an adaptation of the science fiction novel of the
same name from The Martian writer Andy Weir, is set to be released on
March 20, 2026, but Amazon MGM Studios has already shared a full trailer
for the film. Rather than mostly focusing on Matt Damon growing potatoes
on Mars, the movie […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s been more than a year since Marvel Animation revived X-Men: The
Animated Series in all of its splashy operatic 2D glory. X-Men ’97 was a
triumph, not just in the Marvel canon but in an entire year of TV. As
the producers and artists behind the series explain in the new book

<p>Wizards of the Coast uses the Unearthed Arcana playtest series to
test reactions to proposed new content for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Some
of these ideas never make it into a book, and some are published with
only slight tweaks. But the backlash to the proposed new version of the
Warlock subclass Hexblade released in May […]</p>

<p>Balatro is one of the (many, many) games marked down for Steam’s
annual summer sale. Take it from me: Picking up Balatro on sale — no
matter how big or small the discount — is one of the safest bets you can
make. As someone who couldn’t tell a flush from a full house but could

<p>Pokémon Go is giving away handfuls of free Crowned Sword Energy and
Crowned Shield Energy via codes ahead of Pokémon Go Fest Global 2025.

<p>In the new horror sequel M3GAN 2.0, the killer robot doll from the
first movie meets the memes where they live. She gets taller and faster
and more fashion-forward; she flies through the air in a high-tech
wingsuit; she sings Kate Bush; and, with a self-consciousness that
threatens to ruin the bit, she goes on […]</p>
