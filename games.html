if every movie with a grim ending got a Speak No Evil-style remake?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Christian Tafdrup’s taut 2022 Danish horror movie Speak No Evil
(streaming on Shudder) has one of the all-time bleak movie endings, a
sequence designed to stick in viewers’ memories and haunt their dreams.
James Watkins’ 2024 English-language remake approaches that ending… and
then adds another half-hour or so of cathartic run-and-gun action,
leading up to […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>50 years ago, Ernő Rubik invented his first working prototype of the
Rubik’s Cube, the irrepressible little shifting box that is still a
mainstay for puzzle fans around the world. And out now, there’s a new
free-to-play mobile game with the inventor’s stamp of approval, titled
Rubik’s Match, developed by Nørdlight Games. “Puzzles have always

<p>date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The journey to create the 2024 version of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons
Player’s Handbook has been long and almost comically rocky. Where to
even begin… Should we start with the OGL debacle, an attempted rug-pull
that would have irrevocably damaged the franchise’s biggest third-party
creators? Should we instead focus on the gutting layoffs that came

<p>Flappy Bird has officially returned, now playable on Telegram — but
things aren’t exactly soaring for the 10-year-old viral game. The Flappy
Bird Foundation, which describes itself as a “new team of passionate
fans committed to sharing the game with the world,” announced Thursday
that it was reviving Flappy Bird. The original game, first released

<p>When I’m hunting for a new charging device — either to buy myself or
to recommend to Polygon readers for their Steam Decks, Switch, phone, or

portable charger adds some welcome expressiveness to the until-now
boring business of recharging your gadgets. Once […]</p>

<p>We already have our first information on Sony’s inevitable
PlayStation 6: It will run on AMD chips, according to a report from
Reuters, with chipmaker Intel having lost the bid to manufacture chips
for the next-gen PlayStation. One factor that reportedly led to Sony

<p>Author John Jackson Miller has waited his entire life to play in the
sandbox of Tim Burton’s Batman. Good news: some dreams do come true.
Miller’s new book, Batman: Resurrection, picks up right where the 1989
film left off, finding a clever way to bring Clayface, a member of
Batman’s classic rogues gallery, into Burton’s […]</p>

Xianzhou Luofu is the third area you’ll arrive in, and it has a whole

<p>If you ever stumble across some genuinely interesting data about how
much money a video game has made, you can be sure you’re not supposed to

<p>One fateful college weekend, ActionMax, the genre spinoff of Cinemax,
programmed three down-and-dirty action films in a back-to-back marathon
