Halloween Countdown: 31 days of horror to watch</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, updated: 2024-10-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Do you feel that? That chill in the air, that tingling sensation at
the back of your neck? It can only mean one thing. That’s right:
Halloween season is once again upon us! Here at Polygon, we love horror.
We cover it all year round, whether it’s ranking the scariest new
releases of the year […]</p>

the 4th Southern Reach book, Absolution, burst out of author Jeff
VanderMeer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, updated: 2024-10-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Jeff VanderMeer’s new novel Absolution works as both a prequel and a
sequel to his “Southern Reach trilogy” — appropriate, considering the
slippy, surreal lineage of Annihilation, Authority, and Acceptance. Only
one thing is really certain: The book is a vibe. It’s been 10 years
since VanderMeer dropped readers into Area X, a warped version of

<p>date: 2024-10-22, updated: 2024-10-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Early last week gaming outlets all over published their reviews of
MechWarrior 5: Clans, and while Polygon was not among them, it’s not for
lack of trying. Over the last few months I’ve run up against some
hardware difficulties thanks to my bruised and battered gaming laptop.
Not unexpected, mind you, but deeply inconvenient when […]</p>

<p>Japanese Rural Life Adventure is what it says on the tin — it’s a

<p>Despite being one of only two movies Quentin Tarantino said he would
have paid to see in theaters during the pandemic, Unhinged feels like a
