<p>Players, rejoice: Nintendo Switch 2 restocks are going down at Best
Buy on Thursday, July 17. The great Switch 2 restocking is in-store only

<p>date: 2025-07-14, updated: 2025-07-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The revamped DC Universe has finally made its theatrical debut with
Superman, starring David Corenswet, releasing to majorly positive
reviews and setting a new box office record for live-action Supes films.
But amid the Man of Steel’s return, fans couldn’t help but wonder when
his foil, Batman, would get his own movie set in the […]</p>

<p>Lots of action and hot days on the beach await in Zenless Zone Zero’s
patch 2.1 “The Impending Crash of Waves.” This patch brings not only the
high energy of summer, but also two new characters, new places to

<p>Bring out the world’s smallest violins, because Fortnite
ne’er-do-wells are having a tough time out there. The last couple of
years have seen Epic Games ramp up efforts against players who break
their rules, often in extremely public ways. This time, both a cheater
and a hacker have both issued public statements as a part […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-14, updated: 2025-07-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In terms of power, the Switch 2 is a massive, much-needed upgrade
over Nintendo’s previous console. But technically, the portable hardware
is still less powerful than Xbox Series X or the PS5 — which means that,
despite being a much newer piece of tech, the Switch 2 is lagging behind
the theoretical competition. Most owners […]</p>

<p>Skybound Games revealed Monday that Rex Splode has joined the roster
for the upcoming 2D tag-fighting game Invincible VS. Rex Splode is a
superpowered human with a cybernetic and chemically altered physiology

television series at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden in the U.K., and

<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie from 2023 made over $1 billion at the box
office, with Seth Rogen’s Donkey Kong as the breakout role, so of course
Nintendo is making a spinoff movie — what’s surprising is it’ll be
alongside Universal Pictures. As reported by Video Game Chronicle, a
copyright was filed in May for […]</p>

<p>Superman is off to a great start at the box office. James Gunn kicked
off his reboot of the DC Universe with the second best opening of his
career, and the best ever for a solo Superman movie. According to
Deadline, Superman made $123 million in the U.S. over its opening
weekend, and a further […]</p>

<p>Destiny 2’s newest expansion is on the horizon. Now that the previous
Light and Darkness saga has concluded, this latest expansion marks the
beginning of a new era in Destiny 2’s narrative. The Edge of Fate will

<p>date: 2025-07-13, updated: 2025-07-12, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The New York Times recently published the results of a poll
determining the 100 best movies of the 21st century so far, and the #1
slot went to Bong Joon Ho’s Best Picture winner Parasite. (It topped the
paper’s subsequent readers’ poll, too.) As it happens, Bong Joon Ho also
voted in the poll, and […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-13, updated: 2025-07-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Lois Lane in James Gunn’s Superman cracked me up and annoyed me at
the same time. My initial take on the 2025 version of Lois (played by
Rachel Brosnahan) was that she’s an absolutely terrible journalist. Even
by the standards of a comic book movie featuring a woman who can turn
her hands into buzzsaws […]</p>
