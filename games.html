pivots from elevated horror to elevated cozy kid fantasy with Legend of
Ochi</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>As genre enthusiasts continue to heal from the proliferation of the
label “elevated horror” over the last decade, A24, which defined the
made-up prestige subgenre with films like Hereditary and The Witch, is
not looking back. The studio’s new movie The Legend of Ochi affirms the
strategy — it’s pure fantasy, elevated only by a […]</p>

Study’ Magnemite Timed Research and event guide in Pokémon Go</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>“Magnetic Study” is an electric-type focused event taking place in
the “Max Out” season of Pokémon Go. Running Oct. 15-17, each day of the
event has a unique bonus to take advantage of, as well as Timed Research
focused around one of three Pokémon: Magnemite, Plusle, and Minun. These
Pokémon can also be caught throughout […]</p>

Halloween Countdown: 31 days of horror to watch</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Do you feel that? That chill in the air, that tingling sensation at
the back of your neck? It can only mean one thing. That’s right:
Halloween season is once again upon us! Here at Polygon, we love horror.
We cover it all year round, whether it’s ranking the scariest new

few weeks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>This is, arguably, the moment Microsoft’s $68.7 billion acquisition
of Activision Blizzard finally bears fruit for Game Pass subscribers.
Beyond Diablo 4, few Activision Blizzard titles have made it to the
service yet, but the next few weeks will see the day-one addition of
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, plus a major jewel of […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-15, updated: 2024-10-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>A massive leak of data from Pokémon developer Game Freak, widely
distributed online as the result of a hack of the company, has revealed
new details about the past and future of franchise games, animated
series, and live-action projects. That includes unconfirmed intel about
the next generation of Pokémon — aka Gen 10 — and a new […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-15, updated: 2024-10-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has been continually
tweaking the horde shooter since launch, and some of those changes have
been better received than others. After many nerfs to popular weapons
and stratagems made the community unhappy, Arrowhead reversed course
with a 60-day plan. The first patch released in September to great
acclaim, and […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-15, updated: 2024-10-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Pokémon source code, art, and other documentation
quickly spread across social media and other internet forums. Where did
it come from? Game Freak confirmed last week it had been hacked, with
more than 2,600 pieces of employee data taken. It didn’t confirm the
massive heist of its game data, though, but the […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-15, updated: 2024-10-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the holiday weekend’s box office returns were
dominated by a clown, it’s just probably not the one you expected. After
Joker: Folie à Deux went from a disappointing opening to one of the
steepest box office declines of any superhero movie ever, the void at
the top of the charts was […]</p>

<p>Spiritborn are the agile, monk-like characters in Diablo 4, and are
exclusive to 2024’s Vessel of Hatred DLC. Despite being the “fast melee
class,” the Spiritborn are much more complex than they initially seem,
as they can command four unique beast spirits to imbue their abilities
and create new identities. Thankfully, we’ve spent quite a […]</p>

<p>Prime Video heard you, Invincible fans — the upcoming third season
will not have a mid-season break, unlike last time. The announcement
came in a cheeky teaser released Thursday by Prime Video, where Mark
(Steven Yeun) and Cecil (Walton Goggins) discuss the dramatic events
that closed out season 2 (namely, Mark getting his ass kicked […]</p>

<p>Dimension 20’s Madison Square Garden show in January 2025 is already
sold out, but if you’re on the West Coast, you’re in luck — Dropout
announced that three Dimension 20 shows are coming to West Coast cities
next year.  At the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on June 1, 2025, the
Bad Kids of Dimension […]</p>

<p>Knowing which PS5 Pro games are coming to the console is a decisive
factor in whether the $700 mid-generation refresh is worth buying over a
base PlayStation 5 when it arrives on Nov. 7. First, know the PS5 Pro
will have no exclusive games or accessories, and that everything
released on PS5 will work on […]</p>
