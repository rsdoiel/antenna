to solve the Lighthouse statues puzzle in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, updated: 2024-11-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Lighthouse statues puzzle is available once you finish Dragon
Age: The Veilguard’s prologue and reach the Lighthouse, your base of
operations. You’ll find a door in the library with a mysterious note
that says, “Three meetings, face-to-face, under the sky.” This note
refers to a multi-pronged puzzle that takes place in and around the

<p>Even though they started on the printed page, superheroes have come
to dominate just about every form of media they’ve appeared in. From
movies to video games to more recent installments in the world of
streaming and beyond, superheroes are everywhere. This week, we’re
paying homage to their versatility to cross into different genres and

dream of an Indian MCU barely involves superheroes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, updated: 2024-11-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Hollywood has long shaped mainstream Indian cinema, from numerous
remakes of classic movies (The Godfather, Forrest Gump, and beyond) to a
general aesthetic influence. John Woo’s hyper-stylized Mission:
Impossible 2 practically defined the look and feel of Bollywood action
for an entire generation, via stylistic imitators like the Dhoom series.
However, Tinseltown’s biggest success in […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-04, updated: 2024-11-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There’s no shortage of superhero movies for you to watch in theaters
or at home, between the cultural dominance of the Marvel Cinematic
Universe and DC Comics. But what if someone wanted something, you know,
a little different? We’ve put together this list of 20 great superhero
movies outside of the Marvel and DC universes […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-04, updated: 2024-11-01, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Superhero stories have dominated the pop culture landscape for most
of this millennium, both in visibility and sheer scale. The Marvel
Cinematic Universe is massive: To watch just the core films across the
various phases would take longer than a work week. Yet for fans of
actual play, the MCU’s run time is amateur hour. […]</p>

<p>He may be faster than a speeding bullet and able to leap tall
buildings in a single bound, but the world’s first superhero has yet to
star in a good video game. For a while, this dismal state of affairs
made sense — and once Superman got a reputation for being a part of the

<p>date: 2024-11-04, updated: 2024-11-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Nintendo’s Mario &amp; Luigi series has long been home to clever
innovations, giving players control of the Super Mario
Bros. simultaneously for comical adventures that oftentimes take
advantage of the hardware they were designed for. Past games have
integrated time travel, Luigi’s weird dreams, and exploring the contents
of Bowser’s guts as inspiration. Mario &amp; […]</p>

<p>Keiichirō Toyama is a developer’s developer. He may not be a name you
know off the top of your head, like Shigeru Miyamoto or Hideo Kojima,
but you’re probably familiar with one of the many games he’s directed,
such as Silent Hill, Siren, or Gravity Rush. His latest game,
Slitterhead, feels like a culmination of […]</p>

<p>[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for the end of The Penguin
episode 7.]  While it seems unlikely that the Batman didn’t hear of that
explosion at the end of The Penguin episode 7, the show has made its
case for his absence here: He’s not very high on Oz’s list of problems.
