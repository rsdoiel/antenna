Gunn kicks off his DCU with the biggest solo Superman movie opening
ever</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, updated: 2025-07-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Superman is off to a great start at the box office. James Gunn kicked
off his reboot of the DC Universe with the second best opening of his
career, and the best ever for a solo Superman movie. According to
Deadline, Superman made $123 million in the U.S. over its opening
weekend, and a further […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-13, updated: 2025-07-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Destiny 2’s newest expansion is on the horizon. Now that the previous
Light and Darkness saga has concluded, this latest expansion marks the
beginning of a new era in Destiny 2’s narrative. The Edge of Fate will
include new navigation menus, new Vanguard and Crucible activities, and
an overhaul to the gear system. Below, we […]</p>

the director of Parasite picked this Tom Cruise project as Spielberg’s
best movie of the century</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-13, updated: 2025-07-12, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The New York Times recently published the results of a poll
determining the 100 best movies of the 21st century so far, and the #1
slot went to Bong Joon Ho’s Best Picture winner Parasite. (It topped the
paper’s subsequent readers’ poll, too.) As it happens, Bong Joon Ho also
voted in the poll, and […]</p>

Lane seems terrible at interviewing Superman, but is she playing a
dangerous game?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-13, updated: 2025-07-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Lois Lane in James Gunn’s Superman cracked me up and annoyed me at
the same time. My initial take on the 2025 version of Lois (played by
Rachel Brosnahan) was that she’s an absolutely terrible journalist. Even
by the standards of a comic book movie featuring a woman who can turn
her hands into buzzsaws […]</p>
