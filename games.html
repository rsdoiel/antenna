<p>So you’ve watched all of I Think You Should Leave and you want more
of Tim Robinson yelling? You’re in luck.  Sure, there is, technically,
nothing stopping you from looking up clips of his standup on YouTube,
just as there’s no limit to rewatching I Think You Should Leave. But
maybe you’re thinking to yourself, […]</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of ambient lo-fi music, but sometimes I need something
to wake me up — which is especially true following a three-day weekend,
as many readers are probably feeling right now. And what better way to
get hyped for the day/week/month ahead than with the bombastic and
eclectic grooves of the Street […]</p>

<p>Do you feel that? That chill in the air, that tingling sensation at
the back of your neck? It can only mean one thing. That’s right:
Halloween season is once again upon us! Here at Polygon, we love horror.

<p>The revised Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dungeon Master’s Guide (2024) will
begin trickling out to fans around the world soon thanks to Wizards of
the Coast’s aggressively tiered digital pre-release schedule. However,
the community that enjoys the world’s most popular tabletop role-playing
game is in a very different place than it was just a decade ago, […]</p>

<p>Usually, a sequel to one of the biggest movies of all time would be
carefully concocted in a Hollywood boardroom to maximize four-quadrant
potential. John Jackson Miller wrote his continuation of Tim Burton’s
mega-hit Batman over the last year in his memorabilia-filled office in
central Wisconsin. Miller has been thinking about how to follow up

<p>“Magnetic Study” is an electric-type focused event taking place in
the “Max Out” season of Pokémon Go. Running Oct. 15-17, each day of the

<p>Halloween is nearly upon us; if you are the sort of person who

<p>Bungie’s Destiny franchise is coming to a new platform with Destiny:
Rising, a new entry designed for for mobile platforms. The free-to-play
sci-fi RPG shooter will be a “brand-new adventure set in an alternate
Destiny timeline,” developer and publisher NetEase said in a news

<p>I am not a woman with a sword, and I don’t live in a soft, watercolor

<p>date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Back in April, as part of a promotional video about Metaphor:
ReFantazio, the game’s director Katsura Hashino quietly dropped a fact
(via translator) that has haunted me ever since: “The music you hear in
game is in the protagonist’s head.” On screen while he talks, there’s a
scene depicted of the main character’s tiny fairy […]</p>

<p>Shroomish, the Mushroom Pokémon from Hoenn, can be found in the wild
in Pokémon Go. Yes, Shroomish can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Shroomish and
Breloom both turn a lovely clear orange and yellow when shiny. Breloom
is both usable in some PvP leagues and as a fighting-type attacker in
PvE. Not bad, mushroom with hands. […]</p>

<p>I’ve had a few friends ask me what I think of The Penguin, HBO’s
spinoff miniseries based in the setting of Matt Reeves’ The Batman, and
to all of them I’ve said: “I mean, it’s a good crime show, and there’s
nothing wrong with that, but, like… what am I doing here?”  That is,

<p>A number of Exotics were introduced in Destiny 2, Revenant. As of act
1, there are at least three armor Exotics and two weapons. And while a
surprise Exotic could always pop up, we know for certain that an Exotic
mission will be available sometime during Revenant — likely in act 3,
like in Echoes. […]</p>

<p>Ice Breaker returns in Destiny 2 as part of Oct. 2024’s Revenant Act
I. The exotic sniper rifle from the first Destiny has been one of the
most glaring omissions when it comes to returning weapons, and while it
doesn’t quite offer infinite ammo anymore, it has a new trait and perk
in keeping with […]</p>

<p>Vesper’s Host is a Destiny 2 dungeon arriving alongside Oct. 2024’s
Revenant Act I. Much like the Deep Stone Crypt, it involves exploring a
Braytech facility above Europa, and players familiar with that raid will
feel right at home with that location and its shared mechanics. There
are four encounters to tackle here, with two […]</p>
