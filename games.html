<p>For fans of Tim Burton’s 1998 comedy Beetlejuice, the 2024 sequel
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is a fun exercise in nostalgia, reuniting

<p>Jurassic Park is a horror franchise. Though it’s best remembered for

<p>No one in the year of our lord 2025 is going to argue it’s easy to
make an anime. It’s perhaps a more straightforward process than it’s
ever been in human history, but the artistry and imagination of it still
requires a lot. Dive just a little bit into the background of any of
your […]</p>

<p>Cutiefly, the bee fly Pokémon from Alola, can be found in the wild in
Pokémon Go. Yes, Cutiefly can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Neither Cutiefly

<p>Kuji-kiri are a type of side activity in Assassin’s Creed Shadows
that are, at least in part, essential for completing Naoe’s storyline.
Kuji-kiri are spots places where Naoe meditates, and tend to be tucked
away in remote locations — which means that finding all Kuji-kiri
locations in Assassin’s Creed Shadows mandates navigating some
mountainous, uninhabited […]</p>

<p>Rations are functionally potions in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. You can
use them to heal yourself in combat, but in bigger areas filled with
lots of enemies, the standard allotment of rations might not feel like

<p>Allies, which you might refer to as companions in any other game,
will fight by your side in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, continuing a
tradition you may remember from 15th-century Rome. Receiving the help of
these unique characters is not mandatory to progress in Shadows, what

<p>When the wind hits in Assassin’s Creed Shadows the world feels alive.
Leaves whip up into the air, grass dances back and forth, and Naoe’s
hair sways from side to side. It’s a stunning effect that enriches the

<p>Hunger Games series author Suzanne Collins says she’ll probably never
write a sequel to her bestselling original trilogy, which kickstarted
the YA dystopian trend of the 2010s. But she continues to write prequels
