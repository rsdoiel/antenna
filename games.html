FBC: Firebreak felt like taking on a second job</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, updated: 2025-06-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The first time sticky notes almost killed me in Remedy
Entertainment’s FBC: Firebreak, the new multiplayer spinoff of 2019’s
Control, I laughed out loud. A slow death brought on by the overwhelming
horde of memos you’re tasked with destroying is the most fitting demise
in a game that leans heavily into satirizing corporate life.  The

Pokémon Go?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, updated: 2025-06-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Solosis, the cell Pokémon from Unova, can be found in the wild in
Pokémon Go. Yes, Solosis can be shiny in Pokémon Go! These little gummy
Pokémon don’t have any spots in any of the Pokémon Go metas, but they
are cute. I just want to give them a little squish. What is the shiny

Switch 2 hackers say they’re already getting banned</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, updated: 2025-06-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The original Nintendo Switch had such a massive piracy problem,
hackers were able to play new first-party games weeks before they were
available to the public. Since its release in early June, hackers have
wondered if the Switch 2 might have similar vulnerabilities, but early
reports suggest that Nintendo has anticipated typical methods of
meddling […]</p>

<p>Doing well in Mario Kart World is the same as putting a target on
your back when it comes to blue shells. For some, the combination of a
high skill ceiling, tough NPCs, and prevalence of the spiny item has
proven irksome, but it doesn’t have to be this way. You have more tools

<p>There are only so many ways to capture the majesty of sharks in
reality television programming. In a genre all-but dominated by
Discovery Channel’s Shark Week and National Geographic’s SharkFest, how
can a contender like Netflix make a splash in the shark space? How about

<p>Genshin Impact’s 5.7 patch (aka the Skirk patch) is coming soon, with
some new heavy Danslief story coming with it. If you’re one of the

<p>Everyone’s on edge the moment that long HP bar appears and Elden Ring
Nightreign’s choir rises into a crescendo. Even with a group of three
people, boss fights are meant to be challenging in a Souls game. Yet few
enemy encounters fill the community with as much dread as the Bell

<p>From the beginning of its 2022 launch, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds
offered a different approach compared to previous entries in the
franchise. Tapping into nostalgia with a prequel to the original ’60s
Star Trek, Goldsman and his co-showrunner, Henry Alonso Myers, provided
fresh spins on the original show’s most famous characters and minor

<p>Borderlands 4 is now up for pre-order, and the price is $69.99, not
the once-declared $79.99. Publisher 2K Games revealed the news on
Monday, finally putting to rest the tired conversation surrounding

<p>CD Projekt RED is taking a “console-first” approach to The Witcher

launch disaster, according to a recent interview with Digital Foundry.

you’ve probably ventured into Nexus Mods, the largest repository of

<p>While we’ve had plenty of superhero games come out over the past
decade and a half (and I’m always down for more), most have either been
open-world adventures or fighting games. I’m as excited as anyone for
the upcoming Marvel Tōkon and Invincible VS, but I’m also ready for a

<p>Following Grand Theft Auto 6’s retreat into 2026, last week’s launch
of Nintendo Switch 2 will likely stand as the gaming event of 2025. And
at the center of that launch is Mario Kart World, an ambitious sequel to
one of the best-selling games of all time from perhaps the single most
