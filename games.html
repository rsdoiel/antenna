teaser video. On Wednesday, April 2, Nintendo will provide more details

<p>Romance isn’t a huge component of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but it

<p>Every once in a while Games Workshop, the multi-billion-dollar
monolith dubbed by at least one competitor as “the most disruptive of
all tabletop companies,” does something surprisingly introspective.
Sometimes it’s a comic book partnership that exposes the intrinsic
frailty of its main characters. Other times it’s a surprisingly clear

<p>Not many people make the jump from YouTube video game parodist to

John Hsu, all the more fascinating. Hsu spent 10 years making World of
