<p>For those of us who grew up in the 1990s or early 2000s, A Goofy
Movie was everywhere. Substitute teachers showed it during the last lazy

cartoon-watching hours. And friends loaded up the VHS tape during
sleepovers. The 1995 blockbuster disappointment deserves the cult

<p>PlayerAuctions has responded to Roblox’s February lawsuit, in which
the gaming company is looking to shut down the third-party buying and

<p>Last week, Nintendo revealed a ton of information about the Switch 2.
And while there were some surprises — like a bizarrely destructive
Donkey Kong game — the real shock was that of the sticker variety. The

$79.99 for Mario Kart […]</p>

<p>Nintendo has made its own Discord-like chat app for the Switch 2, and
it’s going to charge you for it. Once the free period is over on March

<p>There is something perfectly simple and catchy about the Wii eShop’s
theme song. It’s been remixed and parodied, even becoming the perfect
