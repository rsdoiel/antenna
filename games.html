<p>The rate of leaks about Nintendo’s next console is intensifying —
although the same can’t necessarily be said of genuinely new information

<p>Earlier this year, Helldiver 2’s grip on gaming culture was
unmatched. For at least a month, every corner of social media was
brimming with memes created from or inspired by absurd gameplay from the
smash-hit by Arrowhead Games. And that’s not a fluke, comedic play was
built into the bones of the game, all the […]</p>

<p>Viper Napuatzi is a boss in Path of Exile 2’s third act. Located in
Utzaal, Napuatzi deploys a variety of poison attacks in an extremely
small arena, forcing you into a claustrophobic fight. Viper Napuatzi may
not be as complex or overwhelming as some of the other fights in Act 2
or Act 3, but […]</p>

<p>Back in May of 2023, I wrote this editorial sharing a frustration
with the board gaming trend of adopting extremely lengthy multi-session
campaigns. With the advent of crowdfunding and the explosion of big-box
narrative-driven games, as well as the success of the legacy format, the
exhausting 20-plus-hour campaign structure really took off. There are

<p>I have a confession: I’m a rampant roguelike uninstaller. Almost
invariably, I reach a point with games like Balatro, Dead Cells, or
Hades when, watching my playtime balloon, I feel the need to remove the
temptation to play the game. Roguelikes, almost by definition, pursue an
addictive structure that reviewers often describe as the “one […]</p>

<p>Mythical Island is the first expansion for Pokémon TCG Pocket, adding
dozens of new cards that are sure to shake up the meta (and demolish
even more friendships). The expansion pack is tropical island-themed,
features twists on cards like Magmar, Exeggcute, and Aerodactyl
