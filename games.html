<p>This report comes from Fantastic Fest 2024, the annual genre film
festival in Austin, Texas. We’ll have more reports from the ground
throughout the fest. Immediately before Fantastic Fest’s late-night
screening of Norway’s animated musical Spermageddon, the fest employee
introducing it described it as “the most midnight movie that ever

<p>A new trailer for Marvel Studios’ Thunderbolts* may not have revealed

neon blue/red Joy-Con for $299.99 ($50 off). It’s not typical for this

miniatures skirmish game has grown to become one of the pillars of the
entire 40K franchise. With the new Warhammer 40,000 […]</p>
