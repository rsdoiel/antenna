Lorcana release dates set for Archazia’s Island, Reign of Jafar
sets</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, updated: 2025-01-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Disney Lorcana’s next set, Archazia’s Island, will launch March 21,
Ravensburger announced at the London Toy Fair Tuesday. It also announced
Reign of Jafar will launch on June 6, featuring a menacing Jafar who
will occupy Archazia’s Island in what the press materials call “the
greatest threat that Lorcana has faced.” Ravensburger teased visuals,
too, […]</p>

Marvel Rivals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, updated: 2025-01-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Assists in Marvel Rivals are when you help an ally get an elimination
during the game. Duelist and Vanguard players might not be getting as
many assists as their Strategist counterparts, but that’s due to how
they help allies get eliminations — so rather than not getting the final
hit on an enemy, you need […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-21, updated: 2025-01-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Galar region is in Pokémon Go, meaning Pokémon from the Sword and
Shield games (Gen 8) will start appearing over time. Most Pokémon will
get added through events, with various Pokémon making their debuts
around whatever theme each event has. While we did already have some
Pokémon like Falinks and regional variations like Galarian […]</p>

<p>Rookidee makes its debut in Pokémon Go as part of Jan. 2025’s
“Steeled Resolve” event. The Galar flying-type can evolve into
Corvisquire and then Corviknight as part of its evolution line, provided
you have enough candy. Similar to many recent new Pokémon in Pokémon Go,
Rookidee cannot be found in the wild — but the […]</p>

<p>Today, tabletop game publisher Ravensburger announced a Dungeons
&amp; Dragons-based expansion to its acclaimed Horrified tabletop game
series at the London Toy Fair. Slated for release this summer, the game
will set players against four iconic enemies from the world’s most
popular tabletop role-playing game — with some additional mechanics
inspired by D&amp;D.  The fifth […]</p>

<p>Wooper and Paldean Wooper, the water fish and poison fish Pokémon
from Johto and Paldea, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes,
Wooper and Paldean Wooper can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Both the Johto
version of Wooper and Paldean Wooper have great shinies. The former was

<p>Infinity Nikki has codes to redeem that give you goodies, just like
many other modern mobile games on the market. You won’t want to miss out
on using these codes, since they expire and they actually give some
pretty good loot, like premium currency. Below we list all the active

<p>At the London Toy Fair, award-winning publisher Ravensburger
announced three major updates to its Villainous franchise in 2025, a
series of board games based on iconic Disney properties. The
announcement includes a new all-ages board game, Disney Villainous
Unstoppable!, an expanded international tournament circuit, and new

<p>date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s all thriller, no filler this week in television — well, that
plus a comedy-drama about girls trying to find fulfilling love and sex
during their sophomore year of college. But the main events this week
are pretty much all some type of espionage thriller. Pretty much all of
these spies are stressed (predictable) and […]</p>

<p>It’s 2025, and no, we still haven’t heard word about a Red God
release date. In the meantime, though, I’ve been holding myself over
lately with the Red Rising board game. Turns out, a conveniently
color-coded social hierarchy lends itself not just to timely social
commentary, but also to the bones of a terrific board […]</p>

<p>All focus was on TikTok in the last week, as the company prepared to
— and eventually did — shut down its video-sharing app to adhere to a
national security law explicitly aimed at the ByteDance-owned company.
But the the U.S. action has resulted in a broader ripple effect. Marvel

<p>There’s life in the old dog yet. Despite The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
having presumably been played by every living human at this point, a 90%
off deal has made the 13-year-old role-playing game one of the
most-played games on Steam once more. The deal reduced the price of
Skyrim’s updated Special Edition to just […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Most Marvel Rivals tier lists agree: Scarlet Witch is one of the
worst heroes to play if you plan on climbing the game’s competitive
ranks. Like Moira in Overwatch, she’s devastating if left unchecked, but
crumbles as soon as people know how to deal with her. In the highest
ranks where the meta revolves around […]</p>

<p>Dynamax Articuno is the first Legendary we’re seeing in Max
Battles for Pokémon Go. It’s making its debut during Max Monday on
Jan. 20 from 6-7 p.m. and will be available afterwards until Jan. 27

<p>TikTok is “in the process of restoring service” in the United States

<p>Game designer Sam Barlow deserves a lot of credit for driving the
“redemption” of FMVs. The full-motion video game format was pioneered in
the early ’90s as a cutting-edge visual technique in an age when
computer graphics were more simplistic. But long before that, filmmakers
were experimenting with ways to make films more interactive, in […]</p>

<p>Netflix’s continued investment in anime has yielded fruit over the

some of not only the most popular and iconic anime series in recent
memory, but also a host of impressive original anime titles. It has

<p>Grand Theft Hamlet is a documentary film, kind of. It’s also an
experimental theater project. It’s also a rough-and-ready feature-length
