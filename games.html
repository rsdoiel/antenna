<p>date: 2024-12-22, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>For decades, the Star Wars Holiday Special was a misbegotten artifact
of a specific era of network TV variety-show thinking, and Lucasfilm
seemed content to pretend it never happened. Fans considered it a black
mark on George Lucas’ franchise, and made it the butt of endless fandom
jokes. But that’s changed over the past decade […]</p>
