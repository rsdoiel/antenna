<p>Angry Kirby was once an unlikely poster child for the difference
between Japanese and American sensibilities. When home in Japan, Kirby’s
joyful, round face was rarely seen without a welcoming smile. In the
U.S., something was different: Kirby, the epitome of kawaii with a puffy
pink marshmallow face, had a dangerous mean streak.  It began […]</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, the successor to the Nintendo Switch, is
Nintendo’s upcoming console. Announced on Jan. 16, the upgraded console

<p>The Ayaneo Pocket Micro is the modern Sony Walkman of gaming
handhelds — that is to say, its boxy, high-end design is strangely
appealing, and because of its high price and narrow focus, it’s only
going to please a certain type of person. To stand out from the crowd of
Android gaming handhelds, of which […]</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns just won’t stop returning. Players may

the updated Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the 3DS from 2013, but
that’s just the tip of the banana hoard. Returns was also reissued for

<p>Godzilla is coming to Fortnite in Chapter 6 Season 1, ready to stomp
on everything (and look extremely weird wearing Kicks while doing so).
Compared to previous seasonal skins, like Solid Snake, Geralt of Rivia,
and Wolverine, Godzilla’s intimidating bulk doesn’t quite transpose to a
vaguely humanoid frame. But the character’s signature chonkiness

<p>Creating a brand-new franchise in a world of IP adaptations is hard
