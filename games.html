rules put the blade back in Hexblade</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Wizards of the Coast uses the Unearthed Arcana playtest series to
test reactions to proposed new content for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Some
of these ideas never make it into a book, and some are published with
only slight tweaks. But the backlash to the proposed new version of the
Warlock subclass Hexblade released in May […]</p>

Steam Summer Sale discount is the safest bet you can make</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, updated: 2025-06-27, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Balatro is one of the (many, many) games marked down for Steam’s
annual summer sale. Take it from me: Picking up Balatro on sale — no
matter how big or small the discount — is one of the safest bets you can
make. As someone who couldn’t tell a flush from a full house but could

to get free Crowned Sword Energy and Crowned Shield Energy with codes in
Pokémon Go</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, updated: 2025-06-29, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Pokémon Go is giving away handfuls of free Crowned Sword Energy and
Crowned Shield Energy via codes ahead of Pokémon Go Fest Global 2025.
Similarly to how previous energy-based events have functioned, codes
will be revealed every day from June 25-28, so long as the Pokémon Go
YouTube channel gains at least 2,000 subscribers per […]</p>

<p>Pokémon Go‘s big yearly event is upon us. Pokémon Go Fest 2025 comes
with its usual perks, including rotating spawns and the global debut of
the Crowned forms of Zacian and Zamazenta. The Crowned forms are the
main feature here, encouraging all players to hop into raids to score

<p>date: 2025-06-29, updated: 2025-06-29, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In the new horror sequel M3GAN 2.0, the killer robot doll from the
first movie meets the memes where they live. She gets taller and faster
and more fashion-forward; she flies through the air in a high-tech
wingsuit; she sings Kate Bush; and, with a self-consciousness that
threatens to ruin the bit, she goes on […]</p>
