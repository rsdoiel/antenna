Hunter Wilds and save 18%</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, updated: 2024-09-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds, the next flagship game in Capcom’s seminal and
self-descriptive series, isn’t due out for another five months —
Feb. 28, 2025, to be exact. That said, you might already know that
you’ll be picking up the game agnostic of the reviews — that the calling
to hunt monsters and hang out with […]</p>

orc on The Rings of Power has a personality — just ask the folks who
made them</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, updated: 2024-09-27, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Being an orc in The Rings of Power is tough. Like everyone else,
you’ve got Sauron, a pillar of evil in the realm, returning to
Middle-earth. And on top of all of that, there are a lot of elves who
want you dead just for existing. Meanwhile, the entire orc race is just
trying to […]</p>

<p>In 1987, Sega released After Burner and After Burner 2, a pair of
“rail shooters” designed to capitalize on the global fascination with
fighter jets. Top Gun had been released the year prior. Both After
Burner entries flew to international success. However, years later,
after cultural lust for military planes had cooled, creator and video

<p>Princess Zelda wields an enormous toolkit in The Legend of Zelda:
Echoes of Wisdom. With the flick of a wand, she can summon perfect
copies of anything from a household pot to a a living, moving monster
that fights for her. These objects, called Echoes, help her navigate the
terrain and fight baddies. And while […]</p>

<p>Adult ADHD! I have it. If you feel me, and I know many of you do, you
might already know about productivity games. These games incentivize you
to complete tasks, make progress on projects, and keep good habits with
a lot of tried and true coping mechanisms — all masked in a cloak of
cute […]</p>

movies that inspired My Old Ass, according to director Megan Park</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, updated: 2024-09-27, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In My Old Ass, a teenage girl named Elliott (Maisy Stella) takes a
ton of shrooms and encounters her older self (Aubrey Plaza), who then
proceeds to give advice via long phone calls during a critical summer.
Throughout the movie it’s ambiguous whether the time travel is actually
happening — and director Megan Park says […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-29, updated: 2024-09-27, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The love life of Daryl Dixon is a maddening series of
might-have-beens, whether you’re watching from the sidelines or
championing your OTP of choice. His journey is still unfolding on The
Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon – The Book of Carol, but it’s difficult to
imagine him getting attached to anyone after so many dead ends.  […]</p>

<p>It’s 1971. Your top aide approaches you in the Oval Office. “As
president,” he says, “you have authorized numerous dirty tricks straight
