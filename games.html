2 price won’t increase in response to tariffs, analyst says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-08, updated: 2025-04-08, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>One research firms expects the price of Nintendo Switch 2 to hold
steady in response to President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, arguing
that Nintendo had already baked potential tariffs into the system’s
cost. That’s despite Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser
downplaying the impact of tariffs on Nintendo’s price decision-making
process. Research firm DFC Intelligence […]</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows players will spend dozens of hours

Switch 2 is so expensive, according to Nintendo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo revealed a ton of information about the Switch 2.
And while there were some surprises — like a bizarrely destructive
Donkey Kong game — the real shock was that of the sticker variety. The
prices of both the Switch 2 console ($449.99) and its games (as much as
$79.99 for Mario Kart […]</p>

music will likely never return to Nintendo’s eShops</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, updated: 2025-04-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There is something perfectly simple and catchy about the Wii eShop’s
theme song. It’s been remixed and parodied, even becoming the perfect
sketch fodder for Nirvana the Band the Show. You’re probably already
humming it right now. While that music was so iconic, there is a
surprisingly practical reason that later system shops, like the […]</p>

<p>Good news! If you’ve been fretting about abandoning your Animal
Crossing: New Horizons island save on a console that will rot away in
storage, then worry not. You’ll be able to seamlessly transfer your
island save data to the Nintendo Switch 2, without needing to download
an extra app or use a cloud save. The […]</p>

<p>The house at Mt. Holly has 45 rooms. But the placement of each of

house and its estate as an inheritance, but only if you can find the
mysterious 46th room.  In this way, Blue Prince blends its puzzles

<p>While Nintendo shared a lot about the hardware for Switch 2 during
its April 2 Direct and subsequent Treehouse streams, the company still
won’t share the exact workings of the second iteration of Joy-Con or Pro
Controller directional inputs. Specifically, it won’t confirm if the new
sticks will use Hall effect technology, which has been […]</p>

<p>The Switch 2 won’t be joining the Xbox and PlayStation consoles with
its own system-wide achievements, Nintendo confirmed to Polygon in a
recent interview. When we asked vice president of player and product
experience Bill Trinen if we can expect achievements, he gave a pretty
clear answer: “Nope.” Just like on Switch 1, it’ll be […]</p>

<p>Friend codes continue to exist on Nintendo Switch 2, but adding
people will be slightly easier than it was on Switch 1, Nintendo
confirmed to Polygon in a recent interview. The heart of the friends
list system on Switch 2 remains the same as it was on Switch 1. That’s
why you can transfer it […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-06, updated: 2025-04-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>When Nintendo launched the Switch in 2017, it had no competition in
dedicated handheld gaming, a sector it had established with the Game Boy
in 1989 and ruled ever since. Sega had come and gone; Sony, after two
determined attempts with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita,
had just about given up. As Switch 2 […]</p>

<p>As it barrels through its characteristically outlandish fourth and
final season, Danny McBride’s HBO comedy The Righteous Gemstones has
cemented a reputation for itself. Yes, it’s side-splittingly funny. Yes,
its “failchildren of a crumbling empire” narrative is surprisingly
relevant. Yes, there is a core of sincerity at the center of the
madness. But Gemstones’ legacy […]</p>

<p>I did something horrible. I told Jafar, the scheming vizier villain
in Disney’s Aladdin, about cryptocurrency, and now he’s determined to

<p>Tuesday morning, Lionsgate announced that among a trio of new
projects in the John Wick universe, there will be an animated prequel
movie about the night the master assassin initially broke free from his
obligation to the High Table. Intended for “more mature audiences,” the
movie will be directed by Shannon Tindle (Ultraman: Rising) and […]</p>
