<p>Ahead of Black Myth: Wukong’s Aug. 20 release date, publisher Hero
Games (acting on behalf of developer Game Science) reportedly sent a
strange directive to several video game streamers who received early
codes for the game: Don’t talk about anything that “instigates negative

actual real-life prestigious chefs (the titular gastronauts, exploring

— there’s nothing there to […]</p>

<p>The impulse to iterate on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen is,

Watchmen deconstructed the traditions of cape comics, captivating the
