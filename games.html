holiday-special style makes 1977’s The Hobbit a great Christmas
watch</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-24, updated: 2024-12-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years, Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy has
been enshrined as a wintertime favorite by those craving spectacle and a
cozy time on the couch. We can (and have!) debated if the films are best
served by one holiday or another, but every fantasy nut seems to agree:
The mix […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-24, updated: 2024-12-23, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In Brandon Sanderson’s Mistborn series, some people have the power to
metabolize metal to work magic, burning pewter to enhance themselves
physically or brass to soothe someone else’s emotions. But the most
powerful characters in the world are the Mistborn, who can use many
types of metals and combine their powers to effectively fly and […]</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about YouTube is discovering a channel that
has this one stellar video unlike anything else they’ve done. Bill
Wurtz’s “history of japan” is a classic example, the 80 million-view
juggernaut from a channel that typically posts bite-sized neon
surrealist animations. But I’d like to turn your attention to another

<p>Delibird, the delivery Pokémon from Johto, can be found in the wild
in Pokémon Go. Yes, Delibird with its holiday ribbon accessory can be
shiny in Pokémon Go! Delibird doesn’t see any use in PvP or PvE content,
but who can say no to a cute little delivery penguin, especially when it

<p>Christopher Nolan has decided to get a bit more literal with his next
epic, by taking to the past and adapting Homer’s The Odyssey, according
to a new post on X by Universal Pictures. The reveal came after months
of fans speculating about the filmmaker’s follow-up to Oppenheimer,

<p>Before Overwatch and Marvel Rivals, there was another zany,
character-based hero shooter that gamers adored: Valve’s Team Fortress
2. Team Fortress 2 is still a relevant game, and has retained a fanbase

<p>In the days since Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was released, I’ve been doing
a diligent search for the best Sonic-inspired tabletop games out there.
And folks, I’ve found them. Surprisingly, there is no official Sonic the

<p>Predator cores are a new crafting material added in Palworld
Feybreak. Predator cores are used to create items like pouches and the
Meowmere, a sword from Terraria that meows and fires bullets. However,

<p>Life is stressful. Sometimes it’s difficult to unwind. For me, a
surefire method to improve my mood when I’m feeling down has been
watching Australian radio station Triple J’s Like A Version series,
which includes a regular segment where established and up-and-coming

<p>Movies and video games have always had a somewhat tumultuous

it’s rare that the two mediums see eye to eye. Which is why it’s so

<p>For decades, the Star Wars Holiday Special was a misbegotten artifact
of a specific era of network TV variety-show thinking, and Lucasfilm

jokes. But that’s changed over the past decade […]</p>
