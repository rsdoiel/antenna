‘Pilgrimage’ wayshrine locations in Oblivion Remastered</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>“Pilgrimage” is a side quest in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
Remastered that requires you to look for nine shrines across the map to
pray at. Praying at these shrines will help determine if you’re worthy
of becoming a knight. While this quest doesn’t have any rewards, it
opens up several other future ones, including […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>With all the hubbub about Donkey Kong’s new look in Donkey Kong
Bananza, one artist took it upon themselves to reimagine what the King
of Swing might have looked like in the upcoming Switch 2 game if
Nintendo had stuck with previous design. “I don’t like how they portray
DK in Bananza, so I edited […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There’s a lot of injustice in The Last of Us. The Cordyceps outbreak
doesn’t play favorites (outside of Ellie’s immunity, of course), so
people are constantly ripped away from their loved ones; the fight
between human factions for the few remaining supplies tears families
apart right and left, and the survivors are always left to […]</p>

<p>This week we’re talking emotions. I know what you’re thinking: Isn’t
that the lifeblood of so much of TV and movies? Sure! But the
throughline between the new premieres and finales is Big Stakes and Big
Feelings. Whether it’s the end of the world (The Eternaut, The Walking
Dead: Dead City) or it just feels […]</p>
