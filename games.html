is going after the leaker behind major Pokémon ‘Teraleak’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Nintendo is asking a California court to force Discord to give up the
identity of the person behind last year’s massive Pokémon data breach,
known among the Pokémon community as the “Teraleak.” It’s called the
Teraleak because of just how much information was released online; the
leaker claimed to have source code for the upcoming […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There’s a lot to love about the Nintendo Switch, not least of which
the abundance of titles with local multiplayer features, making it a
great console for game night with friends or a casual play session with
a roommate. We’ve collected some of our favorite titles that allow for
some good old-fashioned local play. It’s […]</p>

one big disappointment in Ryan Coogler’s fabulous horror movie
Sinners</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Hands down, Ryan Coogler’s 1930s-set crime film/historical
thriller/vampire horror-show Sinners is one of the best movies of 2025
so far. The Black Panther and Fruitvale Station director has made a
project that’s simultaneously audacious and personal, the kind of
big-swing original story that cinephiles are always clamoring for around
the edges of the endless franchise […]</p>

compassion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Look Outside is a horror game with teeth — quite literally: They’re
bursting through my neighbors’ skin and gnashing on anything that gets
too close. Look Outside was originally released on March 21, and the
game has since consistently floated to the top of my social media feeds
as people marvel about the scares this […]</p>

<p>The “Festival of Accord: Blossomdance” is a seasonal event in Monster
Hunter Wilds that will transform the Grand Hub into a pink cherry
blossom-filled wonderland. First announced during the Monster Hunter
Wilds showcase in March, this event will be one of the first big changes
coming to the game since “Title Update 1.” The time-limited […]</p>

<p>Here at Polygon, we aren’t strangers to the video game notebook.
Handwritten notes can create a physical place that can serve as a guide
and aid in our own game experiences. They can also enhance enjoyment of
a game. Our staff has created assassination bullet journals and argued
that taking notes can make games more […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-20, updated: 2025-04-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals is doomed to forever be compared to Overwatch. It’s a
team-based shooter with heroes, and some of those heroes happen to have
a lot in common with the ones in Overwatch. NetEase has never directly
said Blizzard’s game was an inspiration, but a now-removed line in
Marvel Rivals’ code confirms that someone on […]</p>
