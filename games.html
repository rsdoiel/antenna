<p>Each week on Polygon, we round up the most notable new releases to

<p>date: 2025-02-21, updated: 2025-02-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Ne Zha 2 features a combat sequence that has to be seen to be
believed. The Chinese movie, which recently passed the $1.5 billion mark
at the box office to become the biggest international animated hit of
all time, is built around shows of immense power, leading up to a

<p>When NetEase slashed jobs at its Marvel Rivals development studio in
Seattle earlier this week, it was unclear why the Chinese game publisher
would make cuts around such a successful project. Marvel Rivals has

<p>Tarkir: Dragonstorm, perhaps the most metal name for a Magic: The

<p>Wizards of the Coast debuted multiple new Magic: The Gathering sets

<p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 battle pass skins are many and varied for
