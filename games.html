Theft Hamlet, which mixes Shakespeare with GTA Online, is coming to
streaming</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, updated: 2024-10-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>While many gamers are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Grand Theft
Auto 6, there’s still a ton of activity around the current iteration of
the mega-blockbuster franchise. Fans are still role-playing on private
servers, goofing around in the game’s online mode, or — in the case of
two filmmakers — staging a film adaptation of […]</p>

our documentary, The Great Game: The Making of Spycraft</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, updated: 2024-10-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In 1995, former KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin and ex-CIA Director
William Colby collaborated in an unexpected way: they made a video game.
Nearly 30 years later, The Great Game: The Making of Spycraft uncovers
the story behind the multi-million dollar espionage game that brought
together Cold War power players, the up-and-coming video game publisher

The Rise of the Golden Idol is coming out ridiculously soon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, updated: 2024-10-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Watch out, other video games, because there’s a new GOTY contender in
town. At least for my personal taste, that is. The Case of the Golden
Idol was my favorite game of 2022 — it’s a short, haunting, supernatural
mystery game made up of individual chapters that each felt super
satisfying to solve. Its sequel, […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-10, updated: 2024-10-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Nintendo’s next move has never been more difficult to predict. Just
when you think all it has up its sleeve is the impending Switch 2
reveal, it faked out fans this week with new hardware… in the form of a
surprisingly innovative alarm clock called Alarmo. The same day,
Nintendo followed up with a vague […]</p>

<p>The second season of Hellbound, the Korean fantasy thriller created
by Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho, is a little more than two weeks
away. And from the looks of the latest trailer, fans of the series are
in for an experience just as nightmarish and intense as last season.
Released on Wednesday, the trailer […]</p>

<p>What’s a witch without her dark magical secrets? Marvel’s Agatha All
Along miniseries has one front and center. The starring turn for Kathryn
Hahn’s diabolical Agatha Harkness, last seen in 2021’s WandaVision,
features a plucky young witchy wannabe initially only as “Teen,” and
played by Heartstopper’s Joe Locke. The character’s real name has not

builds in Diablo 4 season 6</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, updated: 2024-10-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Barbarians are a relatively simple class in Diablo 4: They smash
stuff. However, Diablo 4 is underscored by math that’s so complex that
even the simple act of smashing stuff becomes a dizzying equation.
That’s where we come in, with our suggestions of the best Barbarian
builds for Diablo 4 season 6. Barbarians are big, […]</p>

Diablo 4 season 6</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, updated: 2024-10-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Druids are one of the most interesting classes in Diablo 4. They’re
not only able to control animals — they can turn into animals (and also
cast powerful spells). The result is a class that’s packed with complex
ability combinations that can deal massive damage. As such, designing an
ideal Druid build is a puzzle […]</p>

<p>Sorcerers are the magic-slinging wizards of Sanctuary in Diablo 4.
But with each element they can harness bringing its own unique effect,
it can be easy to get overwhelmed when trying to design a Sorcerer
build. That’s where we come in, with our suggestions of the best
Sorcerer builds for Diablo 4 season 6. Sorcerers […]</p>
