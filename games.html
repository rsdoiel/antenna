first Thunderbolts* trailer teases the next big deal in the MCU:
Bob</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-23, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>If you’re not the type of sicko who hunts down the leaked, illicility
recorded trailers that premiere at San Diego Comic-Con or Disney’s D23,
good news: Your first look at Marvel Studios’ Thunderbolts* is here. And
if you have no idea what a Thunderbolt is — or why there’s an asterisk
there — I can answer […]</p>

year so far</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s been a busy year for thrillers so far, with all manner of
small-town crime going down, serial killers on the prowl, and more. But
no matter the subgenre or setting, there have been plenty of excellent
thrillers to keep us entertained. Here’s a list of all the best
thrillers in 2024 so far. They’re […]</p>

<p>Stardew Valley’s major 1.6 update will be released on Android, iOS,

<p>date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-23, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>One of the best unofficial October Prime Day deals has come early at
Woot, where you can get a new Nintendo Switch OLED with either white or
neon blue/red Joy-Con for $299.99 ($50 off). It’s not typical for this
console to receive any kind of discount, so we’re usually skeptical that
there’s something amiss when […]</p>

40K Kill Team: Hivestorm is way more than a starter set</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>I once joked that Games Workshop’s Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team was the
sick man of the British company’s otherwise thriving family of science
fiction wargames. After a high-profile relaunch in 2018, the small unit
miniatures skirmish game has grown to become one of the pillars of the
entire 40K franchise. With the new Warhammer 40,000 […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-23, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>NetherRealm Studios rebooted its 32-year-old Mortal Kombat universe
with last year’s Mortal Kombat 1, resetting the balance of power and
giving classic characters new origin stories. This week, NetherRealm
will continue the story of MK1 with the Khaos Reigns expansion, which
introduces new (reimagined) characters and new conflicts. Mortal Kombat
1’s story ended in total […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-22, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>We’re living in the middle of a bounty of Middle-earth media. Last
year’s wretched Gollum game, 2026’s apparent Gollum duology, The Rings
of Power’s elven kings, War of the Rohirrim’s horse maidens, and more
video games of various scope and subject reportedly still on the way. 
And yet none of the above is giving the […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-22, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In Groundhog Day, some unexplained force — maybe celestial, certainly
moral — traps misanthropic weatherman Bill Murray in a single, repeated
day until he sheds his attitude and becomes a better person. In Palm
Springs, shiftless wedding guests Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti fall
into a time-loop vortex, a freak of astrophysics, in a cave. […]</p>
