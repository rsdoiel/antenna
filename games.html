<p>The Fast and Furious crew are rolling into Netflix with their first

<p>Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West aren’t exactly
kid-friendly. Both games were rated T for Teen, and I tend to think of
them as these high-minded stories about found family, billionaire greed,
and environmental collapse. So, reinterpreting those stories through
plasticky slapstick feels somehow disingenuous. When Lego Horizon

<p>date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Aaron Schimberg’s fantastical dark comedy A Different Man is one of
2024’s richest, strangest movies — a film about a man who radically

was always going to have a banger season 2 soundtrack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Arcane’s secret sauce has always been its soundtrack. There’s no
better example of this than one of the early scenes of season 2’s first
episode, as Caitlyn mourns the death of her mother. Rather than forcing
grief-stricken dialogue to communicate how she’s feeling, the show cuts
to a completely unique animation style, with stylized black […]</p>

<p>At the risk of being entirely unrelatable: You know that music they
play at the spa? That synthy, spaced-out soundscape type of stuff that
isn’t exactly music, but isn’t exactly not music? The sort of playlist
you can find if you take a wrong turn from your favorite lo-fi playlist?
