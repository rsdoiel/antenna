Reignited Trilogy blazes onto Xbox Game Pass Tuesday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, updated: 2024-11-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Spyro Reignited Trilogy is coming to Xbox Game Pass on November 12
or, for those of you as calendar-blind as me, Tuesday. The bundle,
originally released in 2018, includes remakes of Spyro the Dragon, Spyro
2: Ripto’s Rage!, and Spyro: Year of the Dragon from the original
PlayStation. Sypro Reignited Trilogy may scrap the classic […]</p>

host of Dropout’s Smartypants tells you how to throw a banger PowerPoint
party</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Of Dropout’s many fun new shows in 2024, the most exciting premise
was Smartypants. It takes the concept of the “PowerPoint party,” where
groups of friends get together to give individual presentations on
topics they are obsessed with, and places it within the framing device
of the “Smartypants society.” That means a who’s who of […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-11, updated: 2024-11-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Five years after announcing a reboot of Blade set within the
continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel… still hasn’t made a
reboot of Blade set within the continuity of the Marvel Cinematic
Universe. Fans got a tease — remember that post-credits scene in
Eternals? — but theoretical star Mahershala Ali has yet to appear

<p>date: 2024-11-11, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Judero, released for PC on Sept. 16, swings for the fences with a
do-it-yourself spirit that sets the game apart from both its AAA and
indie contemporaries. As the first game developed by Talha and Jack Co —
Talha Kaya (Soul Searching, Pill Baby) and Jack King-Spooner (Beeswing,
Dujanah) — it’s the perfect example of […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Life is a funny thing. You know what else is funny? Video games.
Crafting an enjoyable or edifying gaming experience is challenging
enough. But creating a game that manages to be hilarious? That’s a feat
of design and writing worthy of admiration. If you find yourself in need
of a good hearty chuckle, we’ve got […]</p>

Stan is so glad he doesn’t have to explain the ending of A Different
Man</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Aaron Schimberg’s fantastical dark comedy A Different Man is one of
2024’s richest, strangest movies — a film about a man who radically
changes his appearance and his life, but is haunted by the success of
someone who looks just like he used to. It’s a perfect viewing companion
for The Substance, another woozy, disturbing 2024 […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Arcane’s secret sauce has always been its soundtrack. There’s no
better example of this than one of the early scenes of season 2’s first
episode, as Caitlyn mourns the death of her mother. Rather than forcing
grief-stricken dialogue to communicate how she’s feeling, the show cuts
to a completely unique animation style, with stylized black […]</p>

<p>Walmart has several waves of Black Friday deals coming up, the first
of which begins on Nov. 11, followed by two others happening Nov. 25 and

<p>At the risk of being entirely unrelatable: You know that music they
play at the spa? That synthy, spaced-out soundscape type of stuff that
isn’t exactly music, but isn’t exactly not music? The sort of playlist
you can find if you take a wrong turn from your favorite lo-fi playlist?

<p>Final Fantasy 14’s first post-Dawntrail patch is on the horizon, with
maintenance going down for the game for about seven hours before patch
7.1 properly launches. Below, we explain when FFXIV Dawntrail
maintenance ends and some of the things you can look forward to when the

<p>Pokémon Go is having a Mankey Community Day event on Sunday, Nov. 10,
from 2-5 p.m. in your local time. As expected with a Community Day
event, Mankey will spawn in huge numbers with a high chance for it to
