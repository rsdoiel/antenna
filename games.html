stellar XM4 noise-canceling headphones are 63% off for Prime Day</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, updated: 2024-10-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s typical for Sony to knock an extra $50 or so off its headphones
once they become outdated. What’s atypical is the kind of deal that’s
happening now on its WH1000XM4 over-ear headphones. Ahead of Amazon’s
October Prime Day, the last-gen (but still great) noise-canceling
headphones are $129.99 at Target — a whopping 63% discount […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-07, updated: 2024-10-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>We’ve already seeing a lot of great deals before Amazon’s October
Prime Day formally kicks off. One that I suspect sports fans may
appreciate seeing is the 30% off sale happening on EA Sports College
Football 25, Electronic Art’s much-anticipated return to NCAA football —
the first in a decade. This big price cut is […]</p>

<p>There’s a percentage of people who will go absolutely feral at the
first confirmation of information about the next Persona game. The
runaway success of Persona 5 converted first-time players into
evangelical worshippers at the altar of Altus. (This is even to the
chagrin of Shin Megami Tensei fans, who will be quick to remind […]</p>

<p>Do you feel that? That chill in the air, that tingling sensation at
the back of your neck? It can only mean one thing. That’s right:
Halloween season is once again upon us! Here at Polygon, we love horror.

<p>date: 2024-10-07, updated: 2024-10-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>For a certain vintage of gamer who grew up painting and playing
Warhammer at the local mall’s Games Workshop, one color of paint stands
out from the rest: Goblin Green. The color, somewhere between a subtle
olive green and a vibrant grassy green, wasn’t only essential for those
collecting an army of orcs and goblins. […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-07, updated: 2024-10-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Xbox has announced sweeping changes to how Halo games are made. 343
Industries, the developer of Halo games since 2007, has rebranded as
Halo Studios, with a new internal organization and a new development
philosophy. As previously reported, 343’s in-house game engine Slipspace
is being abandoned in favor of Epic’s Unreal Engine 5. Halo Studios

<p>Nothing you’re about to read about Phoenix Springs — the new
point-and-click mystery game from Calligram Studio — is the full truth.
It’s the truth to me, for now. But really, it’s all up to
interpretation, and this is how I’ve chosen to represent that
interpretation to you, the reader. I can’t even tell you […]</p>

<p>October is spooky season, and the urge to settle in with some
pumpkin-scented candles with a seasonally fitting game is at an all-time
high. But while there are plenty of horror games out there for the brave
and the bold, what are the scaredy-cats to do this Halloween season? 
Never fear — we’ve collected a […]</p>

<p>Canadian filmmaker Pascal Plante was already dwelling on the eldritch
terrors that lurked below the surface of the dark web before the
COVID-19 pandemic sent him into lockdown. But by 2021, his
self-inflicted misery, combined with sitting at home for long stretches
of time, resulted in the screenplay for Red Rooms.  A brilliant
examination of […]</p>

<p>A good horror game scares you in the moment, but a great horror game
lingers in the back of your mind well past the end credits. We’ve been
blessed in recent years with a plethora of excellent horror games, but
with the arrival of October comes even more spooky games to get us nice

<p>Season 1 of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power promised a
balrog, and while the tragic sacrifice of King Durin in the mithril-rich
depths beneath Khazad-dûm might have been brief, it was certainly
spectacular. But there’s one thing it didn’t do, and that’s give Rings
of Power’s answer to a simple question: […]</p>

<p>If you’ve been on the fence about which PlayStation 5 to buy and have
ultimately decided against the PS5 Pro — either because of the price tag
or because you couldn’t nab the extra-gorgeous 30th anniversary edition
in time — the slimmed-down PS5 Digital Edition is on sale at both Amazon
and Target for $399.99 (was […]</p>
