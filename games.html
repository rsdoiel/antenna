<p>What do you call a person who likes video games but doesn’t play
video games? It might seem silly, but let’s talk. In sports, it’s normal
to like a thing without doing a thing. Take basketball. We’ve got: So it
follows that with video games, there are: Except that last one sounds

<p>Firewalk Studios’ hero shooter Concord, which launched on PlayStation
5 and Windows PC on Aug. 23, will be pulled from sale on Tuesday and
taken offline later this week in the wake of its disastrous launch, Sony

<p>Another summer has come and gone and while that can be a bummer, Xbox

<p>The best C9 loadout in the Black Ops 6 beta is one of two SMGs you

<p>The Ace Attorney Investigations Collection is closing a loop that’s
been open a long time. The first Investigations game, a spinoff of the
popular lawyer-based, detective-adjacent adventure games starring
Phoenix Wright, was released in 2009 (or 2010 in English). Despite
following fan-favorite prosecutorial rival Miles Edgeworth, it didn’t
sell well, particularly in the West. And […]</p>

<p>If you’re trying to get a house in Final Fantasy 14, you’ll need to

<p>Wooloo, the sheep Pokémon from Galar, can be found in the wild in
Pokémon Go. Yes, Wooloo can be shiny in Pokémon Go! The adorable sheep
orb, Wooloo, is a great shiny with its color scheme inverting.
Unfortunately, neither of these Pokémon see much use in PvP or PvE, but
they do look very good. […]</p>

<p>Lara Croft is “adventurous.” She “hits hard.” She’s “slick,” “sleek,”
“sexy,” and “proficient in dual-wielding pistols.” And the definition of
all those qualities is something different to every player that has
stepped into her boots over the last 30 years. So what does Lara Croft
need to be to be Lara Croft?  It’s a question […]</p>

<p>“Galar Calling” is the season-long Special Research for the “Max Out”

designers, has left the company after working there for over 30 years.

<p>Ditto is an elusive Pokémon in Pokémon Go, as it disguises itself and
you can’t actually just catch one straight-up. In order to find Ditto,
you’ll want to find the Pokémon that it currently disguises itself as.
For example, you may see a Diglett, and it’ll stay a Diglett once you
tap on it, but […]</p>

<p>Pokémon Go hosts a Spotlight Hour every Tuesday. This special event
sees spawn rates for one Pokémon boosted greatly. There’s also usually
some kind of doubled up bonus, like doubled candy or XP, during this
time, giving you an additional reason to check in. During September

<p>Using a raid schedule helps you work out which creatures to save your
raid passes (remote or otherwise) for in Pokémon Go. The raid targets
swap out every 10 days approximately, so you’ll definitely want to keep
track on who is coming next. If you’re unfamiliar with raids, they spawn

<p>Board games based on popular video game licenses, much like the

<p>The best XM4 loadout is likely to be the first gun you’ll kit out in

and best — you unlock. Despite only a faction of what’s in the […]</p>
