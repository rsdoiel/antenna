<p>date: 2025-07-19, updated: 2025-07-19, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Warframe is coming to a dining room table near you. Developer Digital
Extremes is collaborating with Pathfinder creator Paizo Games on a new
TTRPG module for Warframe, using Paizo’s Starfinder system. They’ve
created a standalone tabletop adventure that will launch in October
2025, and it’s called Warframe x Starfinder: Operation Orias. “This is

Layer fossil locations in Donkey Kong Bananza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-19, updated: 2025-07-19, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In Donkey Kong Bananza, you’ll need to find fossils on the Lagoon
Layer if you want to buy any swanky clothes or fur dye for Donkey Kong
and Pauline. While fossils like ammonite are just about everywhere (and
using DK’s sonar clap will help you find tons of them), there are some
harder-to-find fossils that […]</p>

<p>The Kong Bananza: City Smash challenge in Donkey Kong Bananza is a
little confusing initially, courtesy of the fractone running the
challenge telling you absolutely nothing about what to do. Smashing
concrete is only part of the job. If you want all three Banandium Gems
from this challenge, you’ll have to power through it with […]</p>

<p>In Donkey Kong Bananza, The Divide is the fourth layer that’ll you
descend into, and its full of pink and blue goo — and a few Banandium
Gems (golden bananas). The Divide is a fairly short level, so it’s
extremely easy to blitz through and miss all of the bananas hidden
inside. Make sure to […]</p>

<p>South Park, on the cusp of its 27th season, is caught in
behind-the-scenes turmoil that now threatens the show’s future. At the
center of the conflict is the $8 billion acquisition of Paramount by
David Ellison’s Skydance Media, a deal that has become a major
flashpoint for creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. The troubles […]</p>
