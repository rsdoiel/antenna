<p>date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Creating a brand-new franchise in a world of IP adaptations is hard
work. Just ask Christian Gudegast, writer-director of the Den of Thieves
franchise. The first movie in the series broke out as a surprise hit in
2018, leading to a sequel now out in theaters. Den of Thieves 2: Pantera
goes bigger and bolder, […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>One poorly understood aspect of the modern games industry is the
question of how players find new games. Particularly for smaller indie
devs with little or no advertising budget, it’s sort of miraculous that
any game can go from 0 players to thousands, let alone millions. Most
people give the credit for breakout hit indie […]</p>

<p>The Apothecary Diaries wasn’t just my favorite anime of 2024, but my

<p>For at least the last decade, video games have been offering profound
emotional single-player experiences, yet the recent surge of solo
