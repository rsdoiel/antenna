<p>date: 2024-09-15, updated: 2024-09-13, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There are only so many hours in a day. As best as one might try, it
can be difficult to keep up with the deluge of new titles that are
released every month, let alone the latest hundred-hour action RPG or
always-online service game. Luckily, there’s just as many fun — and most
importantly, short […]</p>

<p>One fateful college weekend, ActionMax, the genre spinoff of Cinemax,
programmed three down-and-dirty action films in a back-to-back marathon

has enough laugh-out loud gems to round out a list. And there’s a wide
variety of sub-genres to pick from: musical reboots, existential
animated kids’ movies, campy horror flicks, and even a DC parody. So
behold: the best comedy movies […]</p>

staggering wealth of options applies to anime too. With streaming
services like Crunchyroll and Funimation making it easier than ever to
keep up with seasonals, Netflix increasingly producing more original
anime, and an abundance of classic series now available to watch […]</p>

<p>There’s a whole lot going on in Tim Burton’s sequel to his 1988 hit
