<p>At Polygon, we want to introduce you do at least one thing we think
you’d love every single day. With so many games, movies, shows, and and
internet-based quick bites (or “quibis”) out there to experience, we
know it’s next to impossible to decide how to take a chance on the

<p>You’ll reach the Fountain of Confession in Indiana Jones and the
Great Circle as you progress “The Stolen Cat Mummy” adventure. Once you

<p>The Game Awards is simultaneously an awards show and a trailer
extravaganza in which game studios and publishers show off their
upcoming slates. Some of these trailers are for games that have already
been announced; others are what TGA host Geoff Keighley calls “world
premieres.” We already know from official announcements about what’s
confirmed to […]</p>

<p>Nicole Kidman may be right about going to the movies — we do go to
that place to laugh, to cry, to care, to see dazzling images on a huge
silver screen. And then, all but inevitably, we go home. And it’s there
we also find a place where stories can feel like magic. In […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>2024 was an oddball year for movies, heavily shaped by the disruption
of the 2023 Hollywood strikes and an industry hedging its bets against a
stronger 2025 by postponing many of its would-be blockbusters for a year
or more. That left a lot of open space at multiplexes, which responded
by booking smaller movies, from […]</p>

<p>2024 has been… a year. But at the end of the day, there was plenty to
sink our teeth into. We were delighted by the platforming possibilities
in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and Astro Bot, and the rich
storytelling of RPGs like Metaphor: ReFantazio and Like a Dragon:
Infinite Wealth. We loved the […]</p>

willing to truck themselves and a horse out to a remote New Zealand
shoot to become an extra in the legendary cavalry of Rohan. Stop me if

<p>In the 2002 movie Chicago, Catherine Zeta-Jones steps into the
