best scenic driving routes in the Forza Horizon games</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>What’s better than the idea of a road trip? It’s one of the most
romantic and liberating forms of travel — combining go-anywhere freedom
with the ability to quickly cover large distances and drink in the
landscape as you travel. In the real world, though, clogged roads and
energy efficiency concerns can dent your enjoyment; […]</p>

Creed Shadows guides and walkthroughs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows sees the long-running stealth series cover
perhaps its most requested setting: feudal Japan. While the previous
game Mirage was a modest entry as far as Ubisoft open-worlds go, Shadows
presents an adventure on the same vast scale as Odyssey and Valhalla –
with a dizzying number of activities to match. Whether this […]</p>

<p>Canon mode is a setting in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Like all the
familiar boot-up settings — subtitle preferences, game difficulty,
immersive mode, guided exploration mode, and so on — you’ll choose
whether or not to activate it before starting a new game. But the thing

<p>Early in the main story of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’ll be tasked

The Residence, Severance’s season 2 finale, and more new TV this
week</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>This week the big news is, of course, the Severance finale. After
really popping off this season and giving us more intrigue than ever,
we’re finally nearing the completion of the Cold Harbor file and god,
who knows what they’re going to do to Gemma (Dichen Lachman)? I’m on the
edge of my seat, and […]</p>

RTX 5080 is a great GPU that you probably can’t get right now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s a strange time to be reviewing an Nvidia graphics card. The
company sent me a GeForce RTX 5080 a month and a half ago, and in that
time, I’ve played a lot of games and watched a lot of GPU benchmark
comparison videos. But also in that time, Nvidia’s longtime competitor
AMD (which has […]</p>

the Hunter embodies the fatal flaw of Sony’s Spider-Man Universe</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>After seeing Kraven the Hunter in theaters in December 2024, I
couldn’t stop thinking about one detail of the movie. Kraven’s arrival
on Netflix this week — its debut for the streaming audience — brought it
back to the forefront of my mind. Kraven was a huge box-office flop,
scoring around $60 million worldwide on a […]</p>

secret twist</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s nice to be cozy. I’m a huge fan of being wrapped up in a big
blanket, sipping hot chocolate, and leisurely walks under colorful
autumn trees. Cozy games are also great, and they’re an increasingly
popular genre. While I’ve spent hours preparing the perfect farm in
Stardew Valley or exploring Bahari Bay in Palia, […]</p>
