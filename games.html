Wake 2’s anniversary update is full of reasons to replay the game</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, updated: 2024-10-21, from: Polygon Website</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-21, updated: 2024-10-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Nintendo’s Switch Online playtest hasn’t actually begun yet, but
details have already leaked online. Nintendo made a vague announcement
earlier in October inviting people to sign up for a Nintendo Switch
Online playtest; around 10,000 people were admitted into the test
program earlier this month. Nintendo shared very few details about the
mystery event, except […]</p>

<p>[Ed. note: This post gets into the end of Smile 2 to discuss the
future of the franchise. Read on only if you or the Smile demon haunting
you want to know what happened at the end of the movie.] It doesn’t take
much to see Smile 2’s ending coming. This is not an insult; […]</p>

<p>Do you feel that? That chill in the air, that tingling sensation at
the back of your neck? It can only mean one thing. That’s right:
Halloween season is once again upon us! Here at Polygon, we love horror.
We cover it all year round, whether it’s ranking the scariest new
releases of the year […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-21, updated: 2024-10-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There are currently 2,679 playable (for free!) demos for upcoming
games on Steam as part of Steam Next Fest — a feast for players and a
horrifying statistic if you’re hoping to launch a game next year. Valve
knows that’s entirely too many game demos, so they’ve posted a live
scoreboard where you can see […]</p>

Rural Life Adventure is exactly what it sounds like and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, updated: 2024-10-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Japanese Rural Life Adventure is what it says on the tin — it’s a
16-bit-style farming sim that takes place in the countryside, and it’s
filled with hallmarks of the genre: You leave the city to arrive at a
broken-down farm that you revitalize as you meet the townsfolk and
become a part of their […]</p>

<p>Despite being one of only two movies Quentin Tarantino said he would
have paid to see in theaters during the pandemic, Unhinged feels like a
movie that’s perfectly concocted for a great night on Netflix. It’s a
thriller that’s equal parts terrifying and silly, it’s got a movie star
giving a terrific performance as a […]</p>

Chris Pratt, will arrive in early 2025. In case you’re keeping count,
this is the third adaptation of the strange worlds developed by visual
