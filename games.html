deserve recognition at The Game Awards, too</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-25, updated: 2024-11-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>To me, mods represent some of the best work happening in video games.
I don’t just say this because these additions have allowed me to
introduce anime boys to Stardew Valley or put Margaret Thatcher’s grave
in Skyrim, but because modding has become a central part of gaming
culture and development.  In some cases, these […]</p>

working on a handheld PS5</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-25, updated: 2024-11-25, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Sony has started work on a portable console capable of playing
PlayStation 5 games, Bloomberg reports. Citing anonymous sources
familiar with the development of the device, Bloomberg said the new
handheld was likely years away from launch, and that Sony could still
decide to pull the plug on the project. Sony is said to be […]</p>

<p>Anyone who has read any of the Dune books, or watched any of the Dune
movies, or, heck, talked to anyone who has done either of those things
will tell you: The world of Dune is complicated. This is a grand sci-fi
universe, built on a few millennia of royal politicking, power plays,
manipulation, and […]</p>

<p>Half-Life 2 celebrated its 20th anniversary last week, with Valve
releasing a hefty update to the original game alongside a two-hour
documentary featuring interviews and a peek at never-before-seen footage
and concept art from the game’s development.  As a longtime fan of the
series who considers Half-Life 2 one of my most formative experiences

<p>In Wicked, wicked-witch-to-be Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) is ostracized
by her fellow Ozians because of her green skin and her magical powers.
But on the set of a big-budget Hollywood studio production that leans
heavily on visual effects instead of magic, she has her own viridescent
foe: green-screen technology. Vivid green backdrops — often referred to
as “chroma […]</p>

<p>The game industry is no stranger to boom-and-bust cycles, in which
scores of opportunistic developers fall over themselves to release
copycat competitors to the latest massive hit, and most, if not all,
fail. Perhaps the biggest instance — and certainly the most embarrassing
for almost everyone concerned — was the race to release the mythical

<p>Wild Area is another premier event in Pokémon Go, which is meant to
mimic the location with the same name from Pokémon Sword and Shield.
With a special fixation on electric- and poison-type Pokémon (and thus
bringing Gigantamax Toxtricity out to play), there are a lot of event
perks and interesting factors for this weekend-long […]</p>
