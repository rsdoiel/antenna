gifts for any budget</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>As we dive into the holiday season, it’s the perfect time to figure
out how to spread joy and love to the PC gamers in your life, who can be
especially tricky to find the right gift for. The market for great PC
gaming gifts is overwhelmingly vast, so to make it easier to shop,

Diablo 4 seasons will have content exclusive to Vessel of Hatred
owners</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Good news for Diablo 4 players who picked up Vessel of Hatred: future
seasons will have content exclusive to players who own the expansion,
Diablo franchise boss Rod Fergusson told Polygon in an interview earlier
this month. The goal, Fergusson said, is for expansion owners to
continue to feel they’re getting value from their purchase […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>[Ed. note: This story contains spoilers for Arcane season 2 Act 2.]
For eagle-eyed League of Legends fans, the reveal of Warwick in Act 2 of
Arcane season 2 was a heartbreak we saw coming; too many things lined up
just right between the disappearance of Powder and Vi’s father figure
and the creation of […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Not every story is meant to be experienced alone. Sometimes, the
protagonist needs a friend or a foil, and having companion characters is
a great way to achieve that. That’s why we took the time to look back on
the vast collection of gaming companions from over the years, and
narrowed the selection down to […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Anyone who has read any of the Dune books, or watched any of the Dune
movies, or, heck, talked to anyone who has done either of those things
will tell you: The world of Dune is complicated. This is a grand sci-fi
universe, built on a few millennia of royal politicking, power plays,
manipulation, and […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Few events in the Dune franchise are more critical to explaining its
universe than the Butlerian Jihad, so it may be a surprise to learn that
the fictional war still holds a lot of mystery for many Dune fans. 
Frank Herbert, who created the series, had a few vague explanations of
the Jihad, but never […]</p>

<p>Awards season approaches, but don’t tell that to the year in movies —
they’ve been on a hot streak all year long. There have been standout
genre movies, early awards contenders, crowd-pleasing blockbuster fare,
and everything in between so far this year. The last stretch of the year
is going to be jam-packed with even […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-17, updated: 2024-11-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Now that the Deadpool movie rights are back in Marvel Studios’ hands
and Deadpool has joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe (sorta, kinda, in
an elliptical way), one fan is hoping for a specific hero crossover.
Wētā FX’s Daniel Macarin, who was part of the VFX tech team on 2016’s
Deadpool and became the VFX supervisor on […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-17, updated: 2024-11-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Chasing down super rare cards is just one way to approach card
collecting. Depending on their interests, players can focus on tracking
down cards from a certain artist or period of time — or build a
collection around a single favorite Pokémon. As I play Pokémon Trading
Card Game Pocket, I’ve enjoyed building a collection […]</p>
