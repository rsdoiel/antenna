<h2 id="games-we-love-on-steam-deck">26 games we love on Steam Deck</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, updated: 2024-09-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Since it launched in 2022, the Steam Deck has quickly amassed a
reputation as one of the best, if not the best, handheld gaming
platforms on the market today— especially when considering the benefits
of the OLED version. With a library of games spanning much of Steam’s
vast storefront, a docking station to play games […]</p>

Bot’s credits are a joyful, playable homage to its developers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, updated: 2024-09-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Like Astro’s Playroom, Astro Bot has a playable end credits scene:
Team Asobi created a playful sequence to finish off its platforming
masterpiece. While the credits of Astro’s Playroom had a simple design,
they have their own own level in Astro Bot, called “Credits Clash.” As
many have written, Astro Bot is a stunning homage […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-09, updated: 2024-09-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is almost here, and yet nearly everything about it still
remains a mystery. In May 2024, Nintendo finally confirmed the existence
of the Switch successor, and assured fans that it will make an formal
announcement of it within the fiscal year, or in other words sometime
before early 2025. That’s a wide […]</p>

<p>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine serves as the official, final nail in the
coffin of 20th Century Fox’s Marvel movies, and the welcome party that
brings Deadpool and the X-Men into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But
there’s more to the movie than Deadpool mocking the MCU and calling
himself “Marvel Jesus,” come to save the Avengers. And […]</p>

<p>What’s the best movie I can watch on Netflix? We’ve all asked
ourselves this question, only to spend the next 15 minutes scrolling
through the streaming service’s oddly specific genre menus and getting
overwhelmed by the constantly shifting trend menus. Netflix’s huge
catalog of movies continues to expand day by day, week by week, month

<p>There’s a lot to love about the Nintendo Switch, not least of which
is the abundance of titles with local multiplayer features, making it a
great console for game night with friends or a casual play session with
a roommate. We’ve collected some of our favorite titles that allow for
good old-fashioned local play. It’s […]</p>

<p>It’s been a bit of a slow time of year for comedy movies, but 2024
has enough laugh-out loud gems to round out a list. And there’s a wide
variety of sub-genres to pick from: musical reboots, existential
animated kids’ movies, campy horror flicks, and even a DC parody. So
behold: the best comedy movies […]</p>

<p>It’s nothing new to note that there’s too much TV to watch, and this

services like Crunchyroll and Funimation making it easier than ever to
keep up with seasonals, Netflix increasingly producing more original
anime, and an abundance of classic series now available to watch […]</p>

<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree boasts big numbers: 110 minigames, seven
game boards, and an online mode that supports up to 20 players. But the
new Mario Party — the third entry in the franchise on Nintendo Switch
and the 19th overall — doesn’t appear to coast on volume. Instead, there
are inventive new twists on the […]</p>

<p>There’s a whole lot going on in Tim Burton’s sequel to his 1988 hit
Beetlejuice. Burton and his writers bring back some of the original
characters for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, and introduce a lot of new ones,
then cram them all together in half a dozen distracted, incomplete plot
lines. None of the characters, new or […]</p>

started shouting in anticipation of the concert that was set to begin,
but one lone voice cut through the roar: “Yaaaaaagoooooooooo!”  The
event was Hololive’s Breaking Dimensions concert on Aug. 24, a show
where digital performers known as Vtubers sing and dance live onstage
