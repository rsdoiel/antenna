fan got the Pope to sign his Popplio card</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>One recent visitor to the Vatican may have pulled off a historical
first: getting the sitting Pope to autograph a Pokémon card. But that
Pokémon fan’s interaction with Pope Leo XIV has another layer, because
the choice of Pokémon card is so, well, choice. On Saturday, Pope Leo
XIV welcomed visitors from across Europe and […]</p>

‘best’ Mario Kart World kart is ugly</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>For some people, Mario Kart World is a nonstop cow party. For others,
it’s a slow stroll that’s periodically interrupted by lightning strikes.
But based on the emerging “meta” for Mario Kart World, the open-world
kart competition has been diminished into a droll series of clones. If
you’re in the know, you’re probably playing with […]</p>

is the ultimate rebuke of studios killing their online games</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>All too often, publishers pull the plug on video games, whether that
means delisting them from digital storefronts or shutting multiplayer
servers off. The Stop Killing Games movement, spearheaded by YouTuber
Ross Scott, is fighting against publishers killing their games, what it
calls “a radical assault on consumer rights and even the concept of
ownership […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>If anyone can lay claim to the most iconic track in Nintendo’s
jubilant kart racer, it’s probably Twitch streamer Technical. The
22-year-old holds the distinction of having the fastest possible run
time in Mario Kart 8’s Rainbow Road, both for original version and the
Deluxe re-release on Switch. Naturally, the speed demon has been
grinding […]</p>

proof</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>By now, it’s a familiar pattern: A new Jurassic Park franchise movie
movie comes out during the summer, garnering middling and sometimes
exhausted-sounding reviews. Yes, it has some decent special effects and
maybe a fun set piece or two, but it’s not a patch on Steven Spielberg’s
1993 original. Terms like “out of ideas,” “incurious,” […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 9 fans have a lot to be excited for 2025, on the
occasion of the game’s 25th anniversary. In a year already filled with
Final Fantasy flavor due to the success of the Magic: The Gathering
Final Fantasy set, the series ninth game is back in the spotlight. From
a possible remake in […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In 2018, Universal Pictures’ Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom gave the
25-year-old Jurassic Park franchise its most ambitious, startling shift
since the first movie brought dinosaurs into the modern world. Until
that point in the series, the various resurrected dino species had been
confined to parks, islands, and experimental facilities, which hapless
humans had to enter […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription is likely the best deal around:
For a fraction of the price of a full game, you get access to hundreds
of titles every month, some of which are brand new. But when video games
cost millions to make, and news of studio layoffs are constant, you
don’t need to look […]</p>

<p>The second and final season of Netflix’s adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s
The Sandman, which kicked off July 3, is the first project to move
forward since the writer was accused of sexual assault, leading to
pauses in production on Good Omens season 3, Disney’s adaptation of The
Graveyard Book, and many other adaptations of his […]</p>

<p>As Warner Bros. Games reworks its gaming department, the company has
released DC Worlds Collide, a free-to-play mobile RPG, on Monday, July
7. The game is a squad-based experience set in the DC Universe, where
players can assemble their favorite heroes and villains from over 70
playable characters to engage in 3D turn-based battles against […]</p>

<p>Tophat Gudetama hides in a different spot in Hello Kitty Island
Adventure every week, with new weeks beginning on Monday. Pochacco will
task you with finding this dapper Gudetama specifically as part of a
quest per week for the first two weeks (“The Laziest Egg” and “The

Latif turned to Alan Moore’s comics to inspire him as Nautilus’ Captain
Nemo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-06, updated: 2025-07-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>AMC Plus’ ongoing adventure series Nautilus is set before the events
of Jules Verne’s classic science fiction novel 20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea, following a young Nemo shortly after he built his submarine. That
gave Star Trek: Discovery’s Shazad Latif the chance to make the
mysterious captain his own. “I had free rein, because we […]</p>
