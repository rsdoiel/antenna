legend behind Dragon’s Dogma leaves after 30 years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Hideaki Itsuno, one of Capcom’s most experienced and successful
designers, has left the company after working there for over 30 years.
Itsuno was a key steward of the Devil May Cry series and the creator and
director of Dragon’s Dogma and its recent sequel, Dragon’s Dogma 2; his
departure leaves a question mark hanging over […]</p>

Ditto disguises list for September 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Ditto is an elusive Pokémon in Pokémon Go, as it disguises itself and
you can’t actually just catch one straight-up. In order to find Ditto,
you’ll want to find the Pokémon that it currently disguises itself as.
For example, you may see a Diglett, and it’ll stay a Diglett once you
tap on it, but […]</p>

Go Spotlight Hour schedule for September 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Pokémon Go hosts a Spotlight Hour every Tuesday. This special event
sees spawn rates for one Pokémon boosted greatly. There’s also usually
some kind of doubled up bonus, like doubled candy or XP, during this
time, giving you an additional reason to check in. During September
2024, with the way the dates line up, we […]</p>

Go raid schedule for September 2024’s Legendary and Mega Pokémon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Using a raid schedule helps you work out which creatures to save your
raid passes (remote or otherwise) for in Pokémon Go. The raid targets
swap out every 10 days approximately, so you’ll definitely want to keep
track on who is coming next. If you’re unfamiliar with raids, they spawn
in gyms from 10 a.m. […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Pokémon Go has its own version of the notorious Team Rocket, called
Team Go Rocket. In this Pokémon Go guide, we’ll break down how to find
leaders Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo and take them down. Below, we list their
parties and strategies as it stands in September 2024, with the most
recent changes following the […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Giovanni’s team had a refresh in Pokémon Go following the arrival of
the summer “Adventure Week: Taken Over” event. As it stands in September
2024, following an update rolled out on August 7, Giovanni’s team sees
several possibilities, including a finale against Cresselia, the latest
legendary to see the Shadow treatment. For those who want […]</p>

Effect: The Board Game prioritizes tactical action over space opera</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-08-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Board games based on popular video game licenses, much like the
recently released Borderlands, are — more often than not — a bit shit.
The worst offenders are those that seek to directly port the gameplay
experience note-for-note from a PC or console over to an analog format.
That’s why I find Mass Effect: The […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The best XM4 loadout is likely to be the first gun you’ll kit out in
the Black Ops 6 beta, because as with the case with almost every Call of
Duty game, the jack-of-all-trades assault rifle is one of the first —
and best — you unlock. Despite only a faction of what’s in the […]</p>

<p>In 2024, you can’t throw a stone without hitting an anime fan — not
literally, of course. But what once felt like an exclusive club has
become a mainstream, global phenomenon, appearing on everything from
major streaming services to giant movie screens. And millions of today’s
anime fans have the same place to thank for […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-01, updated: 2024-09-01, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The universe of The Lord of the Rings is extremely complicated. There
are Valar and Maiar, magic trees everywhere, ambiguously powerful rings,
and at least two Dark Lords who want to throw the world into chaos. One
thing that J.R.R. Tolkien always made plain in his universe, however, is
the difference between the right side […]</p>

<p>Thriller fans know by now to keep an eye out for new Jeremy Saulnier
movies. From his over-the-top horror debut Murder Party to the
deceptively low-key one-two punch confrontation dramas of Blue Ruin and
Green Room to the viciously chilly William Giraldi adaptation Hold the
Dark, Saulnier specializes in moody films punctuated by shockingly
graphic […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-01, updated: 2024-08-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In the early hours of the morning, a TikTok video titled “Does
Japanese with a California valley girl accent = Simlish?” popped up on
my For You page. The algorithm knows me too well. In the video, creator
oyasumisushi tests the hypothesis by quickly studying up on the
California valley girl accent (think Cher in […]</p>

<p>Even with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm serving you new movies,
new TV shows, and original programming tailored to your viewing habits,
the streaming service’s fire hose of content makes what’s coming
difficult to parse. This month brings the movie adaptation of 2005 YA
dystopian novel Uglies. Better late than never! There’s also new seasons
of Emily […]</p>
