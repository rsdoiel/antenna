<p>date: 2025-06-15, updated: 2025-06-13, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>While we’ve had plenty of superhero games come out over the past
decade and a half (and I’m always down for more), most have either been
open-world adventures or fighting games. I’m as excited as anyone for
the upcoming Marvel Tōkon and Invincible VS, but I’m also ready for a
little something different. That’s where […]</p>

<p>Following Grand Theft Auto 6’s retreat into 2026, last week’s launch
of Nintendo Switch 2 will likely stand as the gaming event of 2025. And
at the center of that launch is Mario Kart World, an ambitious sequel to

<p>Hell is Us has been on my radar since it was first announced in April

<p>Flour Sand is one of the most dangerous items in Dune: Awakening, as

<p>Erythrite Crystals are an essential mid-game item in Dune: Awakening.
You’ll need them for crafting cobalt paste, which you use for several
