<h2 id="polygons-most-requested-feature-is-now-live">Polygon’s most
requested feature is now live</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, updated: 2024-09-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>When we launched Polygon’s new design, I promised that it would be
the first of many changes. And I promised that your feedback would shape
the site’s future. A month after launch, I’m pleased to share that one
of your most requested features is live: a page that collects every new
story on Polygon in […]</p>

<h2 id="diablo-4s-item-shop-has-made-150-million">Diablo 4’s item shop
has made $150 million</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, updated: 2024-09-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>If you ever stumble across some genuinely interesting data about how
much money a video game has made, you can be sure you’re not supposed to
know it. So it is with the apparently accidental revelation that Diablo
4, released in June 2023, has made $1 billion in revenue to date,
including over $150 million […]</p>

27 best retro games for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack
subscribers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, updated: 2024-09-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In 2021, Nintendo added an additional tier to its Nintendo Switch
Online subscription service in the form of its Expansion Pack, which
brought Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games to the already extensive list
of NES and SNES titles. In February 2023, during a Nintendo Direct
presentation, that list got even bigger: Nintendo added Game […]</p>

is a proper British detective mystery with Fallout: New Vegas vibes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, updated: 2024-09-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Like limited-time public demos, media hands-on preview builds often
feature handy text boxes that flash on the screen to inform the player
that only a few minutes remain. During my half-hour with Atomfall at
Gamescom, one appeared while I was chatting with the flat-capped
landlord of a painstakingly British pub. Alf Buckshaw of the Grendel’s

<p>date: 2024-09-15, updated: 2024-09-13, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There are only so many hours in a day. As best as one might try, it
can be difficult to keep up with the deluge of new titles that are
released every month, let alone the latest hundred-hour action RPG or
always-online service game. Luckily, there’s just as many fun — and most
importantly, short […]</p>

history of the action classic Blood and Bone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, updated: 2024-09-15, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>One fateful college weekend, ActionMax, the genre spinoff of Cinemax,
programmed three down-and-dirty action films in a back-to-back marathon
of cable curation that would change my life. First was Universal
Soldier: Day of Reckoning, a one-in-a-million blend of science fiction,
horror, and R-rated action. Then Undisputed II: Last Man Standing, a
milestone moment for the […]</p>
