Piece’s Tony Tony Chopper revealed in all his furry live-action-ish
glory</h2>

<p>After a tease in Netflix’s One Piece season 2 announcement way back

the Galaxy, Vol. 3, July’s […]</p>

Bring Her Back’s most stomach-churning shot happened</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-31, updated: 2025-05-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There’s a scene in Bring Her Back, the latest A24 horror movie from
Talk To Me writer-directors (and twin brothers) Danny and Michael
Philippou, that’s so violently grotesque, I actually closed my eyes to
shut it out. Trying to deny what was going on on the screen just made
what was going on in the […]</p>

<p>If you play indie games, you may have noticed Strange Scaffold’s
incredible hit rate. Every single one of the studio’s games — from 
Clickolding, I Am Your Beast, and most recently, Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles: Tactical Takedown — has ended up somewhere within the
“Positive” ranking system on Steam (with several achieving “Very
Positive” or […]</p>

Last of Us season 2 failed Ellie in service of safe TV</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-31, updated: 2025-05-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Without interactivity, the Ellie Williams that players know from the
Last of Us games was never going to be the same person as the character
who appeared on a television screen on Sunday nights. But by the time
season 2 of HBO’s The Last of Us reached its finale, it became evident
that the TV […]</p>
