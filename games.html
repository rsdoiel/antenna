one big snub in the Game Awards nominations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Game Awards aren’t known for much in the way of shock and
surprise, and so it proved with the 2024 nominees — a fairly
well-rounded list in which most of the year’s best-reviewed and
best-loved games got some love. But there was one title very striking
for its (almost) complete absence: Dragon Age: The […]</p>

<p>The “Return to Sanctuary” event in Diablo 4 includes a host of
different in-game occurrences, all of which start on Tuesday, Nov. 19,
and last for different amounts of time. Below, we’ll break down each of
the major events coming to Diablo 4 for the rest of 2024, including a

<p>date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>As the use of generative artificial intelligence in tabletop
proliferates, there appears to be a rapidly growing divide between
consumers and creators regarding its ethical implementation.
Simultaneously, there are key differences between how the three major
crowdfunding platforms — specifically BackerKit, Gamefound, and
Kickstarter — treat the technology. A recent project, a card game called

<p>Fields of Mistria’s first big patch is out Monday, adding romance,
dating, and rideable animals to the popular farming and life simulator.
It’s developer NPC Studio’s first major update for the game, which was

<p>The Star Trek franchise is a flexible one, in which the best Trek
series find time to be both serious and silly, to host trial episodes,
action-adventure, submarine thrillers, and even the occasional mystery
(with or without Data dressed up as Sherlock Holmes).  Maybe that’s what
makes Beadle &amp; Grimm’s latest project, currently seeking funding

<p>Shortly after The Game Awards creator and host Geoff Keighley

<p>Toxel has made its global debut in Pokémon Go as part of November
2024’s “Into the Wild” event. The Gen 8 electric- and poison-type baby

<p>Good news for Diablo 4 players who picked up Vessel of Hatred: future

<p>Few events in the Dune franchise are more critical to explaining its
