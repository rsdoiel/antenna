horror movies of the year, ranked by scariness</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-23, updated: 2025-04-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The year is off to a great start, at least as far as horror movies
are concerned. There are films about family secrets ranging from
ridiculously silly to heartbreaking and tragic. There’s also a
holiday-themed slasher, a good old-fashioned summer camp slasher, and a
few more unconventional movies that might surprise you. To help you

<p>date: 2025-04-23, updated: 2025-04-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>By halfway through the first episode of Andor’s second season,
fledgling rebel Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) has run across a complication
on his latest mission: a band of rebel soldiers who see him as a threat
rather than an ally. In fact, they seem to see just about everything as
a threat: the critters in […]</p>

<p>Andor has returned for its second season and it’s just as fantastic

<p>A new idle clicker game has overtaken Banana on the Steam charts.
That’s Bongo Cat, published by Irox Games, which takes the general idea
of Banana and the rest of the genre and tweaks it a little. You don’t
really play Bongo Cat, necessarily; the cute little kitty lives as an
overlay on your screen, […]</p>

is going after the leaker behind major Pokémon ‘Teraleak’</h2>

<p>Nintendo is asking a California court to force Discord to give up the
identity of the person behind last year’s massive Pokémon data breach,
known among the Pokémon community as the “Teraleak.” It’s called the
Teraleak because of just how much information was released online; the
leaker claimed to have source code for the upcoming […]</p>

Sinners</h2>

<p>Hands down, Ryan Coogler’s 1930s-set crime film/historical
thriller/vampire horror-show Sinners is one of the best movies of 2025
so far. The Black Panther and Fruitvale Station director has made a
project that’s simultaneously audacious and personal, the kind of
big-swing original story that cinephiles are always clamoring for around
the edges of the endless franchise […]</p>

<p>Look Outside is a horror game with teeth — quite literally: They’re
bursting through my neighbors’ skin and gnashing on anything that gets
too close. Look Outside was originally released on March 21, and the
game has since consistently floated to the top of my social media feeds
as people marvel about the scares this […]</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is doomed to forever be compared to Overwatch. It’s a
team-based shooter with heroes, and some of those heroes happen to have
a lot in common with the ones in Overwatch. NetEase has never directly
said Blizzard’s game was an inspiration, but a now-removed line in
Marvel Rivals’ code confirms that someone on […]</p>
