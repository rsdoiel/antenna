<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe did not end with Avengers: Endgame or
the Phase 3 wrap-up feature Spider-Man: No From Home, but it did take a
break for a few years before Phases 4 and 5, and that return has been
increasingly shaky. Phase 4 saw Marvel taking its first big steps into

<p>Marvel’s new trailer is a rapid-fire compilation of a bunch of new

<p>Marvel’s Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, a collision of the Fox X-Men
universe and MCU proper, is the biggest hit of the year so far. In fact,
14 weeks after its premiere, it’s still in 300 theaters, scraping a few

<p>The best AK-74 loadout in Black Ops 6 (note: not the AK-47) bridges
the gap between close-range combat and fighting at long distances
because, while it packs a serious punch, it takes some work to control
the recoil. In previous Call of Duty games, the AK-74 has featured as an
SMG instead, whereas the AK-47 […]</p>

<p>The best Tanto .22 loadout in Black Ops 6 takes advantage of this
incredibly slow-firing SMG to turn it into one of the best guns in the

<p>Many fans of tabletop miniatures gaming feel as though the largest
franchises in the space have, sadly, lost their edge. Mordheim

<p>As soon as you unlock the Jackal PDW in Black Ops 6, you should start

enemies to shreds when kitted out correctly. While all of the SMGs

<p>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, now streaming on Netflix, is one movie

<p>The best C9 loadout in Black Ops 6 may seem familiar, because it is
