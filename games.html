<p>date: 2024-12-26, updated: 2024-12-23, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Live-service gaming is in a difficult, transitional moment. Even as
the sector consumes more and more millions of player hours, successful
new launches are few and far between, and the frequency of shutdowns has
increased. Franchises like Destiny and Overwatch have pivoted to
free-to-play models in an attempt to keep their player numbers buoyant,

<p>Giratina is a hot target in Pokémon Go raids, and whether you’re

<p>Mega Abomasnow is one of several Mega Pokémon that you can battle in

scenes recreated for video games</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-22, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Movies and video games have always had a somewhat tumultuous
relationship. From the famous failings of video game movie adaptations
to the even more famous struggle to make good movie versions of games,
it’s rare that the two mediums see eye to eye. Which is why it’s so
funny that there are a few rare […]</p>

Terror Camp</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-22, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>All is well at Terror Camp. The author Julian Sancton has just
finished speaking about his book Madhouse at the End of the Earth, which
documents the ill-equipped and ill-fated Belgian Antarctic expedition of
1897. The conference attendees are watching via Zoom, and flooding the
accompanying Discord chat with hearts and hand-clap emojis when Allegra

is now shamelessly owning the Star Wars Holiday Special</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-22, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>For decades, the Star Wars Holiday Special was a misbegotten artifact
of a specific era of network TV variety-show thinking, and Lucasfilm
seemed content to pretend it never happened. Fans considered it a black
mark on George Lucas’ franchise, and made it the butt of endless fandom
jokes. But that’s changed over the past decade […]</p>

<p>Pokémon Go’s “Dual Destiny” season has begun, lasting from Dec. 3
until March 4, 2025. This means that there’s a new set of Special

<p>date: 2024-12-22, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Pokémon Go is having the second half of its holiday event (literally
called “Holiday Part 2”) from Dec. 22-27, adding more festive Pokémon to
the already-long list of costumed critters, alongside some pretty good
event bonuses. All players will be able to get doubled XP from catching
Pokémon and 50% more XP from raiding. All […]</p>

Phone is the perfect game for (free) holiday family fun</h2>

<p>The trendsetters online might have moved on from playing Gartic
Phone, but my family has not. Developed by Onrizon, Gartic Phone
combines the children’s game Telephone with the board game Pictionary.
It might sound a bit simple, but this lighthearted game is a genuine
delight. More importantly, it’s the perfect game to share with family
