Hideo Kojima, but everyone is going to like Death Stranding 2</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-23, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Hideo Kojima is annoyed that people like Death Stranding 2: On the
Beach. In a recent interview with Edge magazine, the video game auteur
lamented that test scores for the new game were much higher than for the
divisive 2019 original, which six out of ten testers said was terrible.
“Everyone seems to be positive” […]</p>

adds a new draft format perfect for Commander groups</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-23, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Commander has been Magic: the Gathering’s most popular format for
years, shaping the way the game is developed from the creation of
ready-to-play decks to accompany each new set to the preponderance of
legends players can build their own decks around. Wizards of the Coast
has only been increasing its focus on the format, taking […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-22, updated: 2025-06-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Three days is all I had until Jan, Jan, Jan, and Jan burned to a
crisp.  I awoke and went to the elevator where Jan Miner passed by
muttering something about the “fucked-up world we live it.” Agreed. I
noticed an “Alter Rebellion” brewing on my tasks list. Great. I went
down to the kitchen […]</p>

<p>The latest trailer of Ranma ½ Season 2 not only confirms that the new
season will premiere in October 2025, but also introduces new characters
like Mousse and Ukyo Kuonji, who are joining the cast in the upcoming
season of the show. Adapted by studio MAPPA and published by Netflix,
the new season will also […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-22, updated: 2025-06-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Every June, the video game industry gets together in Los Angeles to
tout its wares to the press and public. What used to be a massive
festival of corporate marketing spend at the E3 trade show has downsized
considerably to a handful of livestreams organized around Geoff
Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but it’s still an […]</p>

knockoffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, updated: 2025-06-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There are five official Die Hard movies. Given star Bruce Willis’
retirement from acting, it’s likely to stay that way for the foreseeable
future. (Don’t rule out The Wholly Redundant Adventures of Young John
McClane coming to theaters in summer 2035.) Regardless, the series will
live on indefinitely, not just through the endlessly beloved,
rewatchable, […]</p>
