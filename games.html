frogs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>What if we just quit our jobs, moved back home, and started up a frog
refuge with our childhood pals? That’s the premise of developer Humble
Reeds’ creature collecting game Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge. And it’s a
delight. If you’ve played Neko Atsume, you’ll understand the base
gameplay of Kamaeru — attract frogs to your […]</p>

<p>If you’ve used Mario Paint’s composer feature to create anything
worth listening to, I’m in awe of you. And if you’ve used it to cover an
entire album, like YouTuber fartmancomposer did with Charli xcx’s Brat,
I’m even more in awe. The real album took the charts by storm all summer

<p>This is the discount that I have been personally waiting for all
summer. The 2023 remake of Resident Evil 4 is on sale for $21.99 through
Amazon for Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PS4. That’s nearly
half off its $39.99 list price 21% off its more typical $29.99 sales

<p>date: 2024-10-16, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve seen much from Wizards of the Coast and
Archetype Entertainment’s Exodus, the upcoming sci-fi role-playing game
from former BioWare developers. Sure, the studio has been dropping lore
and concept art since revealing Exodus at last year’s The Game Awards,
but a new trailer for the game released Wednesday offers […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-16, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Tuesday Knight Games’ award-winning Mothership is a hit. The science
fiction horror role-playing game is one of the few independently
produced tabletop RPGs to go from online sensation to a real physical
product available on store shelves. Co-creator Sean McCoy tells Polygon
that part of that success is thanks to a dedicated community, including

<p>date: 2024-10-16, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Exactly one year from its announcement — in keeping with Analogue’s
tradition of making major announcements on October 16 — comes news on
the price, preorder and shipping dates for the Analogue 3D, the boutique
clone console maker’s Nintendo 64-flavored variant. First, the bad news:

<p>With a lore that spans roughly a millennium of human history,
Catalyst Game Labs’ tabletop game Battletech can be very daunting to get
into. Fear not, however, if you don’t have 8-plus hours to watch a deep

<p>We’ve written previously about Govee’s smart TV lights, which mimic
the colors from your screen and splash them behind the TV. They’re a
great and somewhat affordable way to make watching movies or playing

<p>I always breathe a sigh of relief after the announcement of a new
Aardman Animation project. The studio behind some of the most
imaginative stop-motion projects of the last 50 years has never been a
household name or box-office titan like Walt Disney Animation, but
founders Peter Lord and David Sproxton’s quirky claymation company

<p>As genre enthusiasts continue to heal from the proliferation of the
label “elevated horror” over the last decade, A24, which defined the
made-up prestige subgenre with films like Hereditary and The Witch, is
not looking back. The studio’s new movie The Legend of Ochi affirms the
strategy — it’s pure fantasy, elevated only by a […]</p>

<p>“Magnetic Study” is an electric-type focused event taking place in
the “Max Out” season of Pokémon Go. Running Oct. 15-17, each day of the

<p>date: 2024-10-16, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>This is, arguably, the moment Microsoft’s $68.7 billion acquisition
of Activision Blizzard finally bears fruit for Game Pass subscribers.
Beyond Diablo 4, few Activision Blizzard titles have made it to the

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, plus a major jewel of […]</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has been continually

<p>Spiritborn are the agile, monk-like characters in Diablo 4, and are
