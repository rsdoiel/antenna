find that adorable Astro Bot controller?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, updated: 2024-09-06, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Astro Bot, the second full-fledged title featuring the de facto
PlayStation mascot and a very good Nintendo-tier platformer, has
arrived. To commemorate the occasion, PlayStation has launched a limited
edition DualSense controller fashioned after the blue-eyed bot. The
$79.99 controller is technically available now, but you might have a
difficult time finding one. Links are […]</p>

<p>The only thing better than a durable, braided USB-C cable is one that
can charge two gadgets at the same time. That’s exactly what Anker’s
2-in-1 USB-C cable does, and it’s $4 off its normal $25.99 price if
you’re an Amazon Prime member. With it, you can charge a duo of gadgets

<p>There are secret exits in several Astro Bot levels, all of which will

<p>The appeal of Konami’s recently released Castlevania collection is,
in theory, that it’s a new way to play three meaty Castlevania

Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia). But the highlight for me, an

takeaway directors Louise Hooper and Sanaa Hamri and writer Glenise

<p>In 2024, you can’t throw a stone without hitting an anime fan — not
literally, of course. But what once felt like an exclusive club has

major streaming services to giant movie screens. And millions of today’s
anime fans have the same place to thank for […]</p>

<p>The universe of The Lord of the Rings is extremely complicated. There
are Valar and Maiar, magic trees everywhere, ambiguously powerful rings,
and at least two Dark Lords who want to throw the world into chaos. One
thing that J.R.R. Tolkien always made plain in his universe, however, is
the difference between the right side […]</p>

<p>Thriller fans know by now to keep an eye out for new Jeremy Saulnier
movies. From his over-the-top horror debut Murder Party to the
deceptively low-key one-two punch confrontation dramas of Blue Ruin and
Green Room to the viciously chilly William Giraldi adaptation Hold the
Dark, Saulnier specializes in moody films punctuated by shockingly
graphic […]</p>

<p>In the early hours of the morning, a TikTok video titled “Does
Japanese with a California valley girl accent = Simlish?” popped up on
my For You page. The algorithm knows me too well. In the video, creator
oyasumisushi tests the hypothesis by quickly studying up on the
California valley girl accent (think Cher in […]</p>

<p>Even with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm serving you new movies,
new TV shows, and original programming tailored to your viewing habits,
the streaming service’s fire hose of content makes what’s coming
difficult to parse. This month brings the movie adaptation of 2005 YA
dystopian novel Uglies. Better late than never! There’s also new seasons
of Emily […]</p>
