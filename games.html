<p>date: 2025-03-11, updated: 2025-03-10, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Netflix’s Devil May Cry series is less than a month away, and if the
new trailer is any indication, it’s certainly set to live up to the
spirit of the video games. Netflix released a new trailer Tuesday, which
gave us our longest look yet at the series and maybe even a hint at what

<p>At Polygon, we want to introduce you to at least one thing we think
you’d love every single day. With so many games, movies, shows, and
internet-based quick bites (or “quibis”) out there to experience, we

<p>date: 2025-03-11, updated: 2025-03-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The weekly reset time in Destiny 2 is a little odd compared to some
other live service games. Instead of having a consistent reset time,
Destiny 2’s reset shifts with the yearly daylight savings changes. That
means the answer to “what time is the reset this week” actually changes
twice a year. However, the weekly […]</p>

Rosenfeld told Polygon, he’s fine with always being known as “the

personal. A game that feels both intimate and emotional, and one that
