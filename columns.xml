The artificial intelligence bros are scraping the net and they don’t care if the small websites fall over or not for days on end. But you already know all that. It’s the founding story of my [Butlerian Jihad](Butlerian_Jihad).

The setup I use is documented [elsewhere](https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index). If you have a different setup and would still like to access the list of IP addresses I’m currently blocking, maybe to block them yourself, after careful review… You do carefully review these lists, right? … Right? 😏 Well, in any case, also as a kind of explanation of what is happening, here are some files I’m regenerating every hour:

- [blocked IPv4 address ranges](/share/1w-ban-ipv4.txt)
- [blocked IPv6 address ranges](/share/1w-ban-ipv6.txt)
- [blocked ASN](/share/1w-ban-asn.txt)
- [the script](/admin/publish-f2b.sh)

Note that I’m blocking the ASN by looking up all the IP address ranges they are managing and blocking them.
So the list of address ranges is the result but the list of ASNs is the intent.

        <a href="https://exe.dev/">exe.dev</a> is a new hosting service that, for $20/month, gives you up to 25 VMs "that share 2 CPUs and 8GB RAM". Everything happens over SSH, including creating new VMs. Once configured you can sign into your exe.dev VMs like this:</p>

      <source:markdown>**[SSH has no Host header](https://blog.exe.dev/ssh-host-header)**

 [exe.dev](https://exe.dev/) is a new hosting service that, for $20/month, gives you up to 25 VMs &#34;that share 2 CPUs and 8GB RAM&#34;. Everything happens over SSH, including creating new VMs. Once configured you can sign into your exe.dev VMs like this:

```
ssh simon.exe.dev

```

Here&#39;s the clever bit: when you run the above command `exe.dev` signs you into your VM of that name... but they don&#39;t assign every VM its own IP address and SSH has no equivalent of the Host header, so how does their load balancer know _which_ of your VMs to forward you on to?

The answer is that while they don&#39;t assign a unique IP to every VM they _do_ have enough IPs that they can ensure each of your VMs has an IP that is unique to your account.

If I create two VMs they will each resolve to a separate IP address, each of which is shared with many other users. The underlying infrastructure then identifies my user account from my SSH public key and can determine which underlying VM to forward my SSH traffic to.

      <title>Pluralistic: The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating unoptimizability as a habit (22 Jan 2026)</title>
      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/22/optimized-for-unoptimizability/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating ungovernability as a habit: Get good at being on hold. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: "Ventus"; Woody Guthrie v Trump's dad; Tory MP v poppers. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating ungovernability as a habit (permalink) I am on record as being skeptical of the notion that if you shop very carefully, you can make society better. "Conscious consumption" is not a tool for structural change, and any election that requires you to "vote with your wallet" is always won by the people with the thickest wallets (statistically speaking, that's not you): https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/13/consumption-choices/#marginal-benefits Now, that's not to say that boycotts are useless. But a boycott is a structured and organized campaign. The Montgomery bus boycott wasn't a matter of a bunch of people waking up one morning and saying, "You know what, fuck it, I'm gonna walk today": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott The Montgomery bus boycott was an organized project, put together by a powerful membership organization, the NAACP, that demanded far more of its members than merely shopping very carefully. The boycott was the end stage of an organized resistance, not a substitute for it. The problem with "conscious consumption" is that it comes out of the neoliberal tradition in which every political matter is supposedly determined by your individual actions, and not your actions as part of a union or other political institution that works as a bloc to overthrow the status quo. "Conscious consumption" arises out of the tradition that gave us Margaret Thatcher's maxim, "There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first." Any attempt to change society by shopping very carefully is destined to fail, but it's worse than that. Because "shopping very carefully" never makes systemic change, its practitioners inevitably decide the reason they're not seeing the change they yearn for is that their allies aren't shopping carefully enough. This turns the careful shopper into a cop who polices other people's consumption, demanding that they stop eating some foodstuff or using Twitter or watching HBO Max. Squabbling over whether using a social media network makes you a Nazi generates far more heat than light &#8211; so much heat that it incinerates the solidarity you need to actually fight Nazis. Which is not an argument against boycotts! Boycotts work. If boycotts didn't work, then genocide apologists wouldn't be apoplectic over the BDS movement: https://bdsmovement.net/ But a "boycott" isn't the same thing as "you and your social circle deciding that buying the wrong product makes you a Bad Person and then devoting your energies to scolding your allies for choosing Coke instead of Pepsi." Boycotts are downstream of organizing; they are not a substitute for organizing. There is such a thing as society. Now, all that said, I will confess: I sometimes do something that looks a lot like "shopping very carefully," and when I do, I derive enormous satisfaction from it (but I am always careful not to mistake my tiny victories for political action). But I get it, honestly, I do. Sometimes, "shopping very carefully" is a way to eke out a tiny, personal victory in the face of overwhelming odds against a wildly overmatched opponent. That feels very good. One example would be patronizing my local repair shop (or fixing my stuff myself). The big structural barriers to repair are things like "parts pairing": https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification And manufacturers who abuse trademark law to get CBP to seize refurbished parts at the border: https://www.shacknews.com/article/108049/apple-repair-critic-louis-rossmann-takes-on-us-customs-counterfeit-battery-seizure The repair problem isn't that your neighbors are "sheeple" who've had their minds warped by a "throwaway society." The problem is that technical and legal countermeasures have made repair so hard and unprofitable that getting your stuff fixed is more expensive and time-consuming than it needs to be. That said: I love going to my local repair shop. I love fixing things on my own. It's great. It makes me feel great. I think you should do it because it may make you feel great, too, and it'd be nice for you to support your local fix-it place, but let's not pretend that we'll change society that way. Here's another example: for the past couple years, I've been navigating a (thankfully very treatable) cancer diagnosis. The fact that my cancer is very treatable doesn't mean it's easily treated. America's shitty, for-profit healthcare system is terrible at the best of times, and nearly unnavigable when coping with a complex condition that crosses a lot of disciplinary lines and requires access to specialized, expensive equipment. I'm asymptomatic, so the hardest part of having cancer &#8211; so far &#8211; is fighting the Kaiser bureaucracy to make sure my treatment goes off as planned: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/05/carcinoma-angels/#squeaky-nail The fact that the different Kaiser departments drop so many balls when handing off care between them means that I have to juggle those balls for them. I make extensive use of organizational tactics like "suspense files," which are a kind of inverted to-do list, in that they let you manage other people's to-do lists, rather than your own: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo (In case you're wondering, the best part of having cancer is that Kaiser comps 100% of your parking! Free cancer parking!) Now, I also make sure to note each of Kaiser's failures and I raise grievances and California health ombudsman complaints for each one &#8211; not because I'm angry and want an apology, but because I'm a well-organized, native English-speaking cancer patient with no symptoms, which means that I can do the advocacy that other people can't, and help them (I also track these complaints with suspense files, calendar entries, etc, to make sure that they're followed through). Partly, I'm able to do this because I'm very organized. I'm not organized because I worship at the cult of "personal productivity"; I'm definitely Jenny Odell-pilled on that score: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/ I'm organized because I pursue The Way of Jim Munroe's "Time Management for Anarchists" ("once I learned how to make my own structure, I was able to kick my expensive boss habit and work on my own"): https://jimmunroe.net/comics/pamphlets/time_management_for_anarchists/time_management_for_anarchists.html Having invested a lot of energy into being organized, I now get massive discounts on dealing with other people's shit. Remember: giant corporations and other remorseless bureaucracies throw up roadblocks on the assumption that you will be a "rational economic actor." The airline assumes that if it costs you 15 hours to collect on the $50 voucher you're entitled to, you will just let them steal $50 from you. But once you get organized enough, you can cut that 15-hour investment down to a 15-minute one, and I will absolutely trade 15 minutes of dealing with an airline's bullshit for $50 of that airline's money. (Why yes, Air Canada did fuck me over on Jan 3 and get me home at 5AM the next day, instead of 730PM the night before; and yes, they did deny my compensation claim; and yes, I have filed an appeal with the Canada Transport Agency; why do you ask?) One of my favorite podcasts is "An Arm and a Leg," which divides itself between deep dive structural analyses into how corrupt and ghastly American medical billing is, and enumerations of sweet hacks that ninja bill-fighters have come up with to slice through the billing labyrinth your insurer and hospital trap you in and cut straight to the bullseye: https://armandalegshow.com/ For example, the latest episode tells the story of Jared Walker, who figured out that hospitals were stealing billions of dollars every year from the poorest people in America, who were all entitled to have their medical bill canceled. He founded Dollarfor, a nonprofit that helps patients get their medical debt canceled: https://armandalegshow.com/episode/our-favorite-project-of-2025-levels-up-and-you-can-help/ Dollarfor now has an automated tool that guides you through a survey and then generates and files the completed, hospital-specific paperwork needed to get your medical debt canceled (they've made versions of this for every hospital in America!): https://dollarfor.org/ (If you're a health worker, here's a printable guide with QR codes that you can clip to your lanyard and show to patients while you deliver care): https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cfwK66A_mfBBBqn35_Lp7930uoY-73f/view Now, the real problem here isn't that hospitals steal billions from charity cases: it's that America has a garbage for-profit healthcare system that kills and bankrupts people at scale. Dollarfor is amazing, but it's not going to fix that problem. I don't know Walker, but I bet if you asked him, he'd agree with this, and say something like, "Yes, and I'm helping people not have their lives destroyed by this garbage system, which is good unto itself; and also, it might give them the free time and wherewithal to participate in movements to overthrow the garbage system." I really dote on the fact that Dollarfor has literally built a different version of their tool for every single hospital in the country. It's a perfect example of how turning yourself into a highly organized adversary can overcome the time-based economics our enemies rely on to keep their garbage systems intact. Whenever I think of this stuff, I flash on two pop-culture references that made a deep impression on me. The first comes from 1985's Real Genius, Val Kilmer's best ever movie (fight me!). Real Genius is set at a fictionalized version of Caltech in which young prodigies slowly discover that their scumbag prof has tricked them into working on a weapons contract for the DoD. This being fictional-Caltech, there are all these scenes in which very smart people do weird and amazing things. At one point, we learn that there's a former child prodigy living in the basement under the dorms, a guy named Lazlo Hollyfeld who became a hermit after discovering that he, too, had been duped into working on a baby-killer project. We get these tantalizing glimpses of Lazlo in his subterranean redoubt, where he has built some kind of giant Rube Goldberg machine that is engaged in a mysterious mechanical process that involves manipulating cards of some sort. At the film's denouement (spoiler alert for a 40 year old movie), we discover what he was doing: Lazlo: These are entries into the Frito-Lay Sweepstakes. "No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want" &#8211; so I am. Chris: That's great! How many times? Lazlo: Well, this batch makes it one million six hundred and fifty thousand. I should win thirty-two point six percent of the prizes, including the car. Chris: That kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it? Lazlo: They set up the rules, and lately I've come to realize that I have certain materialistic needs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6kBfBXZBdc Then there's a scene from the otherwise tepid (fight me!) Batman Returns (1992) in which we encounter the Penguin in his subterranean redoubt, brandishing pages full of kompromat that have been laboriously taped together: The Penguin: What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham City? Maximillian 'Max' Shreck: If there were such documents &#8211; and that's not an admission &#8211; I would have seen to it they were shredded. The Penguin: Ah, good idea! [pulls out a sheaf of documents] The Penguin: A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/quotes/ Both Lazlo and the Penguin are defeating the time-based security assumptions of their adversaries. Frito Lay treats filling in 1.65m sweepstakes entries as the same thing as filling in infinity entries; Max Schrek treats the time needed to piece together shredded paper as infinite. Rounding a very large number up to infinity isn't entirely irrational, but once you get organized enough, you just might be able to find the time &#8211; or a system &#8211; to bring that very big number down to an entirely tractable value. Yes, this is a species of "careful shopping" but my point isn't to say that shopping carefully is useless &#8211; rather, that it's a drastic error to mistake this useful (and surprisingly satisfying) tactic for a strategy that will truly alter the system.

Latest books: You keep readin&#39; em, I&#39;ll keep writin&#39; &#39;em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I&#39;ll keep writin&#39; &#39;em. Colophon: All the rest. The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating ungovernability as a habit (permalink) I am on record as being skeptical of the notion that if you shop very carefully, you can make society better. &#34;Conscious consumption&#34; is not a tool for structural change, and any election that requires you to &#34;vote with your wallet&#34; is always won by the people with the thickest wallets (statistically speaking, that&#39;s not you): https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/13/consumption-choices/#marginal-benefits Now, that&#39;s not to say that boycotts are useless. But a boycott is a structured and organized campaign. The Montgomery bus boycott wasn&#39;t a matter of a bunch of people waking up one morning and saying, &#34;You know what, fuck it, I&#39;m gonna walk today&#34;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery\_bus\_boycott The Montgomery bus boycott was an organized project, put together by a powerful membership organization, the NAACP, that demanded far more of its members than merely shopping very carefully. The boycott was the end stage of an organized resistance, not a substitute for it. The problem with &#34;conscious consumption&#34; is that it comes out of the neoliberal tradition in which every political matter is supposedly determined by your individual actions, and not your actions as part of a union or other political institution that works as a bloc to overthrow the status quo. &#34;Conscious consumption&#34; arises out of the tradition that gave us Margaret Thatcher&#39;s maxim, &#34;There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.&#34; Any attempt to change society by shopping very carefully is destined to fail, but it&#39;s worse than that. Because &#34;shopping very carefully&#34; never makes systemic change, its practitioners inevitably decide the reason they&#39;re not seeing the change they yearn for is that their allies aren&#39;t shopping carefully enough. This turns the careful shopper into a cop who polices other people&#39;s consumption, demanding that they stop eating some foodstuff or using Twitter or watching HBO Max. Squabbling over whether using a social media network makes you a Nazi generates far more heat than light – so much heat that it incinerates the solidarity you need to actually fight Nazis. Which is not an argument against boycotts! Boycotts work. If boycotts didn&#39;t work, then genocide apologists wouldn&#39;t be apoplectic over the BDS movement: https://bdsmovement.net/ But a &#34;boycott&#34; isn&#39;t the same thing as &#34;you and your social circle deciding that buying the wrong product makes you a Bad Person and then devoting your energies to scolding your allies for choosing Coke instead of Pepsi.&#34; Boycotts are downstream of organizing; they are not a substitute for organizing. There is such a thing as society. Now, all that said, I will confess: I sometimes do something that looks a lot like &#34;shopping very carefully,&#34; and when I do, I derive enormous satisfaction from it (but I am always careful not to mistake my tiny victories for political action). But I get it, honestly, I do. Sometimes, &#34;shopping very carefully&#34; is a way to eke out a tiny, personal victory in the face of overwhelming odds against a wildly overmatched opponent. That feels very good. One example would be patronizing my local repair shop (or fixing my stuff myself). The big structural barriers to repair are things like &#34;parts pairing&#34;: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification And manufacturers who abuse trademark law to get CBP to seize refurbished parts at the border: https://www.shacknews.com/article/108049/apple-repair-critic-louis-rossmann-takes-on-us-customs-counterfeit-battery-seizure The repair problem isn&#39;t that your neighbors are &#34;sheeple&#34; who&#39;ve had their minds warped by a &#34;throwaway society.&#34; The problem is that technical and legal countermeasures have made repair so hard and unprofitable that getting your stuff fixed is more expensive and time-consuming than it needs to be. That said: I love going to my local repair shop. I love fixing things on my own. It&#39;s great. It makes me feel great. I think you should do it because it may make you feel great, too, and it&#39;d be nice for you to support your local fix-it place, but let&#39;s not pretend that we&#39;ll change society that way. Here&#39;s another example: for the past couple years, I&#39;ve been navigating a (thankfully very treatable) cancer diagnosis. The fact that my cancer is very treatable doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easily treated. America&#39;s shitty, for-profit healthcare system is terrible at the best of times, and nearly unnavigable when coping with a complex condition that crosses a lot of disciplinary lines and requires access to specialized, expensive equipment. I&#39;m asymptomatic, so the hardest part of having cancer – so far – is fighting the Kaiser bureaucracy to make sure my treatment goes off as planned: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/05/carcinoma-angels/#squeaky-nail The fact that the different Kaiser departments drop so many balls when handing off care between them means that I have to juggle those balls for them. I make extensive use of organizational tactics like &#34;suspense files,&#34; which are a kind of inverted to-do list, in that they let you manage other people&#39;s to-do lists, rather than your own: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo (In case you&#39;re wondering, the best part of having cancer is that Kaiser comps 100% of your parking! Free cancer parking!) Now, I also make sure to note each of Kaiser&#39;s failures and I raise grievances and California health ombudsman complaints for each one – not because I&#39;m angry and want an apology, but because I&#39;m a well-organized, native English-speaking cancer patient with no symptoms, which means that I can do the advocacy that other people can&#39;t, and help them (I also track these complaints with suspense files, calendar entries, etc, to make sure that they&#39;re followed through). Partly, I&#39;m able to do this because I&#39;m very organized. I&#39;m not organized because I worship at the cult of &#34;personal productivity&#34;; I&#39;m definitely Jenny Odell-pilled on that score: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/ I&#39;m organized because I pursue The Way of Jim Munroe&#39;s &#34;Time Management for Anarchists&#34; (&#34;once I learned how to make my own structure, I was able to kick my expensive boss habit and work on my own&#34;): https://jimmunroe.net/comics/pamphlets/time\_management\_for\_anarchists/time\_management\_for\_anarchists.html Having invested a lot of energy into being organized, I now get massive discounts on dealing with other people&#39;s shit. Remember: giant corporations and other remorseless bureaucracies throw up roadblocks on the assumption that you will be a &#34;rational economic actor.&#34; The airline assumes that if it costs you 15 hours to collect on the $50 voucher you&#39;re entitled to, you will just let them steal $50 from you. But once you get organized enough, you can cut that 15-hour investment down to a 15-minute one, and I will absolutely trade 15 minutes of dealing with an airline&#39;s bullshit for $50 of that airline&#39;s money. (Why yes, Air Canada did fuck me over on Jan 3 and get me home at 5AM the next day, instead of 730PM the night before; and yes, they did deny my compensation claim; and yes, I have filed an appeal with the Canada Transport Agency; why do you ask?) One of my favorite podcasts is &#34;An Arm and a Leg,&#34; which divides itself between deep dive structural analyses into how corrupt and ghastly American medical billing is, and enumerations of sweet hacks that ninja bill-fighters have come up with to slice through the billing labyrinth your insurer and hospital trap you in and cut straight to the bullseye: https://armandalegshow.com/ For example, the latest episode tells the story of Jared Walker, who figured out that hospitals were stealing billions of dollars every year from the poorest people in America, who were all entitled to have their medical bill canceled. He founded Dollarfor, a nonprofit that helps patients get their medical debt canceled: https://armandalegshow.com/episode/our-favorite-project-of-2025-levels-up-and-you-can-help/ Dollarfor now has an automated tool that guides you through a survey and then generates and files the completed, hospital-specific paperwork needed to get your medical debt canceled (they&#39;ve made versions of this for every hospital in America!): https://dollarfor.org/ (If you&#39;re a health worker, here&#39;s a printable guide with QR codes that you can clip to your lanyard and show to patients while you deliver care): https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cfwK66A\_mfBBBqn35\_Lp7930uoY-73f/view Now, the real problem here isn&#39;t that hospitals steal billions from charity cases: it&#39;s that America has a garbage for-profit healthcare system that kills and bankrupts people at scale. Dollarfor is amazing, but it&#39;s not going to fix that problem. I don&#39;t know Walker, but I bet if you asked him, he&#39;d agree with this, and say something like, &#34;Yes, and I&#39;m helping people not have their lives destroyed by this garbage system, which is good unto itself; and also, it might give them the free time and wherewithal to participate in movements to overthrow the garbage system.&#34; I really dote on the fact that Dollarfor has literally built a different version of their tool for every single hospital in the country. It&#39;s a perfect example of how turning yourself into a highly organized adversary can overcome the time-based economics our enemies rely on to keep their garbage systems intact. Whenever I think of this stuff, I flash on two pop-culture references that made a deep impression on me. The first comes from 1985&#39;s Real Genius, Val Kilmer&#39;s best ever movie (fight me!).

Chris: That&#39;s great! How many times? Lazlo: Well, this batch makes it one million six hundred and fifty thousand. I should win thirty-two point six percent of the prizes, including the car. Chris: That kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn&#39;t it? Lazlo: They set up the rules, and lately I&#39;ve come to realize that I have certain materialistic needs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6kBfBXZBdc Then there&#39;s a scene from the otherwise tepid (fight me!) Batman Returns (1992) in which we encounter the Penguin in his subterranean redoubt, brandishing pages full of kompromat that have been laboriously taped together: The Penguin: What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham City? Maximillian &#39;Max&#39; Shreck: If there were such documents – and that&#39;s not an admission – I would have seen to it they were shredded.

Trained on over 5 million hours of speech data spanning 10 languages, Qwen3-TTS adopts a dual-track LM architecture for real-time synthesis [...]. Extensive experiments indicate state-of-the-art performance across diverse objective and subjective benchmark (e.g., TTS multilingual test set, InstructTTSEval, and our long speech test set).

      <source:markdown>**[Qwen3-TTS Family is Now Open Sourced: Voice Design, Clone, and Generation](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3tts-0115)**

I haven&#39;t been paying much attention to the state-of-the-art in speech generation models other than noting that they&#39;ve got _really good_, so I can&#39;t speak for how notable this new release from Qwen is.

From [the accompanying paper](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/assets/Qwen3_TTS.pdf):

&#62; In this report, we present the Qwen3-TTS series, a family of advanced multilingual, controllable, robust, and streaming text-to-speech models. Qwen3-TTS supports state-of- the-art 3-second voice cloning and description-based control, allowing both the creation of entirely novel voices and fine-grained manipulation over the output speech. Trained on over 5 million hours of speech data spanning 10 languages, Qwen3-TTS adopts a dual-track LM architecture for real-time synthesis \[...\]. Extensive experiments indicate state-of-the-art performance across diverse objective and subjective benchmark (e.g., TTS multilingual test set, InstructTTSEval, and our long speech test set). To facilitate community research and development, we release both tokenizers and models under the Apache 2.0 license.

To give an idea of size, [Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base) is 4.54GB on Hugging Face and [Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base) is 2.52GB.

The [Hugging Face demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS) lets you try out the 0.6B and 1.7B models for free in your browser, including voice cloning:

I tried this out by recording myself reading [my about page](https://simonwillison.net/about/) and then having Qwen3-TTS generate audio of me reading the Qwen3-TTS announcement post. Here&#39;s the result:

Your browser does not support the audio element.

It&#39;s important that everyone understands that voice cloning is now something that&#39;s available to anyone with a GPU and a few GBs of VRAM... or in this case a web browser that can access Hugging Face.

**Update**: Prince Canuma [got this working](https://x.com/Prince_Canuma/status/2014453857019904423) with his [mlx-audio](https://pypi.org/project/mlx-audio/) library. I [had Claude](https://claude.ai/share/2e01ad60-ca38-4e14-ab60-74eaa45b2fbd) turn that into [a CLI tool](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/q3_tts.py) which you can run with `uv` ike this:

```

  &#39;I am a pirate, give me your gold!&#39; \
  -i &#39;gruff voice&#39; -o pirate.wav

```

The `-i` option lets you use a prompt to describe the voice it should use. On first run this downloads a 4.5GB model file from Hugging Face.

        <![CDATA[<h3><em>For January 14-20, 2026</em></h3>

Hello and welcome to **A Newsletter of Humorous Writing**, a roundup of the week&#39;s finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Earlier this week, there was a chance for North Americans to get [a peek at the Northern Lights.](https://www.space.com/stargazing/auroras/northern-lights-may-be-visible-in-10-states-tonight-as-earths-magnetic-field-rings-like-a-bell-after-cme-impact?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427) If you were able to spot them, let us know: we paid for some night sky writing to promote the Newsletter, and want to ask for a refund if any of it got upstaged by the aurora.

And a reminder: If you have any feedback on the Newsletter, we’re all ears! Just reply to this email with any thoughts, suggestions, ideas, etc.! We’d love to hear from you.

## What We Enjoyed This Week

[**I Am the Person Who Controls Your Appliances**](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/shouts-murmurs/i-am-the-person-who-controls-your-appliances?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427) **by** [**Broti Gupta**](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/broti-gupta?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-427) _(The New Yorker)_ Always exciting to see a writer you like publishing again, and we were especially excited to see Broti’s byline. This is a classic short humor premise: a weird guy you didn’t know existed tells you their deal. Broti locks into a fun, laid back voice for this character, and the piece is full of great specifics.

We especially like the small detail in the title that these are the creatures that liked you—the added layer that all of these swimmers want to date the reader is very fun.

Late last year Richard Weiss [found something interesting](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vpNG99GhbBoLov9og/claude-4-5-opus-soul-document) while poking around with the just-released Claude Opus 4.5: he was able to talk the model into regurgitating a document which was _not_ part of the system prompt but appeared instead to be baked in during training, and which described Claude&#39;s core values at great length.

He called this leak the **soul document**, and Amanda Askell from Anthropic [quickly confirmed](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/2/claude-soul-document/) that it was indeed part of Claude&#39;s training procedures.

Today Anthropic made this official, [releasing that full &#34;constitution&#34; document](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution) under a CC0 (effectively public domain) license. There&#39;s a lot to absorb! It&#39;s over 35,000 tokens, more than 10x the length of the [published Opus 4.5 system prompt](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-opus-4-5).

One detail that caught my eye is the acknowledgements at the end, which include a list of [external contributors](https://www.anthropic.com/constitution#acknowledgements) who helped review the document. I was intrigued to note that two of the fifteen listed names are Catholic members of the clergy - [Father Brendan McGuire](https://www.frbrendanmcguire.org/biography) is a pastor in Los Altos with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Math and [Bishop Paul Tighe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tighe) is an Irish Catholic bishop with a background in moral theology.

        <p>Hello family and friends outside of Minnesota,</p>
        
        <p>Many of you have reached out to see how we are doing and Pete and I both thank you for that. We appreciate it. As middle-class White people, Pete and I are largely ok. Technically, speaking. And I cannot believe that is a sentence I just typed in the year 2026. But here we are. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet. For now. We are doing what we can to support those that we can. We are speaking out and calling our representatives. So far 20,000 people in this state have taken conscientious bystander training. As actors, Pete and I have created/rehearsed monologues or responses if we find ourselves witnessing the illegal doings of these “agents”. The people here are subdued, but not hopeless. Defiant, but not violent. We are doing our best to protest peacefully as this is what our constitution allows.</p>
        
        <p>Why do I write to you of these things?</p>
        
        <p>For a few reasons: 
        1. Depending on what media you are seeing you may be getting no coverage on this or varying degrees of truth to outright propaganda. I thought it best you hear it from someone who is actually living in MN right now. 
        2. No matter where you fall on the political spectrum I believe we can all agree that we have rights in this country: free speech, the right to peacefully protest, the right to due process to name a few. 
        3. Any support we can get, even if it is simply trying to combat disinformation with truth, from within our country or around the world is helpful and important. 
        4. If you wish to do other things, this is a good website which compiles many places/groups that are trying to help combat this situation. <a href="https://www.standwithminnesota.com/">https://www.standwithminnesota.com/</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Now to some things that are happening here:</p>
        
        <p>In addition to Jonathon Ross murdering Renee Good, the very same day they went to a high school and attempted to arrest students and staff. One day after this, 6 men with guns kicked in the door of someone’s home <strong>without a legal warrant</strong> and dragged the husband out in cuffs. He is an American citizen. Today local law enforcement in and around the Twin Cities held a press conference calling out these “agents” in breaking the law. They are now targeting and attempting to detain off-duty officers. Every single one of the officers they targeted are people of color. It is straight up racial profiling. They are smashing car windows and tear-gassing people including toddlers. <em>People are carrying their passports and birth certificates around with them</em> and often they are not even allowed to show these “agents” their paperwork before they are beaten and/or abducted.</p>
        
        <p>I have a dear friend who passed her citizenship test 6 years ago and is now carrying her documentation with her wherever she goes. She did everything “the right way” yet she is worried. Frankly, because she doesn’t look Hispanic or African she will probably be ok. Again, I can’t believe I just typed this sentence. Our nephew’s elementary school (in a very affluent, predominantly White suburb) canceled their school’s International Night for fear it would draw Immigrant Enforcement to the school. Pete and I are witnessing field trips to the Science Museum cancel left and right because schools are afraid they will target the children.</p>
        
        <p>These people  are not targeting the “worst of the worst” as they claimed they would do. They are not following the law or allowing due process. Minnesota is under siege. They are now telling observers who are giving witness and recording these crimes that “they should learn a lesson or they will be next.” Currently, these “agents” outnumber our local law enforcement 4 to 1. Donald Trump and Noem have particularly targeted Minnesota even though our state falls far behind other states in the amount of undocumented workers. Everyone is on edge. No one is untouched by this chaos.</p>
        
        <p>I don’t know what is going to happen. I don’t know what has happened to empathy and humanity. I do know that I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for my ancestors who immigrated here from Sweden, England, Ireland, and the Netherlands. But they did. So for their legacy and for the little kids who deserve to live without fear I will continue to show up and help where I can.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and feel free to share this with those who may be curious to what is actually happening in Minnesota.</p>
        
        <p>Love to all of you. Take care of each other.<br />

      <source:markdown>Our family in Minnesota knows we worry about them, and so yesterday they sent a family-wide email.

This is surely one of many thousands like it. Maybe you’ve written one of these. Maybe you will write one of these.

### Update from MN

Hello family and friends outside of Minnesota,

Many of you have reached out to see how we are doing and Pete and I both thank you for that. We appreciate it. As middle-class White people, Pete and I are largely ok. Technically, speaking. And I cannot believe that is a sentence I just typed in the year 2026. But here we are. Our neighborhood is relatively quiet. For now. We are doing what we can to support those that we can. We are speaking out and calling our representatives. So far 20,000 people in this state have taken conscientious bystander training. As actors, Pete and I have created/rehearsed monologues or responses if we find ourselves witnessing the illegal doings of these “agents”. The people here are subdued, but not hopeless. Defiant, but not violent. We are doing our best to protest peacefully as this is what our constitution allows.

Why do I write to you of these things?

For a few reasons:
1\. Depending on what media you are seeing you may be getting no coverage on this or varying degrees of truth to outright propaganda. I thought it best you hear it from someone who is actually living in MN right now.
2\. No matter where you fall on the political spectrum I believe we can all agree that we have rights in this country: free speech, the right to peacefully protest, the right to due process to name a few.
3\. Any support we can get, even if it is simply trying to combat disinformation with truth, from within our country or around the world is helpful and important.
4\. If you wish to do other things, this is a good website which compiles many places/groups that are trying to help combat this situation. [https://www.standwithminnesota.com/](https://www.standwithminnesota.com/).

Now to some things that are happening here:

In addition to Jonathon Ross murdering Renee Good, the very same day they went to a high school and attempted to arrest students and staff. One day after this, 6 men with guns kicked in the door of someone’s home **without a legal warrant** and dragged the husband out in cuffs. He is an American citizen. Today local law enforcement in and around the Twin Cities held a press conference calling out these “agents” in breaking the law. They are now targeting and attempting to detain off-duty officers. Every single one of the officers they targeted are people of color. It is straight up racial profiling. They are smashing car windows and tear-gassing people including toddlers. _People are carrying their passports and birth certificates around with them_ and often they are not even allowed to show these “agents” their paperwork before they are beaten and/or abducted.

I have a dear friend who passed her citizenship test 6 years ago and is now carrying her documentation with her wherever she goes. She did everything “the right way” yet she is worried. Frankly, because she doesn’t look Hispanic or African she will probably be ok. Again, I can’t believe I just typed this sentence. Our nephew’s elementary school (in a very affluent, predominantly White suburb) canceled their school’s International Night for fear it would draw Immigrant Enforcement to the school. Pete and I are witnessing field trips to the Science Museum cancel left and right because schools are afraid they will target the children.

These people are not targeting the “worst of the worst” as they claimed they would do. They are not following the law or allowing due process. Minnesota is under siege. They are now telling observers who are giving witness and recording these crimes that “they should learn a lesson or they will be next.” Currently, these “agents” outnumber our local law enforcement 4 to 1. Donald Trump and Noem have particularly targeted Minnesota even though our state falls far behind other states in the amount of undocumented workers. Everyone is on edge. No one is untouched by this chaos.

I don’t know what is going to happen. I don’t know what has happened to empathy and humanity. I do know that I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for my ancestors who immigrated here from Sweden, England, Ireland, and the Netherlands. But they did. So for their legacy and for the little kids who deserve to live without fear I will continue to show up and help where I can.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and feel free to share this with those who may be curious to what is actually happening in Minnesota.

Love to all of you. Take care of each other.

In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go4o6jiy8qE">first ad</a> two college age people, brother and sister it turns out, are on a cross-country drive and have a great trip planned. You can tell they love each other, and have a casual familiarity and trust and laugh a lot, teasing, as the itinerary scrolls by too fast to read more than two or three lines, but you can see they're going to have a better trip than I've ever had and I've done a lot of cross-country trips with friends over the years. </p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To04SSylvVY">other ad</a>, again with the young college-age people, this time a date, probably not the first date, at his apartment, and the guy is making dinner for his guest, and again, the plan scrolls by. He's making something nice, but not too much, and like the last ad, they're confident, young, full of life, and since they've used ChatGPT for just this purpose, they're probably going to have a great meal, and they'll go out again, for sure. </p>
        <p>This is the perfect advertising for this stage of their business. They are the leading product, the Coca Cola of AI systems, so they don't need to compare themselves with anyone, they are the standard -- and now they take the opportunity to define it. It's about friendship, love, looking good, getting the girl, etc. But it's wholesome and American. I bet they run the same ad in Denmark, only the kids speak Danish and have blonde hair and they go to places in Denmark and eat simple but good Danish food. </p>
        <p>I don't think Google or Facebook did these kinds of ads as they were rising to dominance. Apple did, Microsoft didn't. This will also change the press coverage they get. Journalists like to pretend that ads don't infulence what they think, but good ones like these do. </p>
        <p>BTW, if Microsoft had done ads introducing themselves to the world as the future tech behemoth, they might have gone folksy -- like Smucker's jam. "With a name like Microsoft, it has to be good." You probably don't even think about it these days the name is so familiar, but MIcro + Soft is not the most inspiring name for a tech product. But then ChatGPT is a pretty awful name too. Four syllables, too many. Three is ideal. Imho ymmv. Doesn't matter now, everyone has learned to say it. And they need those ads to cement the bond with the people of the world. </p>]]>

      <title>Pluralistic: Google&#39;s AI pricing plan (21 Jan 2026)</title>
      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/21/cod-marxism/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links Google's AI pricing plan: From each according to their ability (to pay). Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Disney buys Pixar; Bruces on "vernacular video"; Hickey paralysis; RIP David Hartwell; Personalized pricing; They were warned. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Google's AI pricing plan (permalink) Google is spending a lot on AI, but what's not clear is how Google will make a lot from AI. Or, you know, even break even. Given, you know, that businesses are seeing zero return from AI: https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/pwc_ai_ceo_survey/ But maybe they've figured it out. In a recent edition of his BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller pulls on several of the strings that Google's top execs have dangled recently: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/will-google-organize-the-worlds-prices The first string: Google's going to spy on you a lot more, for the same reason Microsoft is spying on all of its users: because they want to supply their AI "agents" with your personal data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4 Google's announced that it's going to feed its AI your Gmail messages, as well as the whole deep surveillance dossier the company has assembled based on your use of all the company's products: Youtube, Maps, Photos, and, of course, Search: https://twitter.com/Google/status/2011473059547390106 The second piece of news is that Apple has partnered with Google to supply Gemini to all iPhone users: https://twitter.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017 Apple already charges Google more than $20b/year not to enter the search market; now they're going to be charging Google billions to stay out of the AI market, too. Meanwhile, Google will get to spy on Apple customers, just like they spy on their own users. Anyone who says that Apple is ideologically committed to your privacy because they're real capitalists is a sucker (or a cultist): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones But the big revelation is how Google is going to make money with AI: they're going to sell AI-based "personalized pricing" to "partners," including "Walmart, Visa, Mastercard, Shopify, Gap, Kroger, Macy’s, Stripe, Home Depot, Lowe's, American Express, etc": https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/ Personalized pricing, of course, is the polite euphemism for surveillance pricing, which is when a company spies on you in order to figure out how much they can get away with charging you (or how little they can get away with paying you): https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/# It's a weird form of cod-Marxism, whose tenet is "From each according to their desperation; to each according to their vulnerability." Surveillance pricing advocates say that this is "efficient" because they can use surveillance data to offer you discounts, too &#8211; like, say you rock up to an airline ticket counter 45 minutes before takeoff and they can use surveillance data to know that you won't take their last empty seat for $200, but you would fly in it for $100, you could get that seat for cheap. This is, of course, nonsense. Airlines don't sell off cheap seats like bakeries discounting their day-olds &#8211; they jack up the price of a last-minute journey to farcical heights. Google also claims that it will only use its surveillance pricing facility to offer discounts, and not to extract premiums. As Stoller points out, there's a well-developed playbook for making premiums look like discounts, which is easy to see in the health industry. As Stoller says, the list price for an MRI is $8,000, but your insurer gets a $6000 "discount" and actually pays $1970, sticking you with a $30 co-pay. The $8000 is a fake number, and so is the $6000 &#8211; the only real price is the $30 you're paying. The whole economy is filled with versions of this transparent ruse, from "department stores who routinely mark everything as 80% off" to pharmacy benefit managers: https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/23/shield-of-boringness/#some-men-rob-you-with-a-fountain-pen Google, meanwhile, is touting its new "universal commerce protocol" (UCP), a way for AI "agents" to retrieve prices and product descriptions and make purchases: https://www.thesling.org/the-harm-to-consumers-and-sellers-from-universal-commerce-protocol-in-googles-own-words/ Right now, a major hurdle to "agentic AI" is the complexity of navigating websites designed for humans. AI agents just aren't very reliable when it comes to figuring out which product is which, choosing the correct options, and putting it in a shopping cart, and then paying for it. Some of that is merely because websites have inconsistent "semantics" &#8211; literally things like the "buy" button being called something other than "buy button" in the HTML code. But there's a far more profound problem with agentic shopping, which is that companies deliberately obfuscate their prices. This is how junk fees work, and why they're so destructive. Say you're a hotel providing your rate-card to an online travel website. You know that travelers are going to search for hotels by city and amenities, and then sort the resulting list by price. If you hide your final price &#8211; by surprising the user with a bunch of junk fees at checkout, or, better yet, after they arrive and put their credit-card down at reception &#8211; you are going to be at the top of that list. Your hotel will seem like the cheapest, best option. But of course, it's not. From Ticketmaster to car rentals, hotels to discount airlines, rental apartments to cellular plans, the real price is withheld until the very last instant, whereupon it shoots up to levels that are absolutely uncompetitive. But because these companies are able to engage in deceptive advertising, they look cheaper. And of course, crooked offers drive out honest ones. The honest hotel that provides a true rate card, reflecting the all-in price, ends up at the bottom of the price-sorted list, rents no rooms, and goes out of business (or pivots to lying about its prices, too). Online sellers do not want to expose their true prices to comparison shopping services. They benefit from lying to those services. For decades, technologists have dreamed of building a "semantic web" in which everyone exposes true and accurate machine-readable manifests of their content to facilitate indexing, search and data-mining: https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm This has failed. It's failed because lying is often more profitable than telling the truth, and because lying to computers is easier than lying to people, and because once a market is dominated by liars, everyone has to lie, or be pushed out of the market. Of course, it would be really cool if everyone diligently marked up everything they put into the public sphere with accurate metadata. But there are lots of really cool things you could do if you could get everyone else to change how they do things and arrange their affairs to your convenience. Imagine how great it would be if you could just get everyone to board an airplane from back to front, or to stand right and walk left on escalators, or to put on headphones when using their phones in public. Wanting it badly is not enough. People have lots of reasons for doing things in suboptimal ways. Often the reason is that it's suboptimal for you, but just peachy for them. Google says that it's going to get every website in the world to expose accurate rate cards to its chatbots to facilitate agentic AI. Google is also incapable of preventing "search engine optimization" companies from tricking it into showing bullshit at the top of the results for common queries: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/03/keyword-swarming/#site-reputation-abuse Google somehow thinks that the companies that spend millions of dollars trying to trick its crawler won't also spend millions of dollars trying to trick its chatbot &#8211; and they're providing the internet with a tool to inject lies straight into the chatbot's input hopper. But UCP isn't just a way for companies to tell Google what their prices are. As Stoller points out, UCP will also sell merchants the ability to have Gemini set prices on their products, using Google's surveillance data, through "dynamic pricing" (another euphemism for "surveillance pricing"). This decade has seen the rise and rise of price "clearinghouses" &#8211; companies that offer price "consulting" to direct competitors in a market. Nominally, this is just a case of two competitors shopping with the same supplier &#8211; like Procter and Gamble and Unilever buying their high-fructose corn-syrup from the same company. But it's actually far more sinister. "Clearinghouses" like Realpage &#8211; a company that "advises" landlords on rental rates &#8211; allow all the major competitors in a market to collude to raise prices in lockstep. A Realpage landlord that ignores the service's "advice" and gives a tenant a break on the rent will be excluded from Realpage's service. The rental markets that Realpage dominates have seen major increases in rental rates: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/09/pricewars/#adam-smith-communist Google's "direct pricing" offering will allow all comers to have Google set their prices for them, based on Google's surveillance data. That includes direct competitors. As Stoller points out, both Nike and Reebok are Google advertisers. If they let Google price their sneakers, Google can raise prices across the market in lockstep. Despite how much everyone hates this garbage, neoclassical economists and their apologists in the legal profession continue to insist that surveillance pricing is "efficient." Stoller points to a law review article called "Antitrust After the Coming Wave," written by antitrust law prof and Google lawyer Daniel Crane: https://nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-99-number-4/antitrust-after-the-coming-wave/ Crane argues that AI will kill antitrust law because AI favors monopolies, and argues "that we should forget about promoting competition or costs, and instead enact a new Soviet-style regime, one in which the government would merely direct a monopolist’s 'AI to maximize social welfare and allocate the surplus created among different stakeholders of the firm.'" This is a planned economy, but it's one in which the planning is done by monopolists who are &#8211; somehow, implausibly &#8211; so biddable that governments can delegate the power to decide what we can buy and sell, what we can afford and who can afford it, and rein them in if they get it wrong. In 1890, Senator John Sherman was stumping for the Sherman Act, America's first antitrust law. On the Senate floor, he declared: If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity. https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/ Google thinks that it has finally found a profitable use for AI. It thinks that it will be the first company to make money on AI, by harnessing that AI to a market-rigging, price-gouging monopoly that turns Google's software into Sherman's "autocrat of trade." It's funny when you think of all those "AI safety" bros who claimed that AI's greatest danger was that it would become sentient and devour us. It turns out that the real "AI safety" risk is that AI will automate price gouging at scale, allowing Google to crown itself a "King over the necessaries of life": https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space (Image: Noah_Loverbear; CC BY-SA 3.0; Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; modified) Hey look at this (permalink) The Line, a Saudi Megaproject, Is Dead https://www.thenation.com/article/world/the-line-neom-saudi-vision-2030/ Mark Carney's full speech at the World Economic Forum https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqHDhO4h10 A Grassroots Victory in the Golden Age of Bullies https://asupposedlylonething.net/blog/2026/grassroots-victory-golden-age-bullies/ AI may be everywhere, but it's nowhere in recent productivity statistics https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/forrester_ai_jobs_impact/ The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight Against Forgetting https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting Object permanence (permalink) #20yrsago Disney swaps stock for Pixar; Jobs is largest Disney stockholder https://web.archive.org/web/20060129105430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/01/22/cnpixar22.xml&#38;amp;menuId=242&#38;amp;sSheet=/money/2006/01/22/ixcitytop.html #20yrsago HOWTO anonymize your search history https://web.archive.org/web/20060220004353/https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70051-0.html #15yrsago Bruce Sterling talk on “vernacular video” https://vimeo.com/18977827 #15yrsago Elaborate televised prank on Belgium’s terrible phone company https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXlDyTD7wo #15yrsago Portugal: 10 years of decriminalized drugs https://web.archive.org/web/20110120040831/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/16/drug_experiment/?page=full #15yrsago Woman paralyzed by hickey https://web.archive.org/web/20110123072349/https://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/01/21/new-zealand-woman-partially-paralyzed-hickey/ #15yrsago EFF warns: mobile OS vendors aren’t serious about security https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/dont-sacrifice-security-mobile-devices #10yrsago Trumpscript: a programming language based on the rhetorical tactics of Donald Trump https://www.inverse.com/article/10448-coders-assimilate-donald-trump-to-a-programming-language #10yrsago That time the DoD paid Duke U $335K to investigate ESP in dogs.

Colophon: All the rest. Google&#39;s AI pricing plan (permalink) Google is spending a lot on AI, but what&#39;s not clear is how Google will make a lot from AI. Or, you know, even break even. Given, you know, that businesses are seeing zero return from AI: https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/pwc\_ai\_ceo\_survey/ But maybe they&#39;ve figured it out. In a recent edition of his BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller pulls on several of the strings that Google&#39;s top execs have dangled recently: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/will-google-organize-the-worlds-prices The first string: Google&#39;s going to spy on you a lot more, for the same reason Microsoft is spying on all of its users: because they want to supply their AI &#34;agents&#34; with your personal data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4 Google&#39;s announced that it&#39;s going to feed its AI your Gmail messages, as well as the whole deep surveillance dossier the company has assembled based on your use of all the company&#39;s products: Youtube, Maps, Photos, and, of course, Search: https://twitter.com/Google/status/2011473059547390106 The second piece of news is that Apple has partnered with Google to supply Gemini to all iPhone users: https://twitter.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017 Apple already charges Google more than $20b/year not to enter the search market; now they&#39;re going to be charging Google billions to stay out of the AI market, too. Meanwhile, Google will get to spy on Apple customers, just like they spy on their own users. Anyone who says that Apple is ideologically committed to your privacy because they&#39;re real capitalists is a sucker (or a cultist): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones But the big revelation is how Google is going to make money with AI: they&#39;re going to sell AI-based &#34;personalized pricing&#34; to &#34;partners,&#34; including &#34;Walmart, Visa, Mastercard, Shopify, Gap, Kroger, Macy’s, Stripe, Home Depot, Lowe&#39;s, American Express, etc&#34;: https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/ Personalized pricing, of course, is the polite euphemism for surveillance pricing, which is when a company spies on you in order to figure out how much they can get away with charging you (or how little they can get away with paying you): https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/# It&#39;s a weird form of cod-Marxism, whose tenet is &#34;From each according to their desperation; to each according to their vulnerability.&#34; Surveillance pricing advocates say that this is &#34;efficient&#34; because they can use surveillance data to offer you discounts, too – like, say you rock up to an airline ticket counter 45 minutes before takeoff and they can use surveillance data to know that you won&#39;t take their last empty seat for $200, but you would fly in it for $100, you could get that seat for cheap. This is, of course, nonsense. Airlines don&#39;t sell off cheap seats like bakeries discounting their day-olds – they jack up the price of a last-minute journey to farcical heights. Google also claims that it will only use its surveillance pricing facility to offer discounts, and not to extract premiums. As Stoller points out, there&#39;s a well-developed playbook for making premiums look like discounts, which is easy to see in the health industry. As Stoller says, the list price for an MRI is $8,000, but your insurer gets a $6000 &#34;discount&#34; and actually pays $1970, sticking you with a $30 co-pay. The $8000 is a fake number, and so is the $6000 – the only real price is the $30 you&#39;re paying. The whole economy is filled with versions of this transparent ruse, from &#34;department stores who routinely mark everything as 80% off&#34; to pharmacy benefit managers: https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/23/shield-of-boringness/#some-men-rob-you-with-a-fountain-pen Google, meanwhile, is touting its new &#34;universal commerce protocol&#34; (UCP), a way for AI &#34;agents&#34; to retrieve prices and product descriptions and make purchases: https://www.thesling.org/the-harm-to-consumers-and-sellers-from-universal-commerce-protocol-in-googles-own-words/ Right now, a major hurdle to &#34;agentic AI&#34; is the complexity of navigating websites designed for humans. AI agents just aren&#39;t very reliable when it comes to figuring out which product is which, choosing the correct options, and putting it in a shopping cart, and then paying for it. Some of that is merely because websites have inconsistent &#34;semantics&#34; – literally things like the &#34;buy&#34; button being called something other than &#34;buy button&#34; in the HTML code. But there&#39;s a far more profound problem with agentic shopping, which is that companies deliberately obfuscate their prices. This is how junk fees work, and why they&#39;re so destructive. Say you&#39;re a hotel providing your rate-card to an online travel website. You know that travelers are going to search for hotels by city and amenities, and then sort the resulting list by price. If you hide your final price – by surprising the user with a bunch of junk fees at checkout, or, better yet, after they arrive and put their credit-card down at reception – you are going to be at the top of that list. Your hotel will seem like the cheapest, best option. But of course, it&#39;s not. From Ticketmaster to car rentals, hotels to discount airlines, rental apartments to cellular plans, the real price is withheld until the very last instant, whereupon it shoots up to levels that are absolutely uncompetitive. But because these companies are able to engage in deceptive advertising, they look cheaper. And of course, crooked offers drive out honest ones. The honest hotel that provides a true rate card, reflecting the all-in price, ends up at the bottom of the price-sorted list, rents no rooms, and goes out of business (or pivots to lying about its prices, too). Online sellers do not want to expose their true prices to comparison shopping services. They benefit from lying to those services. For decades, technologists have dreamed of building a &#34;semantic web&#34; in which everyone exposes true and accurate machine-readable manifests of their content to facilitate indexing, search and data-mining: https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm This has failed. It&#39;s failed because lying is often more profitable than telling the truth, and because lying to computers is easier than lying to people, and because once a market is dominated by liars, everyone has to lie, or be pushed out of the market. Of course, it would be really cool if everyone diligently marked up everything they put into the public sphere with accurate metadata. But there are lots of really cool things you could do if you could get everyone else to change how they do things and arrange their affairs to your convenience. Imagine how great it would be if you could just get everyone to board an airplane from back to front, or to stand right and walk left on escalators, or to put on headphones when using their phones in public. Wanting it badly is not enough. People have lots of reasons for doing things in suboptimal ways. Often the reason is that it&#39;s suboptimal for you, but just peachy for them. Google says that it&#39;s going to get every website in the world to expose accurate rate cards to its chatbots to facilitate agentic AI. Google is also incapable of preventing &#34;search engine optimization&#34; companies from tricking it into showing bullshit at the top of the results for common queries: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/03/keyword-swarming/#site-reputation-abuse Google somehow thinks that the companies that spend millions of dollars trying to trick its crawler won&#39;t also spend millions of dollars trying to trick its chatbot – and they&#39;re providing the internet with a tool to inject lies straight into the chatbot&#39;s input hopper. But UCP isn&#39;t just a way for companies to tell Google what their prices are. As Stoller points out, UCP will also sell merchants the ability to have Gemini set prices on their products, using Google&#39;s surveillance data, through &#34;dynamic pricing&#34; (another euphemism for &#34;surveillance pricing&#34;). This decade has seen the rise and rise of price &#34;clearinghouses&#34; – companies that offer price &#34;consulting&#34; to direct competitors in a market. Nominally, this is just a case of two competitors shopping with the same supplier – like Procter and Gamble and Unilever buying their high-fructose corn-syrup from the same company. But it&#39;s actually far more sinister. &#34;Clearinghouses&#34; like Realpage – a company that &#34;advises&#34; landlords on rental rates – allow all the major competitors in a market to collude to raise prices in lockstep. A Realpage landlord that ignores the service&#39;s &#34;advice&#34; and gives a tenant a break on the rent will be excluded from Realpage&#39;s service. The rental markets that Realpage dominates have seen major increases in rental rates: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/09/pricewars/#adam-smith-communist Google&#39;s &#34;direct pricing&#34; offering will allow all comers to have Google set their prices for them, based on Google&#39;s surveillance data. That includes direct competitors. As Stoller points out, both Nike and Reebok are Google advertisers. If they let Google price their sneakers, Google can raise prices across the market in lockstep. Despite how much everyone hates this garbage, neoclassical economists and their apologists in the legal profession continue to insist that surveillance pricing is &#34;efficient.&#34; Stoller points to a law review article called &#34;Antitrust After the Coming Wave,&#34; written by antitrust law prof and Google lawyer Daniel Crane: https://nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-99-number-4/antitrust-after-the-coming-wave/ Crane argues that AI will kill antitrust law because AI favors monopolies, and argues &#34;that we should forget about promoting competition or costs, and instead enact a new Soviet-style regime, one in which the government would merely direct a monopolist’s &#39;AI to maximize social welfare and allocate the surplus created among different stakeholders of the firm.&#39;&#34; This is a planned economy, but it&#39;s one in which the planning is done by monopolists who are – somehow, implausibly – so biddable that governments can delegate the power to decide what we can buy and sell, what we can afford and who can afford it, and rein them in if they get it wrong. In 1890, Senator John Sherman was stumping for the Sherman Act, America&#39;s first antitrust law. On the Senate floor, he declared: If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity. https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/ Google thinks that it has finally found a profitable use for AI. It thinks that it will be the first company to make money on AI, by harnessing that AI to a market-rigging, price-gouging monopoly that turns Google&#39;s software into Sherman&#39;s &#34;autocrat of trade.&#34; It&#39;s funny when you think of all those &#34;AI safety&#34; bros who claimed that AI&#39;s greatest danger was that it would become sentient and devour us. It turns out that the real &#34;AI safety&#34; risk is that AI will automate price gouging at scale, allowing Google to crown itself a &#34;King over the necessaries of life&#34;: https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space (Image: Noah\_Loverbear; CC BY-SA 3.0; Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; modified) Hey look at this (permalink) The Line, a Saudi Megaproject, Is Dead https://www.thenation.com/article/world/the-line-neom-saudi-vision-2030/ Mark Carney&#39;s full speech at the World Economic Forum https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqHDhO4h10 A Grassroots Victory in the Golden Age of Bullies https://asupposedlylonething.net/blog/2026/grassroots-victory-golden-age-bullies/ AI may be everywhere, but it&#39;s nowhere in recent productivity statistics https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/forrester\_ai\_jobs\_impact/ The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight Against Forgetting https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting Object permanence (permalink) #20yrsago Disney swaps stock for Pixar; Jobs is largest Disney stockholder https://web.archive.org/web/20060129105430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/01/22/cnpixar22.xml&#38;amp;menuId=242&#38;amp;sSheet=/money/2006/01/22/ixcitytop.html #20yrsago HOWTO anonymize your search history https://web.archive.org/web/20060220004353/https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70051-0.html #15yrsago Bruce Sterling talk on “vernacular video” https://vimeo.com/18977827 #15yrsago Elaborate televised prank on Belgium’s terrible phone company https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXlDyTD7wo #15yrsago Portugal: 10 years of decriminalized drugs https://web.archive.org/web/20110120040831/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/16/drug\_experiment/?page=full #15yrsago Woman paralyzed by hickey https://web.archive.org/web/20110123072349/https://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/01/21/new-zealand-woman-partially-paralyzed-hickey/ #15yrsago EFF warns: mobile OS vendors aren’t serious about security https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/dont-sacrifice-security-mobile-devices #10yrsago Trumpscript: a programming language based on the rhetorical tactics of Donald Trump https://www.inverse.com/article/10448-coders-assimilate-donald-trump-to-a-programming-language #10yrsago That time the DoD paid Duke U $335K to investigate ESP in dogs.

        <![CDATA[<p>Nobody wants to be told how to think. I think the best thing is to be friends with everyone you can. And maybe don't make a big issue about who people voted for, and relate as people and Americans. That's something to put in the bank.</p>
        <p>Also if you let people relax around you, you may find out that someone you trust and like is actually antisemitic or racist. That's also something to put in the bank, this is not someone I want to trust if and when things get worse.</p>
        <p>Things are changing radically now. so you may not have to do anything to wake anyone up. And it's good to reflect on your own attitudes and whether or not some of the things they say about you are fair criticism.

      <source:markdown>Nobody wants to be told how to think. I think the best thing is to be friends with everyone you can. And maybe don&#39;t make a big issue about who people voted for, and relate as people and Americans. That&#39;s something to put in the bank.

Also if you let people relax around you, you may find out that someone you trust and like is actually antisemitic or racist. That&#39;s also something to put in the bank, this is not someone I want to trust if and when things get worse.

Things are changing radically now. so you may not have to do anything to wake anyone up. And it&#39;s good to reflect on your own attitudes and whether or not some of the things they say about you are fair criticism. We all put up barriers, and those don&#39;t ever serve us imho, esp in a democracy -- but they are esp nasty now.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Last night I decided it was time to get [stutter](https://ino.is/stutter) working as a mobile app. I had built the browser add-on to work on mobile devices, but since that time all the mobile clients stopped allowing add-ons. My hope in Firefox is gone.

So, time to convert to mobile. That&#39;s fine. I have all the logic already. I don&#39;t know Android dev, but this is a good use of an LLM: translating things to new languages.

It took a couple hours but I&#39;ve got a MVP version working. I spent a few hours more last night and this morning refactoring to get it submitted to Fdroid. It&#39;s awaiting approval now.

Hopefully in a couple days you&#39;ll be able to search for and install Stutter! Then I can get to work improving... everything.</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[<p>I redesigned <a href="https://www.jim-nielsen.com" >my www website</a>. Why?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The end of year / holiday break is a great time to work on such things.</li>
        <li>I wanted to scratch an itch.</li>

        <li>Do I really need a reason? Nope.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I read something along the lines of “If you ship something that shows everything you’ve made, it’s dead on arrival.”</p>
        <p>Oooof. I feel that. It’s so hard to make a <em>personal</em> website that keeps up with your own <em>personal</em> evolution and change.</p>
        <p>But the hell if I’m not gonna try — and go through many existential crises in the process.</p>
        <p>I was chasing the idea of making my “home” page essentially a list of feeds, like:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Hey, <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com" >I blog</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>

        <li>Guess what? <a href="https://macosicongallery.com" >I collect macOS icons</a> too. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
        <li>Hey, I ___. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You get the idea.</p>
        <p>The thought was: if I condense the variety of the things I do online into a collection of feeds (hard-coded or live from other sites I publish), then I’ll never be out of date!</p>
        <p>Plus I love links. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/following-links/" >I love following them.</a> I wanted my home page to be the start of a journey, not the end. A jumping off point, not a terminal one.</p>
        <p>At least that was the idea behind this iteration.</p>
        <h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>I built the (static) site using <a href="https://weborigami.org" >Web Origami</a>.</p>

        <p>In just those few lines of code I:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Fetch a JSON feed over the network</li>
        <li>Grabbed the 3 most recent entries</li>
        <li>Turn the data into markup</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, here’s the code showing my latest blog posts:</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami-code-blog.png" width="661" height="566" alt="Screenshot of Web Origami code on the top and its output on the bottom (a list of blog post links)." data-og-image />
        
        </p><p>And here’s the code showing the latest icons in my iOS collection:</p>

        </p><p>Beautiful and succinct, isn’t it?</p>
        <p>Origami is a static site builder, so to keep my site “up to date” I just set Netlify to build my site every 24 hours which pulls data from a variety of sources, sticks it in a single HTML file, and publishes it as a website.</p>
        <p>The “build my site every 24 hours” isn’t quite as easy as you might think.

        <p>I went with something simpler — at least simpler to me. </p>

        <li>Setup <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/build/configure-builds/build-hooks/" >a build hook</a> on Netlify (which you have to do for the schedule function approach anyway).</li>
        <li>Use Apple’s Shortcuts app to create a shortcut that issues a POST request to my build hook.</li>
        <li>Use Shortcuts’ “Automation” feature to run that shortcut every day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So the “cron server” in my case is my iPhone, which works great because it’s basically always connected to the internet. If I go off grid for a few days and my website doesn’t refresh, I’m ok with that trade-off.</p>

      <source:markdown>I redesigned [my www website](https://www.jim-nielsen.com). Why?

- The end of year / holiday break is a great time to work on such things.
- I wanted to scratch an itch.
- Websites are [a worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/) \[ _gestures at current state of the world_\]
- Do I really need a reason? Nope.

I read something along the lines of “If you ship something that shows everything you’ve made, it’s dead on arrival.”

Oooof. I feel that. It’s so hard to make a _personal_ website that keeps up with your own _personal_ evolution and change.

But the hell if I’m not gonna try — and go through many existential crises in the process.

I was chasing the idea of making my “home” page essentially a list of feeds, like:

- Hey, [I blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com). Here’s the latest: \[1, 2, 3\]
- Yo, [I take notes](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com). Here’s the latest: \[1, 2, 3\]
- Bruh, [I collect iOS icons](https://iosicongallery.com). Here’s the latest: \[1, 2, 3\]
- Guess what? [I collect macOS icons](https://macosicongallery.com) too. Here’s the latest: \[1, 2, 3\]
- Hey, I \_\_\_. Here’s the latest: \[1, 2, 3\]

You get the idea.

The thought was: if I condense the variety of the things I do online into a collection of feeds (hard-coded or live from other sites I publish), then I’ll never be out of date!

Plus I love links. [I love following them.](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/following-links/) I wanted my home page to be the start of a journey, not the end. A jumping off point, not a terminal one.

At least that was the idea behind this iteration.

## Behind the Scenes

I built the (static) site using [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org).

I loved it! Origami is great for dealing with feeds because it makes fetching data from the network and templating it incredibly succinct.

```language html
&#60;h2&#62;Latest from my notes blog&#60;/h2&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
  ${Tree.map(
    (https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/feed.json).items.slice(0,3),
    (note) =&#62; `&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;${note.url}&#34;&#62;${note.title}&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;`
  )}
&#60;/ul&#62;

```

In just those few lines of code I:

- Fetch a JSON feed over the network
- Grabbed the 3 most recent entries
- Turn the data into markup

For example, here’s the code showing my latest blog posts:

![Screenshot of Web Origami code on the top and its output on the bottom (a list of blog post links).](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami-code-blog.png)

And here’s the code showing the latest icons in my iOS collection:

![Screenshot of Web Origami code on top and its output on the bottom (a grid of icons).](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami-code-ios.png)

Beautiful and succinct, isn’t it?

Origami is a static site builder, so to keep my site “up to date” I just set Netlify to build my site every 24 hours which pulls data from a variety of sources, sticks it in a single HTML file, and publishes it as a website.

The “build my site every 24 hours” isn’t quite as easy as you might think. You can use a [scheduled function on Netlify’s platform](https://docs.netlify.com/build/functions/scheduled-functions/) but that requires [writing code](https://tinloof.com/blog/how-to-build-cron-jobs-with-netlify-functions) (which also means maintaining and debugging said code). That seems to be [Netlify’s official answer to the question: “How do I schedule deploys?”](https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-schedule-deploys-with-netlify/)

I went with something simpler — at least simpler to me.

- Setup [a build hook](https://docs.netlify.com/build/configure-builds/build-hooks/) on Netlify (which you have to do for the schedule function approach anyway).
- Use Apple’s Shortcuts app to create a shortcut that issues a POST request to my build hook.
- Use Shortcuts’ “Automation” feature to run that shortcut every day.

So the “cron server” in my case is my iPhone, which works great because it’s basically always connected to the internet. If I go off grid for a few days and my website doesn’t refresh, I’m ok with that trade-off.

        Detailed and thoughtful description of an open-book and open-chatbot exam run by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Dricot">Ploum</a> at École Polytechnique de Louvain for an "Open Source Strategies" class.</p>
        <p>Students were told they could use chatbots during the exam but they had to announce their intention to do so in advance, share their prompts and take full accountability for any mistakes they made.</p>
        <p>Only 3 out of 60 students chose to use chatbots. Ploum surveyed half of the class to help understand their motivations.

      <source:markdown>**[Giving University Exams in the Age of Chatbots](https://ploum.net/2026-01-19-exam-with-chatbots.html)**

Detailed and thoughtful description of an open-book and open-chatbot exam run by [Ploum](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Dricot) at École Polytechnique de Louvain for an &#34;Open Source Strategies&#34; class.

Students were told they could use chatbots during the exam but they had to announce their intention to do so in advance, share their prompts and take full accountability for any mistakes they made.

Only 3 out of 60 students chose to use chatbots. Ploum surveyed half of the class to help understand their motivations.

        Bruce Li introduces his <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting"><i>The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight Against Forgetting</i></a> thus:<br />
        <blockquote>
        This report delves into the mechanics of the Internet Archive with the precision of a teardown. We will strip back the chassis to examine the custom-built PetaBox servers that heat the building without air conditioning. We will trace the evolution of the web crawlers—from the early tape-based dumps of Alexa Internet to the sophisticated browser-based bots of 2025. We will analyze the financial ledger of this non-profit giant, exploring how it survives on a budget that is a rounding error for its Silicon Valley neighbors. And finally, we will look to the future, where the "Decentralized Web" (DWeb) promises to fragment the Archive into a million pieces to ensure it can never be destroyed.
        </blockquote>
        It is long, detailed, comprehensive and well worth reading in full. Below the fold I comment on the part about storage.<br />

        The first custom-designed Internet Archive storage system was version 1 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetaBox">PetaBox</a>, a vividly red-painted 1U system introduced in 2004. This picture shows a rack of them. I'm familiar with them because the <a href="https://lockss.org">LOCKSS Program</a> used them for some years.<br />
        <br />
        They were great! Li <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">explains</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        The first PetaBox rack, operational in June 2004, was a revelation in storage density. It held 100 terabytes (TB) of data—a massive sum at the time—while consuming only about 6 kilowatts of power. To put that in perspective, in 2003, the entire Wayback Machine was growing at a rate of just 12 terabytes per month.
        </blockquote>
        The LOCKSS Program eventually <a href="http://www.lockss.org/locksswp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IDCC2013.pdf">transitioned to 4U systems</a> similar to those then in use at <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>. Around the same time the Archive also moved to 4U systems for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetaBox">PetaBox</a>.<br />

        As disk technology progressed the Archive continued <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">evolving the system</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        The fourth-generation PetaBox, introduced around 2010, exemplified this density. Each rack contained 240 disks of 2 terabytes each, organized into 4U high rack mounts. These units were powered by Intel Xeon processors (specifically the E7-8870 series in later upgrades) with 12 gigabytes of RAM. The architecture relied on bonding pair of 1-gigabit interfaces to create a 2-gigabit pipe, feeding into a rack switch with a 10-gigabit uplink.10<br />

        Over time older, smaller drives were phased out and replaced by <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">newer, bigger drives</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        By 2025, the storage landscape had shifted again. The current PetaBox racks provide 1.4 petabytes of storage per rack. This leap is achieved not by adding more slots, but by utilizing significantly larger drives—8TB, 16TB, and even 22TB drives are now standard. In 2016, the Archive managed around 20,000 individual disk drives. Remarkably, even as storage capacity tripled between 2012 and 2016, the total count of drives remained relatively constant due to these density improvements.
        </blockquote>
        This is indeed an impressive strory and Li <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">writes</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        The trajectory of the PetaBox is a case study in Moore's Law applied to magnetic storage.
        </blockquote>
        Here I have to correct Li. Moore's Law applies to silicon such as solid-state storage; it is <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kryders-law">Kryder's Law</a> that applies to magnetic storage such as the hard disks in the PetaBox.<br />
        <br />.
        Li notes the Archive's innovative approach to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">cooling the racks</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        The Archive's primary data center is located in the Richmond District of San Francisco, a neighborhood known for its perpetual fog and cool maritime climate. The building utilizes this ambient air for cooling. There is no traditional air conditioning in the PetaBox machine rooms. Instead, the servers are designed to run at slightly higher operational temperatures, and the excess heat generated by the spinning disks is captured and recirculated to heat the building during the damp San Francisco winters.<br />
         <br />
        This "waste heat" system is a closed loop of efficiency. The 60+ kilowatts of heat energy produced by a storage cluster is not a byproduct to be eliminated but a resource to be harvested. This design choice dramatically lowers the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) ratio of the facility, allowing the Archive to spend its limited funds on hard drives rather than electricity bills.
        </blockquote>

        Brian Wilson, CTO of BackBlaze <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/04/evercloud-workshop.html">pointed out</a> back in 2014 ago that in their long-term storage environment <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/">"Double the reliability is only worth 1/10th of 1 percent cost increase"</a>.

        <br />
        The Archive has followed this advice for a long time, as Li <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">explains</a>:<br />

        Since at least <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2011/09/modeling-economics-of-long-term-storage.html">2011</a> I have written repeatedly about the fact that preserving data for the long term is and economic, not a technical problem. With a lavish budget it is simple; the smaller the budget the harder it gets.  Li correctly points out that the Archive's budget, in the range of $25-30M/year, is vastly <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">lower than any comparable website</a>:<br />

        But in making this point he uses a <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting">flawed comparison</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Consider the cost of storing 100 petabytes on Amazon S3. At standard rates (~$0.021 per GB per month), the storage alone would cost over $2.1 million per month.

        First, Li ignores bandwidth charges, which as one of the most-visited sites on the Web would dwarf the storage charges.  Second, Li compares S3, intended for and priced as instantly accessible, replicated data for the back-end of mission-critical online services, with the Archive's storage, intended for the long-term storage of data, most of which is accessed very rarely. Amazon has products aimed at this market. As an example, writing a Petabyte to Amazon Glacier, storing it for a decade, and then reading it out at last year's prices would <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/archival-storage.html">cost just under $160K</a>.

        <br />
        The key to making storage affordable is <i>tiering</i>, moving data that hasn't been accessed recently down the storage hierarchy to cheaper media. Kestutis Patiejunas gave an excellent talk about this back in 2014. I discussed it in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html"><i>More on Facebook's "Cold Storage"</i></a>. Facebook was in the happy position of having an extremely accurate model of the access patterns to each of the small number of data types they stored, so could do an very good job of matching the data to the performance of the layer in their storage hierarchy that held it.

Bruce Li introduces his [_The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight Against Forgetting_](https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting) thus:

&#62; This report delves into the mechanics of the Internet Archive with the precision of a teardown. We will strip back the chassis to examine the custom-built PetaBox servers that heat the building without air conditioning. We will trace the evolution of the web crawlers—from the early tape-based dumps of Alexa Internet to the sophisticated browser-based bots of 2025. We will analyze the financial ledger of this non-profit giant, exploring how it survives on a budget that is a rounding error for its Silicon Valley neighbors. And finally, we will look to the future, where the &#34;Decentralized Web&#34; (DWeb) promises to fragment the Archive into a million pieces to ensure it can never be destroyed.

It is long, detailed, comprehensive and well worth reading in full. Below the fold I comment on the part about storage.

This picture shows Brewster Kahle with the Internet Archive&#39;s very first storage, tape drives holding crawls from [Alexa Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Internet), the Web traffic analysis company founded by Brewster and Bruce Gilliat in 1996 and, three years later, acquired by Amazon for $250M.

The first custom-designed Internet Archive storage system was version 1 of the [PetaBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetaBox), a vividly red-painted 1U system introduced in 2004. This picture shows a rack of them. I&#39;m familiar with them because the [LOCKSS Program](https://lockss.org) used them for some years.

They were great! Li [explains](https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting):

&#62; The first PetaBox rack, operational in June 2004, was a revelation in storage density. It held 100 terabytes (TB) of data—a massive sum at the time—while consuming only about 6 kilowatts of power. To put that in perspective, in 2003, the entire Wayback Machine was growing at a rate of just 12 terabytes per month.

The LOCKSS Program eventually [transitioned to 4U systems](http://www.lockss.org/locksswp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IDCC2013.pdf) similar to those then in use at [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/). Around the same time the Archive also moved to 4U systems for their [PetaBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetaBox).

As disk technology progressed the Archive continued [evolving the system](https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting):

&#62; The fourth-generation PetaBox, introduced around 2010, exemplified this density. Each rack contained 240 disks of 2 terabytes each, organized into 4U high rack mounts. These units were powered by Intel Xeon processors (specifically the E7-8870 series in later upgrades) with 12 gigabytes of RAM. The architecture relied on bonding pair of 1-gigabit interfaces to create a 2-gigabit pipe, feeding into a rack switch with a 10-gigabit uplink.10

Over time older, smaller drives were phased out and replaced by [newer, bigger drives](https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting):

&#62; By 2025, the storage landscape had shifted again. The current PetaBox racks provide 1.4 petabytes of storage per rack. This leap is achieved not by adding more slots, but by utilizing significantly larger drives—8TB, 16TB, and even 22TB drives are now standard. In 2016, the Archive managed around 20,000 individual disk drives. Remarkably, even as storage capacity tripled between 2012 and 2016, the total count of drives remained relatively constant due to these density improvements.

This is indeed an impressive strory and Li [writes](https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting):

&#62; The trajectory of the PetaBox is a case study in Moore&#39;s Law applied to magnetic storage.

Here I have to correct Li. Moore&#39;s Law applies to silicon such as solid-state storage; it is [Kryder&#39;s Law](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kryders-law) that applies to magnetic storage such as the hard disks in the PetaBox.

.
Li notes the Archive&#39;s innovative approach to [cooling the racks](https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting):

&#62; The Archive&#39;s primary data center is located in the Richmond District of San Francisco, a neighborhood known for its perpetual fog and cool maritime climate. The building utilizes this ambient air for cooling. There is no traditional air conditioning in the PetaBox machine rooms. Instead, the servers are designed to run at slightly higher operational temperatures, and the excess heat generated by the spinning disks is captured and recirculated to heat the building during the damp San Francisco winters.
&#62;
&#62; This &#34;waste heat&#34; system is a closed loop of efficiency. The 60+ kilowatts of heat energy produced by a storage cluster is not a byproduct to be eliminated but a resource to be harvested. This design choice dramatically lowers the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) ratio of the facility, allowing the Archive to spend its limited funds on hard drives rather than electricity bills.

In the unlikely, for San Francisco, event that the day is too hot, less-urgent tasks can be delayed, or some of the racks can have their clock rate reduced, disks put into sleep mode, or even be powered down. Redundancy means that the data will be available elsewhere.

Brian Wilson, CTO of BackBlaze [pointed out](https://blog.dshr.org/2014/04/evercloud-workshop.html) back in 2014 ago that in their long-term storage environment [&#34;Double the reliability is only worth 1/10th of 1 percent cost increase&#34;](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/). And thus that the moral of the story was &#34;design for failure and buy the cheapest components you can&#34;.

The Archive has followed this advice for a long time, as Li [explains](https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting):

&#62; With over 28,000 spinning disks in operation, drive failure is a statistical certainty. ...
&#62;
&#62; The PetaBox software is designed to be fault-tolerant. Data is mirrored across multiple machines, often in different physical locations (including data centers in Redwood City and Richmond, California, and copies in Europe and Canada).12 Because the data is not &#34;mission-critical&#34; in the sense of a live banking transaction, the Archive can tolerate a certain number of dead drives in a node before physical maintenance is required.

Here is Brian Wilson&#39;s [analysis](https://www.theregister.com/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/):

&#62; Replacing one drive takes about 15 minutes of work. If we have 30,000 drives and 2 percent fail, it takes 150 hours to replace those. In other words, one employee for one month of 8 hour days. Getting the failure rate down to 1 percent means you save 2 weeks of employee salary - maybe $5,000 total? The 30,000 drives costs you $4m.

[Back in 2006](https://blog.dshr.org/2007/06/petabyte-for-century.html) I started asking [_How Hard Is &#34;A Petabyte for a Century&#34;?_](https://blog.dshr.org/2008/01/how-hard-is-petabyte-for-century.html) and concluding that it was _really_ hard. By analogy between &#34;bit rot&#34; and radioactivity, I estimated that keeping a petabyte for a century with a 50% chance of no bit flips required a bit half-life [a hundred million times the age of the universe](https://blog.dshr.org/2007/06/petabyte-for-century.html). But that wasn&#39;t the [fundamental problem](https://blog.dshr.org/2008/01/how-hard-is-petabyte-for-century.html):

&#62; The basic point I was making was that even if we ignore all the evidence that we can&#39;t, and assume that we could actually build a system reliable enough to preserve a petabyte for a century, we could not prove that we had done so. No matter how easy or hard you think a problem is, if it is impossible to prove that you have solved it, scepticism about proposed solutions is inevitable.

We have to assume that, despite their best efforts, the Archive will over time lose some data. This isn&#39;t a problem for two reasons:

- The Archive&#39;s collection is, fundamentally, a _sample_ of cyberspace. Stuff missing is vastly more likely to be because it wasn&#39;t collected than because it was collected but subsequently lost.
- Driving the already low probability of loss down further gets exponentially more expensive.

        <![CDATA[Today's links AI is how bosses wage war on "professions": The only people *required* to tell their bosses to fuck off. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Enshittification v VC; Byrne v DRM; Forger does it for the exposure; Beach trash hotel; Mafia nicknames; Longbow puzzle; NIMBYs; No one should be on the No-Fly list. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. AI is how bosses wage war on "professions" (permalink) Growing up, I assumed that being a "professional" meant that you were getting paid to do something. That's a perfectly valid definition (I still remember feeling like a "pro" the first time I got paid for my writing), but "professional" has another, far more important definition. In this other sense of the word, a "professional" is someone bound to a code of conduct that supersedes both the demands of their employer and the demands of the state. Think of a doctor's Hippocratic Oath: having sworn to "first do no harm," a doctor is (literally) duty-bound to refuse orders to harm their patients. If a hospital administrator, a police officer or a judge orders a doctor to harm their patient, they are supposed to refuse. Indeed, depending on how you feel about oaths, they are required to refuse. There are many "professions" bound to codes of conduct, policed to a greater or lesser extent by "colleges" or other professional associations, many of which have the power to bar a member from the profession for "professional misconduct." Think of lawyers, accountants, medical professionals, librarians, teachers, some engineers, etc. While all of these fields are very different in terms of the work they do, they share one important trait: they are all fields that AI bros swear will be replaced by chatbots in the near future. I find this an interesting phenomenon. It's clear to me that chatbots can't do these jobs. Sure, there are instances in which professionals may choose to make use of some AI tools, and I'm happy to stipulate that when a skilled professional chooses to use AI as an adjunct to their work, it might go well. This is in keeping with my theory that to the extent that AI is useful, it's when its user is a centaur (a person assisted by technology), but that employers dream of making AI's users into reverse centaurs (machines who are assisted by people): https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington A psychotherapist who uses AI to transcribe sessions so they can refresh their memory about an exact phrase while they're making notes is a centaur. A psychotherapist who monitors 20 chat sessions with LLM "therapists" in order to intervene if the LLM starts telling patients to kill themselves is a "reverse centaur." This situation makes it impossible for them to truly help "their" patients; they are an "accountability sink," installed to absorb the blame when a patient is harmed by the AI. Lawyers might use a chatbot to help them format a brief or transcribe a client meeting (centaur)- but when senior partners require their juniors and paralegals to write briefs at inhuman speed (reverse centaur), they are setting themselves up for briefs full of "hallucinated" citations: https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/ I hold a bedrock view that even though an AI can't do your job, an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete But why are bosses such easy marks for these gabby AI hustlers? Partly, it's because an AI can probably do your boss's job &#8211; if 90% of your job is answering email and delegating tasks, and if you are richly rewarded for success but get to blame failure on your underlings, then, yeah, an AI can totally do that job. But I think there's an important psychological dimension to this: bosses are especially easy to trick with AI when they're being asked to believe that they can use AI to fire workers who are in a position to tell them to fuck off. That certainly explains why bosses are so thrilled by the prospect of swapping professionals for chatbots. What a relief it would be to fire everyone who is professionally required to tell you to fuck off when you want them to do stupid and/or dangerous things; so you could replace them with servile, groveling LLMs that punctuate their sentences with hymns to your vision and brilliance! This also explains why media bosses are so anxious to fire screenwriters and actors and replace them with AI. After all, you prompt an LLM in exactly the same way a clueless studio boss gives notes to a writers' room: "Give me ET, but make it about a dog, give it a love interest, and put a car chase in Act III." The difference is that the writers will call you a clueless fucking suit and demand that you go back to your spreadsheets and stop bothering them while they're trying to make a movie, whereas the chatbot will cheerfully shit out a (terrible) script to spec. The fact that the script will suck is less important than the fact that swapping writers for LLMs will let studio bosses escape ego-shattering conflicts with empowered workers who actually know how to do things. It also explains why bosses are so anxious to replace programmers with chatbots. When programmers were scarce and valuable, they had to be lured into employment with luxurious benefits, lavish pay, and a collegial relationship with their bosses, where everyone was "just an engineer." Tech companies had business-wide engineering meetings where techies were allowed to tell their bosses that they thought their technical and business strategies were stupid. Now that tech worker supply has caught up with demand, bosses are relishing the thought of firing these "entitled" coders and replacing them with chatbots overseen by traumatized reverse centaurs who will never, ever tell them to fuck off: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/05/ex-princes-of-labor/#hyper-criti-hype And of course, this explains why bosses are so eager to use AI to replace workers who might unionize: drivers, factory workers, warehouse workers. For what is a union if not an institution that lets you tell your boss to fuck off? https://www.thewrap.com/conde-nast-fires-union-staffers-video/ AI salesmen may be slick, but they're not that slick. Bosses are easy marks for anyone who dangles the promise of a world where everyone &#8211; human and machine &#8211; follows orders to the letter, and praises you for giving them such clever, clever orders.

I&rsquo;ve set it up such that file uploads are allowed and I&rsquo;ve set up a job on the server that deletes any uploads older than two weeks. Just to be a bit safer. If you set it up with accounts, then every user gets a log and therefore it&rsquo;s always on. Nobody needs to mess around with IRC bouncers like znc and proxies like WeeChat. <a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> is another option but it doesn&rsquo;t allow file uploads. And all the IRC nerds can still use IRC clients and paste-bins, of course.</p>
        
        <p>If you can, set up a <strong>Discord/IRC bridge</strong>. We run <a href="https://github.com/zachbr/Dis4IRC">Dis4IRC</a> to connect our servers. This is a bot that connects to both your Discord Server and your IRC server and sends messages back and forth. It looks ugly but it works. This allows a gradual transition. It makes sure that the backup plan works and nobody has to move immediately. But those who are curious can check it out and follow along.</p>
        
        <p>Set up a <strong>video conference server</strong>. I use <a href="https://galene.org/">Galène</a>. It was much easier to set up than Jitsi.</p>
        
        <p>None of these offer custom emoji, message editing, invite links, easily accessible roles and permissions, server management, etc. Things are going to be different.

      <source:markdown># 2026-01-07 Discord IPO, again

&#62; Chat platform Discord filed confidentially for an initial public offering in the United States, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. – [Chat platform Discord files confidentially for US IPO, Bloomberg News reports](https://www.reuters.com/business/chat-platform-discord-confidentially-file-us-ipo-bloomberg-news-reports-2026-01-06/), by Prakhar Srivastava and Nathan Gomes, for Reuters

If you’re in the position to host things for your friends, here’s what has worked for me and my friends.

Set up an **IRC server**. We used [ngircd](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd) because it can federate so now we have a little network of two servers. That’s good for resilience. There are more modern IRC servers but they don’t federate like that. If you don’t need federation, then by all means pick something new like [Ergo](https://ergo.chat/).

Set up a **web app** for your IRC server. Or more than one! Nobody has to know that it’s all IRC under the hood. The one I am using is [The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/). I’ve set it up such that file uploads are allowed and I’ve set up a job on the server that deletes any uploads older than two weeks. Just to be a bit safer. If you set it up with accounts, then every user gets a log and therefore it’s always on. Nobody needs to mess around with IRC bouncers like znc and proxies like WeeChat. [Convos](https://convos.chat/) is another option but it doesn’t allow file uploads. And all the IRC nerds can still use IRC clients and paste-bins, of course.

If you can, set up a **Discord/IRC bridge**. We run [Dis4IRC](https://github.com/zachbr/Dis4IRC) to connect our servers. This is a bot that connects to both your Discord Server and your IRC server and sends messages back and forth. It looks ugly but it works. This allows a gradual transition. It makes sure that the backup plan works and nobody has to move immediately. But those who are curious can check it out and follow along.

Set up a **video conference server**. I use [Galène](https://galene.org/). It was much easier to set up than Jitsi.

None of these offer custom emoji, message editing, invite links, easily accessible roles and permissions, server management, etc. Things are going to be different. All of the proposed solutions work on my small virtual machine I’m renting. This was important to me, too.

The age verification service Discord used just had [a data beach](https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service) exposing photos of government IDs for 70,000 people. Sooner or later, this will happen if perfect security is impossible. And now we have to ask ourselves: Was this a good trade-off?</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown># 2026-01-19 The Lounge for the elderly

[The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/) is a web app that acts as an always-on chat client for IRC. I use it all the time since I don’t have to understand how a “bouncer” like `znc` works to be always on, nor do I need to have a WeeChat proxy running somewhere.

I use it for our little network for role-playing game enthusiasts at [Grenzland](https://grenzland.club/) as well as [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/), [Tilde Chat](https://tilde.chat/) and two other, smaller IRC servers.

I use it on the phone, too. You can an “add it to the homescreen” and it works just fine. Until recently, I thought that the font-size was a problem, though. I’m over fifty and I like my text to be bigger these days. 😥

In The Lounge, click the cog wheel for Settings → Appearance and paste the following into the custom CSS at the bottom:

```
.header .title,
.header .topic,
.messages .msg,
.userlist,
input {
  font-size: 16pt;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
.channel-list-item {
  font-size: 13pt;
  padding: 4px 7px;
}
.channel-list-item[data-type=&#34;lobby&#34;] {
  font-size: 14pt;
}
/* input box, specially when not expanded */
#form #input {
  font-size: 13pt;
  padding: 1pt 7px;
  height: 15pt;
}
/* unread message count */
.channel-list-item .badge {
  font-size: 12pt;
}
#settings .error, .window label, .window li, .window p {
    font-size: 14pt;
}
/* phones and the like */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    #context-menu, #form #input, #help .help-item, #loading, #settings .error, #sidebar .empty, .channel-list-item, .header .topic, .messages .msg, .textcomplete-menu, .window label {
        font-size: 15pt;
    }
}
/* long usernames */
#chat .from {
  width: 15ch;
}

```

It probably still needs some tweaking but it’s already much better.

Here is also where you can change the theme. The screenshot below uses the “Morning” theme, plus an earlier version of the font-size changes given above.

I really like how the use of [web apps like The Lounge](2026-01-19-the-lounge) have been helping us get there.

At the same time, [@wandererbill](https://betola.de/wandererbill/) has offered an old server he had running and handed out staff membership to a lot of us. And we started setting stuff up. A [web site](https://grenzland.club/), a [wiki](https://wiki.grenzland.club/) (guess who did that…), a [MUD](https://wiki.grenzland.club/view/mud), another networked IRC server, a networked net news server. It has the vibe of a public access system (see [pubnix history](https://github.com/cwmccabe/pubnixhist)), a [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/) server or a [Super Dimensional Fortress](https://sdfeu.org/w/) (SDF). You get an account, things feel retro, but they don’t take a lot of resources and it’s all human scale.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>**[jordanhubbard/nanolang](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang)**

Plenty of people have mused about what a new programming language specifically designed to be used by LLMs might look like. Jordan Hubbard ( [co-founder of FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hubbard), with serious stints at Apple and NVIDIA) just released exactly that.

&#62; A minimal, LLM-friendly programming language with mandatory testing and unambiguous syntax.
&#62;
&#62; NanoLang transpiles to C for native performance while providing a clean, modern syntax optimized for both human readability and AI code generation.

The syntax strikes me as an interesting mix between C, Lisp and Rust.

I decided to see if an LLM could produce working code in it directly, given the necessary context. I started with this [MEMORY.md](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang/blob/main/MEMORY.md) file, which begins:

&#62; **Purpose:** This file is designed specifically for Large Language Model consumption. It contains the essential knowledge needed to generate, debug, and understand NanoLang code. Pair this with `spec.json` for complete language coverage.

I ran that using [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/) and [llm-anthropic](https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic) like this:

```
llm -m claude-opus-4.5 \
  -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang/refs/heads/main/MEMORY.md \
  &#39;Build me a mandelbrot fractal CLI tool in this language&#39;
  &#62; /tmp/fractal.nano

```

The [resulting code](https://gist.github.com/simonw/7847f022566d11629ec2139f1d109fb8#mandelbrot-fractal-cli-tool-in-nano)... [did not compile](https://gist.github.com/simonw/7847f022566d11629ec2139f1d109fb8?permalink_comment_id=5947465#gistcomment-5947465).

I may have been too optimistic expecting a one-shot working program for a new language like this. So I ran a clone of the actual project, copied in my program and had Claude Code take a look at the failing compiler output.

... and it worked! Claude happily grepped its way through the various `examples/` and built me a working program.

Here&#39;s [the Claude Code transcript](https://gisthost.github.io/?9696da6882cb6596be6a9d5196e8a7a5/index.html) \- you can see it [reading relevant examples here](https://gisthost.github.io/?9696da6882cb6596be6a9d5196e8a7a5/page-001.html#msg-2026-01-19T23-43-09-675Z) \- and here&#39;s [the finished code plus its output](https://gist.github.com/simonw/e7f3577adcfd392ab7fa23b1295d00f2).

I&#39;ve suspected [for a while](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/7/llms-for-new-programming-languages/) that LLMs and coding agents might significantly reduce the friction involved in launching a new language. This result reinforces my opinion.

        <![CDATA[I finally set aside some time to read Django Views — The Right Way. Luke Plant makes a very persuasive argument for view functions (FBV) - especially about their being more explicit especially when it comes to the transparency of passing request into each view function. He is quite negative about class-based views (CBV). I kind of agree about CBVs hiding details and making it harder to know what to change. I would be lost without the Classy Class-Based Views site but Luke’s critiques are more about CBVs creating layers of indirection and actually introducing extra boilerplate as compared to FBVs.]]>

      <title>Pluralistic: Social media without socializing (19 Jan 2026)</title>
      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/19/billionaire-solipsism/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links Social media without socializing: For Zuck, your friends are a problem to be solved. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: "Among Others"; Vagina tea-balls; MLK was a socialist; Planet Money's free Gatsby audiobook; Bounty for wiretapping lefty profs; Poe's graveside ritual; Sleep Mafia; Whence came tarps; GM's Dieslgate; NRO's octopus; Amazon solidarity; Billionaire-proofing the internet. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Social media without socializing (permalink) From the earliest days of social media, social media bosses have been at war with sociability. To create a social media service is to demarcate legitimate and illegitimate forms of sociability. It's a monumental act of hubris, really. It was ever thus. The founder of Friendster decreed that people could only form friendship bonds with each other, but could not declare themselves to be "friends" of everyone with a common interest. You and I could be friends, but you couldn't be "friends" with a group called "bloggers." Each member of that group would have to create a reciprocal friendship link to see one another's feeds. Way back in 1999, Larry Lessig taught us that "code is law." By encoding these restrictions into the feed, Friendster's programmers were putting limits on the kinds of relationships that could be formed using the service. But Lessig's law (code?) is often overidden by an even older principle: William Gibson's 1982 maxim that "the street finds its own uses for things." Friendster told its users how to be friends with one another, and Friendster's users treated Friendster's management as damage and routed around it. They created accounts with names like "New York City" and whenever anyone friended that account, it friended them back. Users hacked their own way to form "illegitimate" friendships based on affinity into the system: https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2003/08/17/the_fakester_manifesto.html As social media turned into a billion- (and then a trillion-) dollar business, the urgency of the struggle between how social media bosses demanded that we socialize and how we wanted to socialize only got sharper. Mark Zuckerberg doubtless thought he was covering all his bases when he tossed a casual "It's complicated" to the pulldown menu for defining your relationship status, but that's because he doesn't understand how complicated all our relationships are: https://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/07/10/facebook-complicated-relationship-status/ For Zuck, crisply defined relationships were things that he could do simple math on in order to target ads, make recommendations, and sort users into categories. When you need to treat relationships as elements in a series of discrete mathematical operations, the fact that relationships are intrinsically, irreducibly qualitative is a serious bug. So Zuck did what computer scientists usually do when they want to do math on qualitative variables: he incinerated all the qualitative elements by quantizing them, and then did math on the dubious residue that remained: https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-qualia/ Zuck's biggest problem isn't the ambiguity of your social connections, though &#8211; it's that they exist at all. Think about it: Mark Zuckerberg personally makes or loses billions of dollars based on how much you socialize with your friends on his platforms. If your friends engage with you in ways that are low intensity and easily concluded ("How'd you sleep?" "Just fine." "That's nice."), then he loses. If, on the other hand, you and your friends get into protracted, intense interactions, he gets to show you so many ads and make so much money. Your friends are a problem for Mark Zuckerberg to solve, and (to his undying chagrin), you and your friends stubbornly refuse to organize your relationships around Zuck's financial imperatives. You just wanna hang out in the rhythms that are part of any friendship &#8211; sometimes intense, sometimes casual, often sporadic. I mean, honestly, if you're going to insist on just having normal friendships, how the hell can Mark Zuckerberg post the kind of growth his shareholders expect? This explains much of the drive to transform Facebook from a platform that shows you the things your friends post to a platform that mostly shows you things that "content creators" post. Your friends aren't motivated by the dangling possibility of viral dollars if they get you to "engage" with their posts, but for content creators, your engagement buys the groceries and pays the rent. By swapping out your friends and replacing them with people who are highly motivated to "engage" with you, Zuck gets a lever he can yank to get his users to arrange their conduct in ways that goose his growth. In other words, Zuck lured you in with the promise of having pleasurable online conversations that matter to you; and now that he's trapped you, he wants you to break up with your friends so you have more time to watch his community access cable station. It also explains Zuck's passion for filling his platform with botshit, and his plan to solve the loneliness epidemic by giving you chatbots instead of friends: https://fortune.com/2025/06/26/mark-zuckerberg-ai-friends-hinge-ceo/ For Mark Zuckerberg, all people are just shitty chatbots &#8211; chatbots that won't follow orders. He wants to be able to point us at one another in the hopes that we will simply prompt one another into endless chatter, with endless scrolling, and endless ad insertions. This works great with chatbots, not so well with people: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNagNezo8w After all, Zuck doesn't really believe most other people exist. Read Careless People, Sarah Wynn-Williams's tell-all whistleblower memoir about her years at Facebook and you'll quickly realize that for Zuck, people are statistical artifacts, not co-equal beings worthy of moral consideration: https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf Billionaires are plagued by solipsism. Not believing other people exist is a great aid to billionairedom, because it lets you amass your fortune without scrupling over the population-scale misery you're inflicting on the way: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs For Zuck, AI is the most exciting technology in history (even more exciting than the Metaverse, if you can believe it!) because it might give him the world he dreams of: a world without people, or, at very least, a social media network without any socializing: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism Hey look at this (permalink) Congress Wants To Hand Your Parenting to Big Tech https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/congress-wants-hand-your-parenting-big-tech AI companies will fail.

Upcoming books: Like I said, I&#39;ll keep writin&#39; &#39;em. Colophon: All the rest. Social media without socializing (permalink) From the earliest days of social media, social media bosses have been at war with sociability. To create a social media service is to demarcate legitimate and illegitimate forms of sociability. It&#39;s a monumental act of hubris, really. It was ever thus. The founder of Friendster decreed that people could only form friendship bonds with each other, but could not declare themselves to be &#34;friends&#34; of everyone with a common interest. You and I could be friends, but you couldn&#39;t be &#34;friends&#34; with a group called &#34;bloggers.&#34; Each member of that group would have to create a reciprocal friendship link to see one another&#39;s feeds. Way back in 1999, Larry Lessig taught us that &#34;code is law.&#34; By encoding these restrictions into the feed, Friendster&#39;s programmers were putting limits on the kinds of relationships that could be formed using the service. But Lessig&#39;s law (code?) is often overidden by an even older principle: William Gibson&#39;s 1982 maxim that &#34;the street finds its own uses for things.&#34; Friendster told its users how to be friends with one another, and Friendster&#39;s users treated Friendster&#39;s management as damage and routed around it. They created accounts with names like &#34;New York City&#34; and whenever anyone friended that account, it friended them back. Users hacked their own way to form &#34;illegitimate&#34; friendships based on affinity into the system: https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2003/08/17/the\_fakester\_manifesto.html As social media turned into a billion- (and then a trillion-) dollar business, the urgency of the struggle between how social media bosses demanded that we socialize and how we wanted to socialize only got sharper. Mark Zuckerberg doubtless thought he was covering all his bases when he tossed a casual &#34;It&#39;s complicated&#34; to the pulldown menu for defining your relationship status, but that&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t understand how complicated all our relationships are: https://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/07/10/facebook-complicated-relationship-status/ For Zuck, crisply defined relationships were things that he could do simple math on in order to target ads, make recommendations, and sort users into categories. When you need to treat relationships as elements in a series of discrete mathematical operations, the fact that relationships are intrinsically, irreducibly qualitative is a serious bug. So Zuck did what computer scientists usually do when they want to do math on qualitative variables: he incinerated all the qualitative elements by quantizing them, and then did math on the dubious residue that remained: https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-qualia/ Zuck&#39;s biggest problem isn&#39;t the ambiguity of your social connections, though – it&#39;s that they exist at all. Think about it: Mark Zuckerberg personally makes or loses billions of dollars based on how much you socialize with your friends on his platforms. If your friends engage with you in ways that are low intensity and easily concluded (&#34;How&#39;d you sleep?&#34; &#34;Just fine.&#34; &#34;That&#39;s nice.&#34;), then he loses. If, on the other hand, you and your friends get into protracted, intense interactions, he gets to show you so many ads and make so much money. Your friends are a problem for Mark Zuckerberg to solve, and (to his undying chagrin), you and your friends stubbornly refuse to organize your relationships around Zuck&#39;s financial imperatives. You just wanna hang out in the rhythms that are part of any friendship – sometimes intense, sometimes casual, often sporadic. I mean, honestly, if you&#39;re going to insist on just having normal friendships, how the hell can Mark Zuckerberg post the kind of growth his shareholders expect? This explains much of the drive to transform Facebook from a platform that shows you the things your friends post to a platform that mostly shows you things that &#34;content creators&#34; post. Your friends aren&#39;t motivated by the dangling possibility of viral dollars if they get you to &#34;engage&#34; with their posts, but for content creators, your engagement buys the groceries and pays the rent. By swapping out your friends and replacing them with people who are highly motivated to &#34;engage&#34; with you, Zuck gets a lever he can yank to get his users to arrange their conduct in ways that goose his growth. In other words, Zuck lured you in with the promise of having pleasurable online conversations that matter to you; and now that he&#39;s trapped you, he wants you to break up with your friends so you have more time to watch his community access cable station. It also explains Zuck&#39;s passion for filling his platform with botshit, and his plan to solve the loneliness epidemic by giving you chatbots instead of friends: https://fortune.com/2025/06/26/mark-zuckerberg-ai-friends-hinge-ceo/ For Mark Zuckerberg, all people are just shitty chatbots – chatbots that won&#39;t follow orders. He wants to be able to point us at one another in the hopes that we will simply prompt one another into endless chatter, with endless scrolling, and endless ad insertions. This works great with chatbots, not so well with people: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNagNezo8w After all, Zuck doesn&#39;t really believe most other people exist. Read Careless People, Sarah Wynn-Williams&#39;s tell-all whistleblower memoir about her years at Facebook and you&#39;ll quickly realize that for Zuck, people are statistical artifacts, not co-equal beings worthy of moral consideration: https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/23/zuckerstreisand/#zdgaf Billionaires are plagued by solipsism. Not believing other people exist is a great aid to billionairedom, because it lets you amass your fortune without scrupling over the population-scale misery you&#39;re inflicting on the way: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs For Zuck, AI is the most exciting technology in history (even more exciting than the Metaverse, if you can believe it!) because it might give him the world he dreams of: a world without people, or, at very least, a social media network without any socializing: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism Hey look at this (permalink) Congress Wants To Hand Your Parenting to Big Tech https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/congress-wants-hand-your-parenting-big-tech AI companies will fail.

        <p>Did you know I can speak in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uff_da">uff-da</a> accent? Brought to you by three wonderful years in Wisconsin at the UW in Madison. Fuck em Bucky!</p>
        <p>Now, I've been on a project to get my eating habits down for more weight loss and better health. I have Facebook reels to thank for that. I've been listening to all the science and advice about keeping your bloodstream sugar from spiking while still eating well. And the more I listen to the advice, the more advice I get. </p>
        <p>I love eating a bowl of oatmeal in the morning with some crushed walnuts, butter, raisins, and after it's cooked for five minutes in the microwave, some fresh berries mixed in. But I figured this isn't good. I've been taught that a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LS1rYqGFcMg">savory breakfast</a> is better. So I had a two-egg omelet with melted cheese and half an english muffin with butter. I couldn't even finish the muffin. I feel full. And I'm drinking my coffee made with my Kuerig. </p>
        <p>It was a rough night last night. I'm so exhausted with feeling the whole world crumbling around us. Trump wants to take us back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)">Robber Baron</a> America of the 19th century. I hear that sucked. We have to get together and say out loud everywhere this is not cool. Democrats and Republicans in Congress, we elected you to check this kind of bullshit. If you don't do your jobs, Senators and Representatives -- we're going to vote you out next chance we get, I don't care if you're a Democrat. </p>
        <p>The Democrats have a great opportunity now, I hear, to put an end to ICE. Do it, or else you're history, politically. You can't have a career going forward if you're on the wrong side of this one. </p>
        <p>And btw, proof that life goes on -- I am so sick of snow. It had to come on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_States">holiday weekend</a> when there's no point trying to go skiing because the lift lines and crowds on the slope take all the fun out of it. And this is great skiing snow, light and fluffy. I hope some of it is still around later in the week.</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>![](https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/09/14/bucky.png)First, glad I wrote the political blog post [yesterday](http://scripting.com/2026/01/18.html#a180328). Enough is enough. I love Minnesota. I want to wear a Minnesota baseball cap today. I want to fly a Minnesota flag on my front lawn. And I want Congress to do their job and put a stop to this bullshit before Trump sends the US army into Minneapolis, putting our fine American soldiers in an intolerable place, to refuse to obey an order because it&#39;s obviously wrong. What Congress can do is make it an _illegal_ order. Take the burden off the miltary.

Did you know I can speak in an [uff-da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uff_da) accent? Brought to you by three wonderful years in Wisconsin at the UW in Madison. Fuck em Bucky!

Now, I&#39;ve been on a project to get my eating habits down for more weight loss and better health. I have Facebook reels to thank for that.

      <title>Trad travels</title>
      <link>https://adactio.com/journal/22363</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>For the past few years, I’ve been <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22166">taking a trip to Spain</a> at the end of September for the <a href="https://www.irishfleadh.com/">Cáceres Irish Fleadh</a>. Last year I convinced my friends Liam and Monica to come along and they had a great time.</p>
        
        <p>Like me, Liam just loves playing in sessions. Also like me, Liam likes to spend the gloomy short days of January thinking about travelling somewhere …and then playing in sessions there.</p>
        
        <p>I told him I’d put together a list of potential trips for the discerning session hound. I figured I might as well share it here too…</p>
        
        <p>First of all, there are Irish music festivals. Alas, most festivals don’t happen in the sunny climes of Spain. As you’d expect, most of them are in Ireland.</p>
        
        <p>I’m heading to Carlingford at the end of this month for a weekend of <a href="https://www.feilenatana.com/">Féile na Tána</a>. I haven’t been before but it looks good. There’ll be the usual amalgam of workshops, concerts, and sessions.</p>
        
        <p>Myself and <a href="https://wordridden.com/">Jessica</a> will fly in to Belfast, then take the train down to Newry and get to Carlingford from there. You could fly into Dublin and get the train up to Dundalk, but the only Gatwick flights to Dublin are Ryan Air, and I’d rather entrust my instrument to EasyJet.</p>
        
        <p>At the end of March we’re heading to <a href="https://www.tullamoretradfest.com/">Tullamore Trad Fest</a>. That’s another one we haven’t been to before. Again, there’ll be workshops, concerts, and sessions.</p>
        
        <p>Tullamore is just an hour away from Dublin by train and has plenty of accommodation options. We’ve booked into <a href="https://www.seadewhouse.com/">a nice-looking B&amp;B</a>.</p>
        
        <p>There’s no avoiding Ryan Air for this trip and I want to take my good mandolin, so I’ve gone ahead and <a href="https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-gb/articles/12889013645713-What-music-equipment-can-I-bring-on-board">booked a separate seat</a> for it. I don’t want to take any chances with an airline that actively seeks to elevate misery.</p>
        
        <p>The festival I heartily recommend is <a href="https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/">Belfast Trad Fest</a> at the end of July. It’s super convenient to get to with EasyJet flights from Gatwick—go to Belfast <em>city</em> airport, which is right downtown.</p>
        
        <p>The festival offers a really good accommodation deal in modern student flats. The workshops are top-notch, and best of all, it has a really well-organised session trail. You can easily play in sessions all afternoon and evening.</p>
        
        <p>This year, for the first time ever, Belfast trad fest is immediately followed by <a href="https://fleadhcheoil.ie/">the all-Ireland fleadh</a>, which promises to be pandemonium. I’ve never been to the fleadh before but I’m going to stick around Belfast for it.</p>
        
        <p>You could head to the <a href="https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/">Willie Clancy Festival</a> in Miltown Malbay at the start of July (the website seems to be having some issues right now). But good luck finding accommodation. The event is so big now that unless you’re camping, there’s not much chance of finding a place to stay. If you make it there though, non-stop sessions await. Non-stop chaos awaits too. That’s part of the deal. Great workshops though!</p>
        
        <p>There are other festivals I haven’t been to but I’ve heard great things about. <a href="https://patrickokeeffefestival.com/">The Pádraig O’Keeffe Festival</a> in Kerry in October sounds fantastic, especially if you like your polkas and slides. But it’s in Castleisland, which doesn’t have much in the way of accommodation. So unless you’ve got transport, it’s going to be tricky.</p>
        
        <p>There’s <a href="https://kilkennytradfest.com/">a trad fest in Kilkenny in March</a>. I’ve never been but they’ve got a session trail. You’d need to fly into either Dublin or Cork and then get on a bus. Either way, it’s Ryan Air from Gatwick.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve also never been to the <a href="https://ennistradfest.com/">Ennis Trad Fest</a> in county Clare in November but I’ve heard good things. Accommodation for the 2026 event is already in short supply though.</p>
        
        <p>But you don’t need a festival to play in sessions. In fact, the kind of sessions you end up in at festivals have a different vibe to the usual sessions, simply because they’re formed of a hodge-podge of visiting players.</p>
        
        <p>There a few spots in Ireland where you’re guaranteed a session pretty much any night of the week.</p>
        
        <p>I love Galway. There are afternoon sessions in Taafe’s and Tigh Cóilí as well as evening sessions in the Crane and other places. You’d need to fly into Dublin and get the train from there. It takes about two hours.</p>
        
        <p>Galway is busy in the summer time and accommodation can be pricy, but if you go off-season you can find some cheaper options.</p>
        
        <p>Ennis has <a href="https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Ennis%2C+Clare%2C+Ireland">music most nights</a>. There’s a regular bus service between Ennis and Shannon airport that’s nice and quick. You’d need to fly Ryan Air from Gatwick though.</p>
        
        <p>And then there’s Belfast again. Even when the trad fest isn’t happening, Belfast has sessions seven nights a week. Check out the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/belfastsessionguide/">Belfast session guide Instagram account</a> for up-to-date details.</p>
        
        <p>I recommend staying in <a href="https://www.theflintbelfast.com/">The Flint</a>, but make sure you ask for a room on the top floor far away from the nightclub if you’re there on a weekend.</p>
        
        <p>So, to recap, here are some festivals to check out:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.feilenatana.com/">Féile na Tána</a> in Carlingford, county Louth in January (I’m going),</li>

        </ul>

      <source:markdown>For the past few years, I’ve been [taking a trip to Spain](https://adactio.com/journal/22166) at the end of September for the [Cáceres Irish Fleadh](https://www.irishfleadh.com/). Last year I convinced my friends Liam and Monica to come along and they had a great time.

Like me, Liam just loves playing in sessions. Also like me, Liam likes to spend the gloomy short days of January thinking about travelling somewhere …and then playing in sessions there.

I told him I’d put together a list of potential trips for the discerning session hound. I figured I might as well share it here too…

First of all, there are Irish music festivals. Alas, most festivals don’t happen in the sunny climes of Spain. As you’d expect, most of them are in Ireland.

I’m heading to Carlingford at the end of this month for a weekend of [Féile na Tána](https://www.feilenatana.com/). I haven’t been before but it looks good. There’ll be the usual amalgam of workshops, concerts, and sessions.

Myself and [Jessica](https://wordridden.com/) will fly in to Belfast, then take the train down to Newry and get to Carlingford from there. You could fly into Dublin and get the train up to Dundalk, but the only Gatwick flights to Dublin are Ryan Air, and I’d rather entrust my instrument to EasyJet.

At the end of March we’re heading to [Tullamore Trad Fest](https://www.tullamoretradfest.com/). That’s another one we haven’t been to before. Again, there’ll be workshops, concerts, and sessions.

Tullamore is just an hour away from Dublin by train and has plenty of accommodation options. We’ve booked into [a nice-looking B&#38;B](https://www.seadewhouse.com/).

There’s no avoiding Ryan Air for this trip and I want to take my good mandolin, so I’ve gone ahead and [booked a separate seat](https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-gb/articles/12889013645713-What-music-equipment-can-I-bring-on-board) for it. I don’t want to take any chances with an airline that actively seeks to elevate misery.

The festival I heartily recommend is [Belfast Trad Fest](https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/) at the end of July. It’s super convenient to get to with EasyJet flights from Gatwick—go to Belfast _city_ airport, which is right downtown.

The festival offers a really good accommodation deal in modern student flats. The workshops are top-notch, and best of all, it has a really well-organised session trail. You can easily play in sessions all afternoon and evening.

This year, for the first time ever, Belfast trad fest is immediately followed by [the all-Ireland fleadh](https://fleadhcheoil.ie/), which promises to be pandemonium. I’ve never been to the fleadh before but I’m going to stick around Belfast for it.

You could head to the [Willie Clancy Festival](https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/) in Miltown Malbay at the start of July (the website seems to be having some issues right now). But good luck finding accommodation. The event is so big now that unless you’re camping, there’s not much chance of finding a place to stay. If you make it there though, non-stop sessions await. Non-stop chaos awaits too. That’s part of the deal. Great workshops though!

There are other festivals I haven’t been to but I’ve heard great things about. [The Pádraig O’Keeffe Festival](https://patrickokeeffefestival.com/) in Kerry in October sounds fantastic, especially if you like your polkas and slides. But it’s in Castleisland, which doesn’t have much in the way of accommodation. So unless you’ve got transport, it’s going to be tricky.

There’s [a trad fest in Kilkenny in March](https://kilkennytradfest.com/). I’ve never been but they’ve got a session trail. You’d need to fly into either Dublin or Cork and then get on a bus. Either way, it’s Ryan Air from Gatwick.

I’ve also never been to the [Ennis Trad Fest](https://ennistradfest.com/) in county Clare in November but I’ve heard good things. Accommodation for the 2026 event is already in short supply though.

But you don’t need a festival to play in sessions. In fact, the kind of sessions you end up in at festivals have a different vibe to the usual sessions, simply because they’re formed of a hodge-podge of visiting players.

There a few spots in Ireland where you’re guaranteed a session pretty much any night of the week.

I love Galway. There are afternoon sessions in Taafe’s and Tigh Cóilí as well as evening sessions in the Crane and other places. You’d need to fly into Dublin and get the train from there. It takes about two hours.

Galway is busy in the summer time and accommodation can be pricy, but if you go off-season you can find some cheaper options.

Ennis has [music most nights](https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Ennis%2C+Clare%2C+Ireland). There’s a regular bus service between Ennis and Shannon airport that’s nice and quick. You’d need to fly Ryan Air from Gatwick though.

And then there’s Belfast again. Even when the trad fest isn’t happening, Belfast has sessions seven nights a week. Check out the [Belfast session guide Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/belfastsessionguide/) for up-to-date details.

I recommend staying in [The Flint](https://www.theflintbelfast.com/), but make sure you ask for a room on the top floor far away from the nightclub if you’re there on a weekend.

So, to recap, here are some festivals to check out:

- [Féile na Tána](https://www.feilenatana.com/) in Carlingford, county Louth in January (I’m going),
- [Tullamore Trad Fest](https://www.tullamoretradfest.com/) in county Offaly in March (I’m going),
- [Kilkenny Trad Fest](https://kilkennytradfest.com/) also in March,
- [Scoil Samhraidh Willie Clancy](https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/) in Miltown Malbay, county Clare in July,
- [Belfast Trad Fest](https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/) at the end of July (I’m going),
- [Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann](https://fleadhcheoil.ie/) also in Belfast at the start of August (I’m going),
- [Cáceres Irish Fleadh](https://www.irishfleadh.com/) in Spain in September (I’m going),
- [The Pádraig O’Keeffe festival](https://patrickokeeffefestival.com/) in Castleisland, county Kerry in October, and
- [Ennis Trad Fest](https://ennistradfest.com/) in county Clare in November.

And then for year-round session action, you can visit:

- [Galway](https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Galway,+Ireland),
- [Ennis](https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Ennis%2C+Clare%2C+Ireland), and
- [Belfast](https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Belfast,+Antrim,+Northern%20Ireland)</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents">Scaling long-running autonomous coding</a></strong></p>

      <source:markdown>**[Scaling long-running autonomous coding](https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents)**

Wilson Lin at Cursor has been doing some experiments to see how far you can push a large fleet of &#34;autonomous&#34; coding agents:

&#62; This post describes what we&#39;ve learned from running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project, coordinating their work, and watching them write over a million lines of code and trillions of tokens.

They ended up running planners and sub-planners to create tasks, then having workers execute on those tasks - similar to how Claude Code uses sub-agents. Each cycle ended with a judge agent deciding if the project was completed or not.

In my predictions for 2026 [the other day](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-someone-will-build-a-new-browser-using-mainly-ai-assisted-coding-and-it-won-t-even-be-a-surprise) I said that by 2029:

&#62; I think somebody will have built a full web browser mostly using AI assistance, and it won’t even be surprising. Rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine\[...\] the cheat code is the conformance suites. If there are existing tests that it’ll get so much easier.

I may have been off by three years, because Cursor chose &#34;building a web browser from scratch&#34; as their test case for their agent swarm approach:

&#62; To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore [the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender).

But how well did they do? Their initial announcement a couple of days ago was met with [unsurprising skepticism](https://embedding-shapes.github.io/cursor-implied-success-without-evidence/), especially when it became apparent that their GitHub Actions CI was failing and there were no build instructions in the repo.

It looks like they addressed that within the past 24 hours. The [latest README](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/blob/main/README.md#build-requirements) includes build instructions which I followed on macOS like this:

```
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender
cd fastrender
git submodule update --init vendor/ecma-rs
cargo run --release --features browser_ui --bin browser

```

This got me a working browser window! Here are screenshots I took of google.com and my own website:

![The browser chrome is neat but has a garbled tab name at the top. The Google homepage looks mostly correct but the buttons are not styled correctly and the Google Search one has a huge plus icon floating near it.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/cursor-google.png)

![My blog looks mostly correct, but the right closing quotation mark on a quotation (which is implemented as a background image on the final paragraph) is displayed incorrectly multiple times.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/cursor-simonwillison.jpg)

      <source:markdown>## Introduction

Hello! I’m Sahil Patidar, and this summer I had the opportunity to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 with the LLVM Organization.My project focused on enhancing ORC-JIT and `Clang-Repl` by introducing a new feature for advanced symbol resolution, aimed at improving runtime symbol handling and flexibility.

**Mentors**: Vassil Vassilev, Aaron Jomy

## Overview of the Project

[Clang-Repl](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangRepl.html) is an interactive C++ interpreter built on top of LLVM’s ORC JIT, enabling incremental compilation and execution.However, when user code references symbols from external libraries, those libraries must currently be loaded manually. This happens because ORC JIT does not automatically resolve symbols from libraries that haven’t been loaded yet.

To overcome this limitation, my project introduces an automatic library resolver for unresolved symbols in ORC JIT, improving Clang-Repl’s runtime by making external symbol handling seamless and user-friendly.

## Project Goals

The main goal of my project was to design and implement a new Library-Resolution API for ORC-JIT.This API acts as a smart symbol resolver — when ORC-JIT encounters an unresolved symbol, it can call this API to find where the symbol exists and which library provides it.

The next step is to integrate this API into ORC-JIT, so that `Clang-Repl` can automatically use it to handle missing symbols without requiring manual library loading.

## Library-Resolution: Smarter Symbol Resolver

During my GSoC project, one of the major components I worked on was Library-Resolution — an API we re-designed and re-implemented based on Cling’s original library-resolver.

In simple terms, Library-Resolution acts as a smart library resolver.It doesn’t actually load libraries — instead, it finds where the missing symbols (unresolved references) can be found and provides their correct library paths.

This makes it a powerful helper when dealing with unresolved symbols during execution.

### How It Works

When system (Orc-JIT or any) encounters an unresolved symbol, system can call the resolver to find symbols that not found.It scans through user-provided library paths, checks potential matches, and identifies the libraries that contain the missing symbols — all without directly loading them.

At the heart of this system is the `LibraryResolver`, which runs the resolution process by:

1. Scanning available libraries.
2. Filtering symbols efficiently using Bloom filters.
3. Matching unresolved symbols through a `SymbolQuery` tracker.

The result: symbols are mapped to their correct library paths, and system can continue execution seamlessly.

### Core Components Overview

Here’s a quick breakdown of the key components that make Library-Resolution work:

#### 1\. LibraryResolver

The main coordinator that controls the entire flow — from scanning libraries to managing symbol lookups.It ensures that unresolved symbols are systematically matched to libraries.

#### 2\. LibraryScanner

Handles the actual scanning of directories and library paths.It detects valid shared libraries and registers them with the `LibraryManager`.

- **LibraryScanHelper** → Keeps track of directories that need to be scanned.
- **LibrarySearchPath** → Represents a directory and its type (User/System) along with its current scan state.
- **PathResolver** → Normalizes and resolves file paths efficiently.
- **LibraryPathCache** → Stores already-resolved paths and symbolic links to prevent repeated filesystem checks.

#### 3\. LibraryManager

Maintains metadata about all discovered libraries.Each library is represented by a `LibraryInfo` object containing:

- Library path
- Load status (loaded or not)
- A **Bloom filter** for fast symbol existence checks

### Symbol Resolution Flow

Here’s how everything fits together in the resolution process:

1. **Start**: The process begins with a list of unresolved symbols, passed to the `LibraryResolver` to create a `SymbolQuery`.
2. **Scan**: The resolver scans user and system library paths to find new or unregistered libraries.
3. **Cache &#38; Filter**: For each library, if it doesn’t yet have a Bloom filter, one is created to enable faster lookups in future scans.
4. **Match**: Each unresolved symbol is tested against these filters. If a likely match is found and verified, the symbol is linked to that library’s path.
5. **Repeat**: This continues until all symbols are resolved or no more valid libraries remain.
6. **Complete**: The results are returned through a completion callback.

## Summary of accomplished tasks

### ExecutorResolver:

[143654](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/143654) suggested by @lhames.we introduced a `DylibSymbolResolver` that helps resolve symbols for each loaded dylib.

Previously, we returned a DylibHandle to the controller. Now, we wrap the native handle inside `DylibSymbolResolver` and return a `ResolverHandle` instead. This makes the code cleaner and separates the symbol resolution logic from raw handle management.

with this changes this will help us to integrate LibraryResolver API using some future through new `AutoDylibResolver`.

### Library-Resolver API:

[#165360](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/165360)

This is the main API we redesigned based on cling auto library-resolver. this api provide way to user to add search-path and ask for symbols to search and provide resolved library for each symbols.

## Result: What the Library-Resolution API Enables

With these updates, we now have a fully functional Library-Resolution API that can dynamically resolve missing symbols to their correct shared libraries — all without loading the libraries directly.

This new system can **discover**, **query**, and **match** unresolved symbols across user and system paths, providing the exact library paths where those symbols exist. It serves as a powerful helper for ORC-JIT and Clang-Repl’s runtime infrastructure.

Here’s a short example showing how the API can be configured and used to trigger the resolution process:

```cpp
llvm::orc::LibraryResolver::Setup S = llvm::orc::LibraryResolver::Setup::create({});// Define a callback that decides whether a library should be scannedS.ShouldScanCall = [&#38;](llvm::StringRef lib) -&#62; bool { return true; };// Create the driver that coordinates the resolutionController = llvm::orc::LibraryResolutionDriver::create(S);// Add user and system library paths to be scannedfor (const auto &#38;SP : SearchPaths) Controller-&#62;addScanPath(SP, llvm::orc::PathType::User);// Prepare the symbols to be resolvedstd::vector&#60;std::string&#62; Sym;Sym.push_back(MangledName);// Configure resolution policyllvm::orc::SearchConfig Config;Config.Policy = { {{llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Queried, llvm::orc::PathType::User}, {llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Unloaded, llvm::orc::PathType::User}, {llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Queried, llvm::orc::PathType::System}, {llvm::orc::LibraryManager::LibState::Unloaded, llvm::orc::PathType::System}}};Config.Options.FilterFlags = llvm::orc::SymbolEnumeratorOptions::IgnoreUndefined;// Run the symbol resolutionController-&#62;resolveSymbols( Sym, [&#38;](llvm::orc::LibraryResolver::SymbolQuery &#38;Q) { if (auto S = Q.getResolvedLib(MangledName)) Res = *S; }, Config);
```

## Additional Improvements

&#62; **Note:** This post describes ongoing design work. The implementation is still under review and may evolve as feedback is incorporated.

During this phase, I worked on value-printing support for both **in-process** and **out-of-process** execution in `Clang-Repl`.Previously, `Clang-Repl` only supported value printing in the in-process mode, and the same implementation couldn’t be directly applied to the out-of-process case.

### Challenges

1. **Dependency on type information**

   The value-printing logic depends on the type information of the JIT-compiled expression result to correctly interpret and cast the result into a `Value` object.In the in-process setup, this is straightforward — process symbols such as `__clang_interpreter*`, which are used to capture the result at runtime along with its type information, reside within the controller. This allows the call to use pointer type information directly to interpret the resulting value correctly.However, in the out-of-process setup, those symbols exist in the controller, while the actual evaluated result resides in the executor. Even if we set up the runtime call in the executor, we still need to access the type information that remains on the controller side.

2. **No direct executor-to-controller calls**

   In the out-of-process model, we cannot directly invoke controller-side functions from the JIT-compiled code running in the executor. This limitation made the previous mechanism unsuitable.


### Approach (Initial design — under review)

**Pull Request:** [#156649](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/156649)

We reimplemented the value-printing infrastructure on top of the ORC MemoryAccess API.The old design supported only in-process evaluation; the new design works in both in-process and out-of-process environments.

### How it works

1. **Capturing the JIT Expression Result**

   With the new design, we adopted a different approach:we now take the address of the evaluated JIT expression result and pass it to a runtime call.



   ```cpp
   EXTERN_C void __clang_Interpreter_SendResultValue(void *Ctx, unsigned long long, void *);// In-process: Ctx is a pointer to the ValueResultManager object, // allowing us to call ValueResultManager::deliverResult.EXTERN_C void __orc_rt_SendResultValue(unsigned long long, void *);// Out-of-process version.
   ```



   At the AST level, we perform the necessary transformations to insert this runtime call.When adding the runtime “sugar” call to the expression AST, the expression must be an lvalue, so we can safely cast it to a `void*` and pass it to the runtime helper.

   If the expression is already an lvalue, we simply cast and pass its address directly.If it’s an rvalue, we modify the AST to convert it into an lvalue, ensuring it can be handled uniformly by the runtime call added to the expression AST.

2. **Tracking results via `ValueResultManager`**

   We introduced a new helper, `ValueResultManager`, which tracks upcoming expression results using a unique `Expr ID -&#62; TypeInfo` mapping.The expression’s runtime call includes this ID, which is later returned to the controller-side handler when the executor reports back.

   **Executor runtime call example:**



   ```cpp
   RC_RT_JIT_DISPATCH_TAG(__orc_rt_SendResultValue_tag)ORC_RT_INTERFACE void __orc_rt_SendResultValue(uint64_t ResultId, void *V) { Error OptErr = Error::success(); if (auto Err = WrapperFunction&#60;SPSError(uint64_t, SPSExecutorAddr)&#62;::call( JITDispatch(&#38;__orc_rt_SendResultValue_tag), OptErr, ResultId, ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(V))) { cantFail(std::move(OptErr)); cantFail(std::move(Err)); } consumeError(std::move(OptErr));}
   ```



   **Controller-side runtime call for in-process:**



   ```cpp
   REPL_EXTERNAL_VISIBILITY void__clang_Interpreter_SendResultValue(void *Ctx, uint64_t Id, void *Addr) { static_cast&#60;ValueResultManager *&#62;(Ctx)-&#62;deliverResult( [](llvm::Error Err) { llvm::cantFail(std::move(Err)); }, Id, llvm::orc::ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(Addr));}
   ```



   This mechanism allows both in-process and out-of-process environments to deliver evaluated result addresses to `ValueResultManager::deliverResult`.

3. **Reading and formatting values**

   On receiving the address, the `ValueResultManager` calls into a `ValueReaderDispatcher`, which uses **MemoryAccess** to read values from memory using the address and type information.The evaluated data is then wrapped in a redesigned `Value` class and finally converted to a string via a `ValueToString` printer.


### New `Value` class design

The new `Value` implementation is inspired by `APValue` and designed to handle both local and remote execution enviroment.

Key improvements:

- Supports array element store and access by index.
- Works safely in out-of-process mode — the old design, which assumed arrays lived in controller-side memory (invalid in remote execution).
- Provides a unified way to represent, store, and print evaluated results across environments.

### Other PRs

[166510](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/166510) [166147](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/166147)

## Future Work

The next step will be to continue development on the ORC-JIT side, aligned with the ongoing evolution of the Executor layer.Once the new Executor design stabilizes, we’ll revisit the Library-Resolution API and make any necessary adjustments for compatibility and cleaner integration.This work will be done under the guidance of Lang Hames, ensuring it fits well within the evolving ORC architecture.

The next phase of this project focuses on integrating the Library-Resolution API into ORC-JIT.Specifically, we plan to:

- **Introduce the AutoDylibResolver** — based on the groundwork implemented in the _ExecutorResolver_ pull request.This component will allow ORC-JIT to automatically invoke the Library-Resolution API whenever it encounters an unresolved symbol.

- **Enable automatic library loading** in ORC-JIT.Once integrated, ORC-JIT (and tools like `Clang-Repl`) will be able to automatically locate and load the required libraries during runtime — removing the need for users to manually load them.


This next step will complete the feature chain — from symbol detection to automatic library resolution and loading — making `Clang-Repl` more user-friendly.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we now have a working Library-Resolver API implementation in ORC-JIT.Moving forward, the focus will be on integrating this API into ORC-JIT to enable automatic library loading and further improve `Clang-Repl` and other projects that use ORC-JIT as their execution engine.

Thank you for being part of my GSoC 2025 journey!

&#62; Easy means you can add it to your system quickly. Simple means you can understand the work that you’ve done.

I like this framing.

Easy means you can do with little effort.

Simple means you can understand what you do with little effort.

In other words: easy measures the effort in doing, while simple measures the effort in understanding the doing.

For example: `npm create framework@latest` or “Hey AI, build an instagram clone”. These both get you a website with little effort (easy) but do you understand what you just did (simple)?

[It’s easy to get complexity](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2016-11-18T1230), but it’s not easy to get simplicity.

(I get this is arguing semantics and definitions, but I find it to be a useful framing personally. Thanks Jake!)

I watched a video of a woman, a disabled army veteran, being dragged from her car by the ICEs, and hearing cop car sirens in the background, imagining, hoping -- they were coming to stop the attack.

        <![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed that I did a big design refresh on my entire site… unless you’re on RSS I guess. I’ll talk about aspects in detail, but at a high level there’s been three big changes:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>A monospace font</li>
        <li>Named CSS grid lines</li>
        <li>Juicier multi-page view transitions</li>
        </ol>
        <p>But my most favorite part is that today  (when you set <code>html { --hue-rotate: 15 }</code>), my light theme looks like a stick of butter. And that brings me joy.</p>
        <h2>What didn’t change</h2>
        <p>Before I talk about what changed, here’s a quick list of the parts of my site that didn’t change:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Same big “Dave” SVG on the homepage</li>
        <li>Same information architecture, no radical content changes.</li>
        <li>No new assets, same visuals.</li>
        <li>Same <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/01/color-hue-rotating-gaslight/">hue-rotating background</a>, although I did simplify the formula.</li>
        <li>Same <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/06/fittext-too-attr-boogaloo/">inverse text-sizing</a> for H1s</li>
        <li>Same <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/01/art-direction-for-static-sites/">support for art-directed posts</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why change the parts you’re happy with, eh? Knowing what you want to change versus what you don’t want to change makes the whole process go faster.</p>
        <h2>All-in on a monospace font</h2>
        <p>My type system always falls apart. I start with a good setup and I’m guaranteed to ruin it over time. Whenever I read a site with a nice typeface and reasonable CPL, I started to feel like my <code>system-ui</code> based body text styles were letting me down. It didn’t feel cozy.</p>
        <p>Then I saw <a href="https://robinrendle.com/">Robin Rendle</a>’s latest redesign (which is wonderful, btw) I wondered… Could I be a <code>monospace</code> font guy? Is that me? Do I identify as that? Is it too emo? Does it come off as a bad developer pun like <code>bleep blorp I'm a programmer and using a computer bleep blorp</code>?</p>
        <p>All good questions to ask myself and exposes some insecurity I have, but I couldn’t shake the idea so I went for it.</p>
        <p>The entire site is now set in <code>Cascadia Mono</code> which is a variant of Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-mono">Cascadia Code</a>. That decision is unintentionally on-brand for my current stage of life. Initially I wanted to use <a href="https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> by Raph Levien, but it didn’t have a “numero” (№) symbol – which is a common missing glyph in a lot of indie fonts – and is an unfortunate piece of critical typographical infrastructure with my <a href="https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck">vibechecks</a>.</p>
        <p>In general I love the change. It feels very “me” right now. I worry about the readability of monospace fonts some, but I don’t think I was winning the Legibility Wars before.</p>
        <h2>Naming my grid lines</h2>
        <p>Improving the grid on my site is something I’ve wanted to do for nearly two years. The max-width container I had was fine before, but I relied a lot on <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/03/full-bleed-with-not/">margin overrides</a> to change a container that <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/03/thoughts-on-negative-margins/">felt like a hack</a> that in my experience don’t scale.</p>
        <p>Now I have something better with some sweet tech from <a href="https://smolcss.dev/#smol-breakout-grid">Stephanie Eckles</a> that I saw on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw">Kevin Powell’s YouTube</a> called “Named Grid Lines”. A not-so-well-known feature of grid is you can name the gutters in your grid template. The result is a grid that looks like this:</p>
        <grid-container-demo>
          <div class="full">Full</div>
          <div class="margin">Margin</div>
          <div class="wide">Wide</div>
          <div class="outdent">Outdent</div>
          <div>Content (Default)</div>
        </grid-container-demo>
        <p>See how all the grids collapse into one line that’s offset from the edge? That’s what I want. And then to use it, you specify the <code>*-start</code> and <code>*-end</code> line you tweak your container with a modifier class and make all the children start at a different grid line.</p>
        <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nc">.foo.container</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        	<span class="nl">grid-column</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">wide-start</span> <span class="p">/</span> <span class="n">wide-end</span><span class="p">;</span> 
          <span class="c">/* or grid-column: wide */</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        </code></pre></div></div>
        <p>This gives me a lot of scalable control for my layout at the template level. For example, the layout of my homepage looks like this:</p>
        <grid-container-demo>
          <div class="outdent">Header</div>
          <div class="outdent">Logo</div>
          <div>Latest Posts</div>
          <div>Projects</div>
          <div class="outdent">Footer</div>
        </grid-container-demo>
        <p>But when you click through to a single post, the template shifts to this:</p>
        <grid-container-demo>
          <div class="outdent">Header</div>
          <div class="outdent-end">Title Goes Here</div>
          <div>Content</div>
          <div class="outdent-end">Media</div>
          <div>Content</div>
            <div>Content</div>
          <div class="outdent-end">Media</div>
            <div>Content</div>
            <div>Content</div>
          <div class="outdent">Footer</div>
        </grid-container-demo>
        <p>I don’t have this setup, but I could write out a system of utility classes to make all this super flexible.</p>
        <grid-container-demo>
          <div class="full-start">.full-start</div>
          <div class="margin-start">.margin-start</div>
          <div class="wide-start">.wide-start</div>
          <div class="outdent-start">.outdent-start</div>
          <div>Default Content</div>
          <div class="outdent-end">.outdent-end</div>
          <div class="wide-end">.wide-end</div>
          <div class="margin-end">.margin-end</div>
          <div class="full-end">.full-end</div>
        </grid-container-demo>
        <p>That’s a lot of different layouts to craft. I look forward to more sustainable art direction for years to come. No more hacky negative margins or fixed positioned items… right?</p>
        <h2>More Multipage View Transitions</h2>
        <p>I’ve had <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/05/getting-started-view-transitions/">multi-page view transitions on my site</a> for years now. The original was a title transition from the index template to the post template where the post title would do a subtle swoop up and morph from an <code>H3</code> to display-sized <code>H1</code>. This was great until I changed the font for my <code>H1</code> (see above) and I obliterated the slight of hand magic I had before. Oops.</p>
        <p>Now the flagship animation on my site is not typography dependent. If you navigate through my site, you’ll see that the “Dave” SVG on the homepage transitions into the main navigation on subpages. As a bonus, I get a little bit of much-needed branding on subpages. I didn’t do anything special other than naming the view transition and beefing up the stroke when the logo is in its smaller form.</p>
        <p>The main nav is out-dented a bit by default, but using my new named columns I made the navigation go wider to match wide pages like my Bookshelf. Flexbox’s <code>justify-content: space-between</code> and view-transitions is doing all the heavy lifting on that animation there but I’m pleased with the effect and it feels natural (aka not synthetic and cheap).</p>
        <p>I’m not a motion expert like <a href="https://cydstumpel.nl/">Cyd Stumpel</a>, but it feels good to have big, bold, un-ignorable view transitions on my site.</p>
        <h2>Slimmed down CSS</h2>
        <p>A redesign is always a great opportunity to clean house. I did the thing where I deleted my entire CSS and started from a naked page. Bit-by-bit I pulled back in the pieces I still needed.</p>
        <p>I have about 40% less CSS which manifests in ~150 less lines of code to maintain and up to <code>~0.8 KB</code> when compressed over the wire.</p>
        <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>LoC</th>
        <th>Raw</th>
        <th>Min+Gzip</th>
        <th>Min+Brotli</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td>Before</td>
        <td>557</td>
        <td>10.3 KB</td>
        <td>2.76 KB</td>
        <td>2.43 KB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>After</td>
        <td>391</td>
        <td>5.36 KB</td>
        <td>1.97 KB</td>
        <td>1.76 KB</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Now <code>0.8 KB</code> isn’t much but because I inline my critical CSS the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on every page, this number matters. My entire homepage document is <code>~5.5 KB</code> (Brotli), so that’s a 10%~20% performance improvement from cleaning up my CSS. How did I get these gains, you ask? Well…</p>
        <p>One reason my CSS smaller is because I’m using modern CSS (nesting, <code>:has()</code>, <code>:is()</code>, <code>:where()</code>, <code>:not()</code>, etc). Those features seem like minor syntactic sugar but you also get more efficient selectors. For example my out-denting that I do in posts would previous be something like:</p>
        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.post iframe, 
        .post video, 
        .post img,
        .post table { }
        </code></pre></div></div>
        <p>In modern CSS that super-conjoined selector becomes something more expressive and elegant:</p>
        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.post :is(iframe, video, img, table) {}
        </code></pre></div></div>
        <p>Those small improvements add up, but another reason the CSS is smaller is because its doing a lot less. Other than my inverse-sized H1s in posts, I’m not managing type styles at all beyond setting the body font-size. I think this is what Andy Bell calls “<a href="https://bell.bz/be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager/">Be the Browser’s Mentor, Not Its Micromanager</a>”. My strategy here is: Don’t futz with it until you can think of something way better than what the browser already does. That seems very <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao</a> or <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">Web’s Grain’y</a>.</p>
        <h2>Onward to more art direction!</h2>
        <p>This redesign opens up a bright future for my site. I’ve already started on some of this work, but I’ll share that in a future post. I mentioned above but the named grid lines alone give me a lot of easy-to-use levers for expression. I touched up some <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/04/oh-the-paywalls-you-ll-meet/">old art-directed posts</a> and they are benefitting from the changes already.</p>
        <p>“Make it easy to play” seems like a good ethos for a personal site and I feel like I have that in the current manifestation.</p>]]>
      </description>
      <source:markdown>You might have noticed that I did a big design refresh on my entire site… unless you’re on RSS I guess. I’ll talk about aspects in detail, but at a high level there’s been three big changes:

1. A monospace font
2. Named CSS grid lines
3. Juicier multi-page view transitions

But my most favorite part is that today (when you set `html { --hue-rotate: 15 }`), my light theme looks like a stick of butter. And that brings me joy.

## What didn’t change

Before I talk about what changed, here’s a quick list of the parts of my site that didn’t change:

- Same big “Dave” SVG on the homepage
- Same information architecture, no radical content changes.
- No new assets, same visuals.
- Same [hue-rotating background](https://daverupert.com/2025/01/color-hue-rotating-gaslight/), although I did simplify the formula.
- Same [inverse text-sizing](https://daverupert.com/2025/06/fittext-too-attr-boogaloo/) for H1s
- Same [support for art-directed posts](https://daverupert.com/2021/01/art-direction-for-static-sites/)

Why change the parts you’re happy with, eh? Knowing what you want to change versus what you don’t want to change makes the whole process go faster.

## All-in on a monospace font

My type system always falls apart. I start with a good setup and I’m guaranteed to ruin it over time. Whenever I read a site with a nice typeface and reasonable CPL, I started to feel like my `system-ui` based body text styles were letting me down. It didn’t feel cozy.

Then I saw [Robin Rendle](https://robinrendle.com/)’s latest redesign (which is wonderful, btw) I wondered… Could I be a `monospace` font guy? Is that me? Do I identify as that? Is it too emo? Does it come off as a bad developer pun like `bleep blorp I&#39;m a programmer and using a computer bleep blorp`?

All good questions to ask myself and exposes some insecurity I have, but I couldn’t shake the idea so I went for it.

The entire site is now set in `Cascadia Mono` which is a variant of Microsoft’s [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-mono). That decision is unintentionally on-brand for my current stage of life. Initially I wanted to use [Inconsolata](https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) by Raph Levien, but it didn’t have a “numero” (№) symbol – which is a common missing glyph in a lot of indie fonts – and is an unfortunate piece of critical typographical infrastructure with my [vibechecks](https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck).

In general I love the change. It feels very “me” right now. I worry about the readability of monospace fonts some, but I don’t think I was winning the Legibility Wars before.

## Naming my grid lines

Improving the grid on my site is something I’ve wanted to do for nearly two years. The max-width container I had was fine before, but I relied a lot on [margin overrides](https://daverupert.com/2017/03/full-bleed-with-not/) to change a container that [felt like a hack](https://daverupert.com/2017/03/thoughts-on-negative-margins/) that in my experience don’t scale.

Now I have something better with some sweet tech from [Stephanie Eckles](https://smolcss.dev/#smol-breakout-grid) that I saw on [Kevin Powell’s YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw) called “Named Grid Lines”. A not-so-well-known feature of grid is you can name the gutters in your grid template. The result is a grid that looks like this:

Full

Margin

Wide

Outdent

Content (Default)

See how all the grids collapse into one line that’s offset from the edge? That’s what I want. And then to use it, you specify the `*-start` and `*-end` line you tweak your container with a modifier class and make all the children start at a different grid line.

```
.foo.container &#62; * {
	grid-column: wide-start / wide-end;
  /* or grid-column: wide */
}

```

This gives me a lot of scalable control for my layout at the template level. For example, the layout of my homepage looks like this:

Header

Logo

Latest Posts

Projects

Footer

But when you click through to a single post, the template shifts to this:

Header

Title Goes Here

Content

Media

Content

Content

Media

Content

Content

Footer

I don’t have this setup, but I could write out a system of utility classes to make all this super flexible.

.full-start

.margin-start

.wide-start

.outdent-start

Default Content

.outdent-end

.wide-end

.margin-end

.full-end

That’s a lot of different layouts to craft. I look forward to more sustainable art direction for years to come. No more hacky negative margins or fixed positioned items… right?

## More Multipage View Transitions

I’ve had [multi-page view transitions on my site](https://daverupert.com/2023/05/getting-started-view-transitions/) for years now. The original was a title transition from the index template to the post template where the post title would do a subtle swoop up and morph from an `H3` to display-sized `H1`. This was great until I changed the font for my `H1` (see above) and I obliterated the slight of hand magic I had before. Oops.

Now the flagship animation on my site is not typography dependent. If you navigate through my site, you’ll see that the “Dave” SVG on the homepage transitions into the main navigation on subpages. As a bonus, I get a little bit of much-needed branding on subpages. I didn’t do anything special other than naming the view transition and beefing up the stroke when the logo is in its smaller form.

The main nav is out-dented a bit by default, but using my new named columns I made the navigation go wider to match wide pages like my Bookshelf. Flexbox’s `justify-content: space-between` and view-transitions is doing all the heavy lifting on that animation there but I’m pleased with the effect and it feels natural (aka not synthetic and cheap).

I’m not a motion expert like [Cyd Stumpel](https://cydstumpel.nl/), but it feels good to have big, bold, un-ignorable view transitions on my site.

## Slimmed down CSS

A redesign is always a great opportunity to clean house. I did the thing where I deleted my entire CSS and started from a naked page. Bit-by-bit I pulled back in the pieces I still needed.

I have about 40% less CSS which manifests in ~150 less lines of code to maintain and up to `~0.8 KB` when compressed over the wire.

LoCRawMin+GzipMin+BrotliBefore55710.3 KB2.76 KB2.43 KBAfter3915.36 KB1.97 KB1.76 KB

Now `0.8 KB` isn’t much but because I inline my critical CSS the `&#60;head&#62;` on every page, this number matters. My entire homepage document is `~5.5 KB` (Brotli), so that’s a 10%~20% performance improvement from cleaning up my CSS. How did I get these gains, you ask? Well…

One reason my CSS smaller is because I’m using modern CSS (nesting, `:has()`, `:is()`, `:where()`, `:not()`, etc). Those features seem like minor syntactic sugar but you also get more efficient selectors. For example my out-denting that I do in posts would previous be something like:

```
.post iframe,
.post video,
.post img,
.post table { }

```

In modern CSS that super-conjoined selector becomes something more expressive and elegant:

```
.post :is(iframe, video, img, table) {}

```

Those small improvements add up, but another reason the CSS is smaller is because its doing a lot less. Other than my inverse-sized H1s in posts, I’m not managing type styles at all beyond setting the body font-size. I think this is what Andy Bell calls “ [Be the Browser’s Mentor, Not Its Micromanager](https://bell.bz/be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager/)”. My strategy here is: Don’t futz with it until you can think of something way better than what the browser already does. That seems very [Dao](https://alistapart.com/article/dao/) or [Web’s Grain’y](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/).

## Onward to more art direction!

This redesign opens up a bright future for my site. I’ve already started on some of this work, but I’ll share that in a future post. I mentioned above but the named grid lines alone give me a lot of easy-to-use levers for expression. I touched up some [old art-directed posts](https://daverupert.com/2020/04/oh-the-paywalls-you-ll-meet/) and they are benefitting from the changes already.

“Make it easy to play” seems like a good ethos for a personal site and I feel like I have that in the current manifestation.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>The `datalist` element is all fucked up on iOS. [Again](https://adactio.com/journal/21445).

I haven’t “upgraded” my iPhone to iOS 26 and I have no plans to. The whole Liquid Glass thing is literally offputting. So I wouldn’t have known about the latest regression in Safari if a friend hadn’t texted me about the problem.

He was trying to do a search on [The Session](https://thesession.org/). He was looking for the tune, The Road To Town. He started typing this into the form on the home page of the site.

![A screenshot of The Session on an iPhone during a search on the homepage. The search input is completely obscured by the text: The Road To Lisdoonvarna.](https://adactio.com/images/ios26-datalist.png)

This is incredibly annoying and seems to be a pattern of behaviour for Safari. Features are supported …technically. But the implementation is so buggy as to be unusable.

I’ll probably have to do some user-agent sniffing, which I hate. And it won’t be enough to just sniff for Safari on iOS 26. Remember that every browser on iOS is just Webkit in a trenchcoat.

Time to file a bug and then wait God knows how long for an update to get rolled out.

**Update**: [I filed a bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=305719), but in the meantime it looks like [user-agent sniffing is going to be impossible](https://nielsleenheer.com/articles/2025/the-user-agent-string-of-safari-on-ios-26-and-macos-26/).</source:markdown>

        It isn’t a strict recipe but more of a loose framework that can be

## 🔖 [How To\ Start a Permacomputing Collective](https://brewing.permacomputing.net/)

This is a guide brewed from conversations with initiatives in London
(UK), Berlin (DE), Prague (CZ), Philadelphia (USA), Rotterdam (NL),
Vienna (AT), Lutruwtia (Tas/AU), County Mayo (IE) and a community from
Middle America gathering on servers. This text can support you when
starting a permacomputing collective. We use fermenting as a metaphor.
It isn’t a strict recipe but more of a loose framework that can be
freely modified to suit local tastes and conditions. Many actions are
cyclical and can be seen as opportunities to revisit or re-purpose
later.

## 🔖 [Bookcorner](https://www.libraryfriends.info/bookcorner)

located at 311 North 20th Street (at Wood Street), one block north of
the Ben Franklin Parkway, directly behind the Central Library on Logan
Square and just five minutes from Routes 95 and 76 - is a used bookstore
staffed by a team of paid and volunteer booksellers that offers gently
used, publicly donated books, records, CDs at reduced prices. Now the
new home of Chris’ Kids Corner for children’s books and story hours,
they also feature an eclectic stock of fiction, non-fiction,
contemporary, classics, out of print, first editions, art, architecture
and crafts.

## 🔖 [Comment le discours médiatique sur l’IA empêche d’envisager d’autres\ possibles](https://theconversation.com/comment-le-discours-mediatique-sur-lia-empeche-denvisager-dautres-possibles-211766)

Le Sommet pour l’action sur l’intelligence artificielle se tient à Paris
du 6 au 11 février 2025. C’est l’occasion de rappeler l’existence d’une
boîte à outils pour révéler les angles morts des discours sur le
numérique. Autour du concept d’« impensé numérique », ces outils de
compréhension sont précieux pour garder la tête froide face à
l’irruption de l’IA générative dans notre quotidien.

## 🔖 [Our new report: AI code creates 1.7x more problems](https://www.coderabbit.ai/blog/state-of-ai-vs-human-code-generation-report)

We analyzed 470 open-source GitHub pull requests, including 320
AI-co-authored PRs and 150 human-only PRs, using CodeRabbit’s structured
issue taxonomy. Every finding was normalized to issues per 100 PRs and
we used statistical rate ratios to compare how often different types of
problems appeared in each group.

The results? Clear, measurable, and consistent with what many developers
have been feeling intuitively: AI accelerates output, but it also
amplifies certain categories of mistakes.

Father Mother Sister Brother is a 2025 comedy-drama anthology film
written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. It follows three estranged family
relationships in three different countries around the world, starring an

Columnar storage formats are the foundation for modern data analytics
systems. The proliferation of open- source file formats (i.e., Parquet,
ORC) allows seamless data sharing across disparate platforms. However,
these formats were created over a decade ago for hardware and workload
environments that are much different from today. Although these formats
have incorporated some updates to their specification to adapt to these
changes, not all deployments support those modifications, and too often
systems cannot overcome the formats’ deficiencies and limitations
without a rewrite. In this paper, we present the F uture-proof F ile
Format (F3) project. It is a next-generation open-source file format
with interoperability, extensibility, and efficiency as its core design
principles. F3 obviates the need to create a new format every time a
shift occurs in data processing and computing by providing a data
organization structure and a general-purpose API to allow developers to
add new encoding schemes easily. Each self-describing F3 file includes
both the data and meta-data, as well as WebAssembly (Wasm) binaries to
decode the data. Embedding the decoders in each file requires minimal
storage (kilobytes) and ensures compatibility on any platform in case
native decoders are unavailable. To evaluate F3, we compared it against
legacy and state-of-the-art open-source file formats. Our evaluations
demonstrate the efficacy of F3’s storage layout and the benefits of
Wasm-driven decoding.

## 🔖 [AI-centered conservation efforts can only be ethical if Indigenous\ people help lead them (commentary)](https://news.mongabay.com/2026/01/ai-centered-conservation-efforts-can-only-be-ethical-if-indigenous-people-help-lead-them-commentary/)

We are part of a growing global effort to ensure innovative technologies
serve Indigenous communities and their environmental priorities. As AI
rapidly becomes even more ubiquitous, Western science should look to
Indigenous experts to guide the development of ethical AI tools for
conservation in ways that assert their own goals, priorities and
cautions.

Responsible AI that benefits Indigenous communities and conservation
must implement Indigenous data sovereignty principles, and determine how
and if Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge should be
incorporated into these systems. AI that is co-designed with Indigenous
partners, rather than for them, can make these technologies more
accessible, culturally appropriate and aligned with community goals

## 🔖 [\#DataBack Vol 2: Truth Before “Indigenous AI”](https://animikii.com/databack/understanding-and-resisting-generative-ai)

A critical review of Generative AI for Indigenous-focused organizations,
governments, and anyone who wants to better understand and protect their
rights and privacy.

Tramas is an action-oriented research project of the Decolonial Feminist
Coalition for Digital and Environmental Justice. By examining case
studies and testimonies of resistance across Latin America, we aim to
show how the digital technology production chain has a wide range of
socio-environmental impacts on communities and their territories.

## 🔖 [The rise (and future fall) of Discord](https://slugcat.systems/post/24-12-12-the-rise-and-future-fall-of-discord/)

All the “Discord-only” communities that currently exist will likely
disappear, however. And unlike all the dead phpBB forums that nobody
uses anymore but are still up for now, dead Discord communities will
never appear on the Wayback Machine. A decade or more of the internet’s
history gone. Sure, you can’t easily google search the Wayback Machine,
but at least it still exists somewhere. Discords? Truly lost forever.
Entire hobby communities that spent years of work discussing things,
answering questions, a wealth of information… gone.

## 🔖 [Why spirituality is central to Indigenous mathematics](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-23-ideas/clip/16188784)

Indigenous math isn’t just about numbers and equations, it involves
culture, spirituality and more. Math professor Edward Doolittle, a
Mohawk from Six Nations in Ontario, sees math as something embedded in
Creation itself. In his Hagey Lecture at the University of Waterloo, he
describes Indigenous mathematics as being grounded in cognition,
emotion, the physical world and community. Indigenizing math, Doolittle
hopes, will make it more approachable and meaningful to Indigenous
students — show them how entwined it is with everyday life and something
much bigger than ourselves

## 🔖 [The Man Who Knew Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Knew_Infinity)

The Man Who Knew Infinity is a 2015 British biographical drama film
about the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, based on the 1991
book of the same name by Robert Kanigel.

## 🔖 [When AI writes almost all code, what happens to software engineering?](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what)

While AI is undeniably good at writing code, it remains poor at
architecting maintainable, distributable, and scalable systems. This is
where non-technical leaders who think they can fire their development
teams are making a significant mistake. Until we see the arrival of an
artificial intelligence that renders this entire discussion moot,
believing that technical expertise can be replaced by a prompt is a
strategic error. Building robust software still requires a human who
understands the underlying principles of the craft.

## 🔖 [Column Storage for the AI Era](https://sympathetic.ink/2025/12/11/Column-Storage-for-the-AI-era.html)

Now we are faced with the conundrum of figuring out which ones will
manage to reach broad adoption in the ecosystem. From where I’m standing
it seems easier to contribute the missing bits to Parquet and build
those systems on top. These formats prove that these techniques work. We
can get much better performance by applying new approaches. As a
community, we should take a hint and evolve what we have

## 🔖 [whenwords: An Open Source Library Without Code](https://github.com/dbreunig/whenwords)

But like said: the whenwords library contains no code. Instead,
whenwords contains specs and tests, specifically:

SPEC.md: A detailed description of how the library should behave and how
it should be implemented. tests.yaml: A list of language-agnostic test
cases, defined as input/output pairs, that any implementation must pass.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links The world needs an Ireland for disenshittification: Regulatory arbitrage isn't just for tax cheats. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: "Fledgling"; Magnetic forest rings; Electable Mr Sanders; "Terrorists" were just blind guys. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The world needs an Ireland for disenshittification (permalink) Ireland is a tax haven. In the 1970s and 1980s, life in the civil-war wracked country was hard &#8211; between poverty, scarce employment and civil unrest, the country hemorrhaged its best and brightest. As the saying went, "Ireland's top export is the Irish." In desperation, Ireland's political class hit on a wild gambit: they would weaponize Ireland's sovereignty in service to corporate tax evasion. Companies that pretended to establish their headquarters in Ireland would be able to hoard their profits, evading their tax obligations to every other country in the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_as_a_tax_haven A single country &#8211; poor, small, at the literal periphery of a continent &#8211; was able to foundationally transform the global order. Any company that has enough money to pretend to be Irish can avoid 25-35% in tax, giving it an unbeatable edge against competitors that lack the multinational's superpower of magicking all its profits into a state of untaxable grace somewhere over the Irish Sea. The effect this had on Ireland is&#8230;mixed. The Irish state is thoroughly captured by the corporations that pretend to call Ireland home. Anything those corporations want, Ireland must deliver, lest the footloose companies up sticks and start pretending to be Cypriot, Luxembourgeois, Maltese or Dutch. This is why Europe's landmark privacy law, the GDPR, has had no effect on America's tech giants. They pretend to be Irish, and Ireland lets them get away with breaking European law. The Irish state even hires these companies' executives to regulate their erstwhile employers: https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta But there is no denying that Ireland has managed to turn the world's taxable trillions into its own domestic billions. The fact that Ireland is cashing out less than 1% of what it's costing everyone else is terrible for the world's tax systems and competitive markets, but it's been a massive windfall for Ireland, and has lifted the country out of its centuries of colonial poverty and privation. There are many lessons to be learned from Ireland's experiment with regulatory arbitrage, but one is unequivocal: even a small, poor, disintegrating nation can change the world system by offering a site where you can do things that you can't do anywhere else, and if it does, that poor nation can grow wealthy and comfortable. What's more, there are plenty of "things that you can't do anywhere else" that are very good. It's not just corporate tax evasion. First among these things that you can't do anywhere else: it's a crime in virtually every country on earth to modify America's defective, enshittified, privacy-invading, money-stealing technology exports. That's because the US trade representative has spent the past 25 years using the threat of tariffs to bully all of America's trading partners into adopting "anti-circumvention" laws: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/#theories-of-change There is nothing good about this. The fact that local businesses can't sell you a privacy blocker, an alternative client, a diagnostic tool, a spare part, a consumable, or even software for your American-made devices leaves you defenseless before US tech's remorseless campaign of monetary and informational plunder &#8211; and it means that your economy is denied the benefits of creating and exporting these incredibly desirable, profitable products. Incredibly, Trump deliberately blew up this multi-trillion dollar system of US commercial advantage. By chaotically imposing and rescinding and re-imposing tariffs on the world, he has neutralized the US trade rep's tariff threats. Foreign firms just can't count on exporting to America anymore, so the threat of (more) tariffs grows less intimidating by the minute: https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations The time is ripe for the founding of a disenshittification nation, an Ireland for disenshittification. I have no doubt that eventually, most or all of the countries in the world will drop their anti-circumvention laws (the laws that ban the modification of US tech exports). Once one country starts making these disenshittifying tools, there'll be no way to prevent their export, since all it takes to buy one of these tools from a circumvention haven is an internet connection and a payment method. Once everyone in your country is buying and using jailbreaking tools from abroad, there'll be no point in keeping these laws on your own books. But the first country to get there stands a chance of establishing a durable first-mover advantage &#8211; of reaping hundreds of billions selling disenshittifying products around the world. That country could be to enshittification-resistant technology what Finland was to mobile phones during the Nokia decade (and wouldn't you know it, the EU's newly minted "Tech Sovereignty" czar is a Finn!): https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/henna-virkkunen_en The world has experimented with many kinds of havens over the centuries. In the early 18th century, Madagascar became a haven for British naval deserters, who were adopted into the island's matriarchal clans. Together, they founded an anarchist pirate utopia: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/24/zana-malata/#libertalia The global system of trade has allowed America's tech companies to steal and hoard trillions, and to put every country at risk of being bricked when their IT systems are switched off at a single word from Trump: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition There are more than 200 countries in the world. There's also an ever-expanding cohort of brilliant international technologists whose Silicon Valley dreams have turned into a nightmare of being shot in the face by an ICE goon, or being kidnapped, separated from their families and being locked up in a Salvadoran slave-labor prison. These techies are looking for the next place to put down roots and "make a dent in the universe." Lots of countries could be that place. The Ireland for disenshittification wouldn't just have their pick of international technologists &#8211; they'd have plenty of Americans hungering for a better life. Two-thirds of young Americans "are considering leaving the US": https://www.newsweek.com/nearly-two-thirds-of-young-americans-are-considering-leaving-the-us-11010814 Ireland pulled off its tax-haven gambit by making influential people very rich, so that they would go to bat for Ireland. The Ireland for disenshittification will have the same chance. The new tech companies that unlock US Big Tech's trillions and turn them into their own billions (with the remainder being shared by us, tech users, in the form of lower prices and better products) will be a powerful bloc in support of this project. Ireland showed us: it just takes one country to defect from this global prisoner's dilemma, and then everything is up for grabs.

In the 1970s and 1980s, life in the civil-war wracked country was hard – between poverty, scarce employment and civil unrest, the country hemorrhaged its best and brightest. As the saying went, &#34;Ireland&#39;s top export is the Irish.&#34; In desperation, Ireland&#39;s political class hit on a wild gambit: they would weaponize Ireland&#39;s sovereignty in service to corporate tax evasion.

        OpenAI's long-rumored introduction of ads to ChatGPT just became a whole lot more concrete:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In the coming weeks, we’re also planning to start testing ads in the U.S. for the free and Go tiers, so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay. Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads.</p>

        <p>What's "Go" tier, you might ask? That's a new $8/month tier that launched today in the USA, see <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/">Introducing ChatGPT Go, now available worldwide</a>. It's a tier that they first trialed in India in August 2025 (here's a mention <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes#h_22cae6eb9f">in their release notes from August</a> listing a price of ₹399/month, which converts to around $4.40).</p>
        <p>I'm finding the new plan comparison grid on <a href="https://chatgpt.com/pricing">chatgpt.com/pricing</a> pretty confusing. It lists all accounts as having access to GPT-5.2 Thinking, but doesn't clarify the limits that the free and Go plans have to conform to. It also lists different context windows for the different plans - 16K for free, 32K for Go and Plus and 128K for Pro. I had assumed that the 400,000 token window <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5.2">on the GPT-5.2 model page</a> applied to ChatGPT as well, but apparently I was mistaken.</p>
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: I've apparently not been paying attention: here's the Internet Archive ChatGPT pricing page from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250906071408/https://chatgpt.com/pricing">September 2025</a> showing those context limit differences as well.</p>
        <p>Back to advertising: my biggest concern has always been whether ads will influence the output of the chat directly. OpenAI assure us that they will not:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Answer independence</strong>: Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you. Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you. Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversation privacy</strong>: We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers.</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>

      <title>Pluralistic: Catch this! (16 Jan 2026)</title>
      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/16/interrupt-driven/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links Catch this! Email is good, actually. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: LDS excommunication; King Foundation v "I Have a Dream"; "Lat-stage capitalism" v "Christ, what an asshole"; Pelosi v Porter. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Catch this! (permalink) Call it "lifehacking," or just call it, "paying attention to how you stay organized" &#8211; I don't care what you call it, I am an ardent practitioner of it. I like improving my processes because I like what I do, and the more efficient I am at all of it (with apologies to Jenny Odell), the more of that stuff I can get done: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/ I want to do a lot of stuff. I am one of those people who is ten miles wide and one inch deep (it probably has something to do with imbibing Heinlein's maxim that "specialization is for insects" at an impressionable age). There's a million waterways I want to dip my toe (or my oar) into, and the better organized I am, the more of that stuff I'll get to do before I kick off. I'm 54, and while there's a lot of road ahead of me, I can see the end, off there in the distance. It's coming, and I'm not done &#8211; I'm barely getting started. I've been around lifehacking since the very moment it was born. I was there. I published the notes on Danny O'Brien's seminal 2004 talk at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, "Life Hacks: Tech Secrets of Overprolific Alpha Geeks": https://craphound.com/lifehacksetcon04.txt In the years since, I've cultivated a small &#8211; but mighty &#8211; repertoire of organizational habits and tools that let me get a hell of a lot done. Weirdly, many of these tools are things that other people hate, and I can see why &#8211; they use them in very different ways from me. That's true of browser tabs (I loooove browser tabs): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/25/today-in-tabs/#unfucked-rota And to-do lists, which will totally transform your life, once you realize that the most important to-do list is the one you maintain for everyone else who owes you a response, a package, or money: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo Other essential tools languish in neglect, artifacts of the old, good web &#8211; the elegant weapons that dominated a more civilized age. First among these? RSS readers: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise I will freely stipulate that people have a good reason to hate all this stuff. "Productivity porn" is often proffered as a mix of humblebrag (a way to make other people jealous of your almighty "productivity") and denial (fiddling with your systems is a ready substitute for actually doing things). Many (most?) of the foremost self-appointed pitchmen for "lifehacking" are cringey charlatans peddling "courses" and other nonsense. But if you keep digging, there's a solid foundation beneath all the rot. At its very best, this stuff is a way to figure out what you really want to do, and to organize your life so that the stuff you want to do is the stuff you're doing. A lot of people get into this kind of thing thinking it'll let them do everything. No one can do everything. The best you can hope for is to make conscious decisions about which stuff you'll never get to, while leaving at least a little room for serendipity. Like I said, I want to do a lot of stuff. My organizing tactics are as much about deciding what I won't do as they are about deciding what I will do: https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-how-to-do-everything-lifehacking-considered-harmful/ Which brings me to another tool that everyone hates and I love: email. I live and die by email. First of all, I filter all my incoming email: mail from people who are in my address book stays in my inbox; mail from people I've never heard from before goes into a mailbox called "People I don't know." When I reply to a message, Thunderbird adds the recipient to my address book, so the next time I hear from them, they'll stay in my main mailbox. I also filter out anything containing the word "unsubscribe," sending it into a folder called "Unlikely" (but not if the message contains my name &#8211; which is how I can stay subscribed to mailing lists I don't have time to read and make sure to reply when someone mentions me). Second of all, I have a zillion Quicktext macros that I use to reply to frequently asked questions. I have one that spits out my mailing address; another that spits out my bio; and others for politely saying no to things I don't have time for, for information about how to pay one of my invoices, etc, etc. Third: I have a small folder of emails that I can't reply to right away (usually because I need some information from a third party), which I review every morning and answer anything that I can clear. Finally, I save it all. I have so much saved email, which means that if you ask me about something from 20 years ago, there's a good chance I can find it &#8211; provided we organized it over email. All of which explains why I refuse &#8211; to the extent that I can &#8211; to do anything important over instant messaging, whether that's Signal or any of the other messaging tools that come with social media, workplace software, etc. I understand why people like instant messaging: it does not overwhelm you with the burdens of the past. It is largely ahistorical, with archives that are hard to access and search. Its norms and register are less formal than email. And, of course, instant messaging is far superior to email in some contexts. If you're on vacation with friends, having a big group-chat where you can say, "I'm making dinner &#8211; is everyone OK with cheese?" is indispensable. Same goes for asking a friend for directions, announcing that you've arrived at someone's office, or confirming whether it's OK to substitute 2% for whole milk on a grocery run. But if you're like me &#8211; if you've figured out how to do as many of the things that matter to you as you can possibly squeeze in, then getting an IM mid-flow is like someone walking up to a juggler who's working on a live chainsaw, a bowling ball, and a machete and tossing him a watermelon while shouting, "Hey, catch this!" The problem is that if you are asking about something important, something that can't be instantaneously managed by the recipient, then they will have to drop everything they're doing and, at the very least, make a note to themselves to go back to your message later and deal with it. Instant messaging doesn't have an inbox with everything you've been sent. Of course, that's why people love it. But the fact that you can't see all the things other people are expecting you to answer doesn't mean that they aren't expecting it. It also doesn't mean that everything will be fine if you just ignore all those messages. Instant messaging is a great tool for managing something that everyone is doing at the same time. It's also a nice way to keep an ambient social flow of updates from people in a rocking groupchat. But IM is fundamentally unserious. It is antithetical to the project of making a conscious decision about what you won't do, so that you do as many of the things that matter to you before you get to the end of the road. A massive email inbox is intimidating, but switching to IMs doesn't make all the demands in the email go away. It just puts them out of sight until they either expire or explode. Far better to decide what balls you're going to drop than to have them knocked out of your hand by a fast-moving watermelon.

(permalink) Call it &#34;lifehacking,&#34; or just call it, &#34;paying attention to how you stay organized&#34; – I don&#39;t care what you call it, I am an ardent practitioner of it. I like improving my processes because I like what I do, and the more efficient I am at all of it (with apologies to Jenny Odell), the more of that stuff I can get done: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/ I want to do a lot of stuff. I am one of those people who is ten miles wide and one inch deep (it probably has something to do with imbibing Heinlein&#39;s maxim that &#34;specialization is for insects&#34; at an impressionable age). There&#39;s a million waterways I want to dip my toe (or my oar) into, and the better organized I am, the more of that stuff I&#39;ll get to do before I kick off. I&#39;m 54, and while there&#39;s a lot of road ahead of me, I can see the end, off there in the distance. It&#39;s coming, and I&#39;m not done – I&#39;m barely getting started. I&#39;ve been around lifehacking since the very moment it was born. I was there. I published the notes on Danny O&#39;Brien&#39;s seminal 2004 talk at the O&#39;Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, &#34;Life Hacks: Tech Secrets of Overprolific Alpha Geeks&#34;: https://craphound.com/lifehacksetcon04.txt In the years since, I&#39;ve cultivated a small – but mighty – repertoire of organizational habits and tools that let me get a hell of a lot done. Weirdly, many of these tools are things that other people hate, and I can see why – they use them in very different ways from me. That&#39;s true of browser tabs (I loooove browser tabs): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/25/today-in-tabs/#unfucked-rota And to-do lists, which will totally transform your life, once you realize that the most important to-do list is the one you maintain for everyone else who owes you a response, a package, or money: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo Other essential tools languish in neglect, artifacts of the old, good web – the elegant weapons that dominated a more civilized age. First among these? RSS readers: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise I will freely stipulate that people have a good reason to hate all this stuff. &#34;Productivity porn&#34; is often proffered as a mix of humblebrag (a way to make other people jealous of your almighty &#34;productivity&#34;) and denial (fiddling with your systems is a ready substitute for actually doing things). Many (most?) of the foremost self-appointed pitchmen for &#34;lifehacking&#34; are cringey charlatans peddling &#34;courses&#34; and other nonsense. But if you keep digging, there&#39;s a solid foundation beneath all the rot. At its very best, this stuff is a way to figure out what you really want to do, and to organize your life so that the stuff you want to do is the stuff you&#39;re doing. A lot of people get into this kind of thing thinking it&#39;ll let them do everything. No one can do everything. The best you can hope for is to make conscious decisions about which stuff you&#39;ll never get to, while leaving at least a little room for serendipity. Like I said, I want to do a lot of stuff. My organizing tactics are as much about deciding what I won&#39;t do as they are about deciding what I will do: https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-how-to-do-everything-lifehacking-considered-harmful/ Which brings me to another tool that everyone hates and I love: email. I live and die by email. First of all, I filter all my incoming email: mail from people who are in my address book stays in my inbox; mail from people I&#39;ve never heard from before goes into a mailbox called &#34;People I don&#39;t know.&#34; When I reply to a message, Thunderbird adds the recipient to my address book, so the next time I hear from them, they&#39;ll stay in my main mailbox. I also filter out anything containing the word &#34;unsubscribe,&#34; sending it into a folder called &#34;Unlikely&#34; (but not if the message contains my name – which is how I can stay subscribed to mailing lists I don&#39;t have time to read and make sure to reply when someone mentions me). Second of all, I have a zillion Quicktext macros that I use to reply to frequently asked questions. I have one that spits out my mailing address; another that spits out my bio; and others for politely saying no to things I don&#39;t have time for, for information about how to pay one of my invoices, etc, etc. Third: I have a small folder of emails that I can&#39;t reply to right away (usually because I need some information from a third party), which I review every morning and answer anything that I can clear. Finally, I save it all. I have so much saved email, which means that if you ask me about something from 20 years ago, there&#39;s a good chance I can find it – provided we organized it over email. All of which explains why I refuse – to the extent that I can – to do anything important over instant messaging, whether that&#39;s Signal or any of the other messaging tools that come with social media, workplace software, etc. I understand why people like instant messaging: it does not overwhelm you with the burdens of the past. It is largely ahistorical, with archives that are hard to access and search. Its norms and register are less formal than email. And, of course, instant messaging is far superior to email in some contexts. If you&#39;re on vacation with friends, having a big group-chat where you can say, &#34;I&#39;m making dinner – is everyone OK with cheese?&#34; is indispensable. Same goes for asking a friend for directions, announcing that you&#39;ve arrived at someone&#39;s office, or confirming whether it&#39;s OK to substitute 2% for whole milk on a grocery run. But if you&#39;re like me – if you&#39;ve figured out how to do as many of the things that matter to you as you can possibly squeeze in, then getting an IM mid-flow is like someone walking up to a juggler who&#39;s working on a live chainsaw, a bowling ball, and a machete and tossing him a watermelon while shouting, &#34;Hey, catch this!&#34; The problem is that if you are asking about something important, something that can&#39;t be instantaneously managed by the recipient, then they will have to drop everything they&#39;re doing and, at the very least, make a note to themselves to go back to your message later and deal with it. Instant messaging doesn&#39;t have an inbox with everything you&#39;ve been sent. Of course, that&#39;s why people love it. But the fact that you can&#39;t see all the things other people are expecting you to answer doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t expecting it. It also doesn&#39;t mean that everything will be fine if you just ignore all those messages. Instant messaging is a great tool for managing something that everyone is doing at the same time. It&#39;s also a nice way to keep an ambient social flow of updates from people in a rocking groupchat. But IM is fundamentally unserious. It is antithetical to the project of making a conscious decision about what you won&#39;t do, so that you do as many of the things that matter to you before you get to the end of the road. A massive email inbox is intimidating, but switching to IMs doesn&#39;t make all the demands in the email go away. It just puts them out of sight until they either expire or explode. Far better to decide what balls you&#39;re going to drop than to have them knocked out of your hand by a fast-moving watermelon.

        <![CDATA[<p><i>This is a continuation of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">piece</a> I wrote in August 2025.</i></p>
        <p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/thinkDifferentBillboard.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Yesterday I wrote a <a href="https://this.how/wordland/wordpressorg.opml">this.how doc</a> about getting WordLand to run on sites that don't run on WordPress.com or have Jetpack installed. What this means is that their sites are accessible through the fantastic wpcom API, and with that API I have been able to build a very nice writers' workspace for WordPress sites. I call the ones that are left out the WordPress.org sites, though I know that's not an entirely accurate way of describing it, but neither is "self-hosted sites" because you could have a hosting service that doesn't install Jetpack. WordPress could be used for things that are quite different from the way it's used today. Important point.  </p>
        <p>I sent links to that post to two people, and encouraged them to pass it along, as a way of starting a discussion -- how are we going to get WordLand running on those "other" sites. And we need names for lots of things, but first we have to get the software working the way we want it to, then the naming will be more obvious.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Herve has already written a <a href="https://herve.bzh/wordland-on-self-hosted-sites/">response</a> (as I asked him to). As always, very helpful. But I want to push back on the way he frames the project -- as if it's up to me to do this work, and that I dispute. It think it's up to us. WordLand isn't just a product, it's a challenge.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>To make WordPress a fantastic platform for developers who want to build on its ability to write and read and link together writing and reading on the freaking web. That's why it's so important to understand what the web is and what it's capabilities are. We've been missing some of the big stuff since the big silos took over. I want, before I hang up my hat, to fix that. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm going to outline here how we start, so it's documented so more people will see it too. </p>
        <ul>
        <li>I have written a package, MIT-licensed, with an awkward name for historic reasons called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">wpIdentity</a>. It started off as just a simple way to use WordPress identity with FeedLand because it made sense to do it a couple of years ago because Twitter was destroying the utility of their API, and we needed a new way to do identity. So I stopped everything and implemented both email identity and WordPress identity, or more specifically, wordpress.com identity. This leaves out all the wordpress sites that you can't log onto this way. Not a good situation, I don't like it because I want WordPress to be one large happy family of users and developers. So that's what I'm seeking to instigate here. </li>
        <li>Then wpIdentity grew and grew. At first it supported all the endpoints in the wpcom API, and made it possible to build WordLand, which itself <i>only communicates to WordPress via wpIdentity.</i>  And later when I needed user-specific storage that is not part of the WordPress API, I built a very nice little storage system, it's efficient, highly scalable, and (I think) well debugged. If you read my initial <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">Think Different</a> piece you'll see it gets a mention in <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a141421">this part</a>. Storage, we will find out, is the big missing piece in the web, has always been the missing piece, the thing that keeps us from having a real developer community of web apps. How do I know? Because I'm a freaking developer. I don't work at a company that can insulate me from this need. That's why I see this need and so many others don't.</li>
        <li>Now here's something else that's cool. I didn't stop with wpIdentity, I made a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">JavaScript function</a> that simplifies the wpcom interface for people writing browser-based JavaScript apps. It radically simplifies it. I didn't invent this way of doing it, someone at Facebook did, as far as I'm concerned. We may not like Facebook the company or the boss man, but they have employed some brilliant programmers over the years. I think this idea came from the developers of FriendFeed, but I could be wrong. What they did was take the interface code every app developer has to do, and made <i>that</i> the API. I remember when I first saw it in 2013, it blew me away. It took me a full month to build support for Twitter in my app, but it only two days to do it in Facebook. I did one of those for WordPress. It's part of wpIdentity. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">Here it is</a>. Please if you're a contributor to wordpress.org -- study that thing, because we're going to be working on that code -- together. This is where the "we" part of it starts. But there's more.</li>
        <li>You don't <i>have</i> to read the code of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">api2.js</a> to understand how it works, there's an even easier way to do it -- <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo">wpEditorDemo</a>. It's a simple browser-based editor that does what WordLand does, without all the flourish. Bare bones. Also MIT-licensed. Nothing but what's required. You can <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo?tab=readme-ov-file#demo">try it out</a> if you have one or more qualifying sites (either on wordpress.com or having Jetpack installed). The project we need to do is this -- <i>make wpEditDemo work on any WordPress site, no matter where it's hosted.</i>  And that's going to be done by extending api2.js. That's where the differences will be encapsulated, and above that level, in wpEditDemo and WordLand and all its competitors, nothing changes. This project may be complicated or simple, or somewhere inbetween, but imho this has to be done. And this is the first place I want to join the open source community for WordPress. After talking with Jon, I became optimistic about this happening sooner than later. </li>
        <li>I zoomed through all this and more with Jonathan on <a href="http://scripting.com/2026/01/13.html#a224042">Tuesday</a>. This is what I want to talk about at WordCamp Europe later this year (I have submitted an application). I wanted to show Jon and a few other people I met in Ottawa in October how the pieces fit together. But zooming is the right word, Jon was ahead of me at every step, he just understood what I was showing him. I was blown away -- because this had never happened before with the architecture I had built. Not because it's so complex, it isn't -- it's all about simplifying things, with lots of factoring, finding a repeating pattern and then locking it down in code, so no one has to ever worry about the complexity again. I think it was hard for people to see because they aren't expecting it. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's where I'm going to leave it for now. I suggest if you have a response or comment, please put it on your blog and send me a link. We're going to create new ways to link blog posts together, but for now we'll do it by hand. </p>
        <p>PS: Hat-tip to Matt Mullenweg for building WordPress, and for having the idea that Tumblr could be rebuilt on top of WordPress. When he announced they were going to do that I knew I was on the right track. We were thinking about WordPress the same way. </p>
        <p>PPS: If people have a hard time understanding how I could do this -- remember: 1. I've had a lot of time. 2. I understand WordPress at a deep level. 3. I'm good at building and selling APIs, I've been fairly successful at it. And even better, the WordPress community has been a very good caretaker of this work. They support a remarkable amount of it, and it all still works, and they often wonder why the rest of the world doesn't love it like they do. I feel the same damn way. ;-)</p>

      <source:markdown>_This is a continuation of a [piece](http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html) I wrote in August 2025._

![](https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/thinkDifferentBillboard.png)Yesterday I wrote a [this.how doc](https://this.how/wordland/wordpressorg.opml) about getting WordLand to run on sites that don&#39;t run on WordPress.com or have Jetpack installed. What this means is that their sites are accessible through the fantastic wpcom API, and with that API I have been able to build a very nice writers&#39; workspace for WordPress sites. I call the ones that are left out the WordPress.org sites, though I know that&#39;s not an entirely accurate way of describing it, but neither is &#34;self-hosted sites&#34; because you could have a hosting service that doesn&#39;t install Jetpack. WordPress could be used for things that are quite different from the way it&#39;s used today. Important point.

I sent links to that post to two people, and encouraged them to pass it along, as a way of starting a discussion -- how are we going to get WordLand running on those &#34;other&#34; sites. And we need names for lots of things, but first we have to get the software working the way we want it to, then the naming will be more obvious.

Jeremy Herve has already written a [response](https://herve.bzh/wordland-on-self-hosted-sites/) (as I asked him to). As always, very helpful. But I want to push back on the way he frames the project -- as if it&#39;s up to me to do this work, and that I dispute. It think it&#39;s up to us. WordLand isn&#39;t just a product, it&#39;s a challenge.

*   To make WordPress a fantastic platform for developers who want to build on its ability to write and read and link together writing and reading on the freaking web. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to understand what the web is and what it&#39;s capabilities are. We&#39;ve been missing some of the big stuff since the big silos took over.

      <source:markdown>**[Open Responses](https://www.openresponses.org/)**

This is the standardization effort I&#39;ve most wanted in the world of LLMs: a vendor-neutral specification for the JSON API that clients can use to talk to hosted LLMs.

Open Responses aims to provide exactly that as a documented standard, derived from OpenAI&#39;s Responses API.

I was hoping for one based on their older Chat Completions API since so many other products have cloned the already, but basing it on Responses does make sense since that API was designed with the feature of more recent models - such as reasoning traces - baked into the design.

What&#39;s certainly notable is the list of launch partners. OpenRouter alone means we can expect to be able to use this protocol with almost every existing model, and Hugging Face, LM Studio, vLLM, Ollama and Vercel cover a huge portion of the common tools used to serve models.

For protocols like this I really want to see a comprehensive, language-independent conformance test site. Open Responses has a subset of that - the official repository includes [src/lib/compliance-tests.ts](https://github.com/openresponses/openresponses/blob/d0f23437b27845d5c3d0abaf5cb5c4a702f26b05/src/lib/compliance-tests.ts) which can be used to exercise a server implementation, and is available as a React app [on the official site](https://www.openresponses.org/compliance) that can be pointed at any implementation served via CORS.

What&#39;s missing is the equivalent for clients. I plan to spin up my own client library for this in Python and I&#39;d really like to be able to run that against a conformance suite designed to check that my client correctly handles all of the details.

        <![CDATA[Today's links How the Light Gets In: The door is open a crack! Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Poitras v First Look; Aaronsw's "Against School"; I was investigated by the FBI. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. How the Light Gets In (permalink) Of all the tools that I use to maintain my equilibrium in these dark days, none is so important as remembering the distinction between happiness, optimism and hope. Happiness is self-explanatory &#8211; and fleeting. Even in the worst of times, there are moments of happiness &#8211; a delicious meal with friends, a beautiful sunrise, a stolen moment with your love. These are the things we chase, and rightly so. But happiness is always a goal, rarely a steady state. Optimism, on the other hand, is a toxin to be avoided. Optimism is a subgenre of fatalism, the belief that things will get better no matter what we do. It's just the obverse of pessimism. Both are ways of denying human agency. To be an optimist is to be a passenger of history, along for the ride, with no hope of changing its course. But hope? That's the stuff. Hope is the belief that if we change the world for the better, even by just a little, that we will ascend a gradient towards a better future, and as we rise up that curve, new terrain will be revealed to us that we couldn't see from our lower vantage-point. It's not necessary &#8211; or even possible &#8211; to see a course from here to the world you want to live in. You can get there in stepwise fashion, one beneficial change at a time: https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/03/hope-not-optimism/ These days, I am often unhappy, but I am filled with hope. A couple of weeks ago, I gave a speech, "The Post-American Internet," at the 39th Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition In that talk, I laid out the case for hope. So many of the worst aspects of modern life can be traced to our enshittified technology, from mass surveillance and totalitarian control to wage suppression and conspiratorial cults. This enshittified technology, in turn, is downstream of policy decisions made by politicians who were bullied into their positions by the US trade rep, who used the threat of tariffs to push for laws that protected the right of tech giants to plunder the world's money and data, by criminalizing competitors who disenshittified their products, leaving technology users defenseless. Trump's tariffs have effectively killed that threat. If you can't tell from day to day &#8211; let alone year to year &#8211; whether the US will accept your exports, you can't rely on exporting to the USA. What's more, generations of pro-oligarch policies have stripped America's bottom 90% of discretionary income, stagnating their wages and leaving them mired in health, education, and housing debt (even as the system finds ever more sadistic and depraved ways for arm-breakers to collect on that debt): https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/16/k-shaped-recovery/#disenshittification-nations This is terrible for Americans, but when life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla. With the decline of the US market for global exporters, there's finally political space to stop worrying about tariffs and reconsider anti-circumvention laws, to create "disenshittification nations" that stage raids on the most valuable lines of business of the most profitable companies in world history &#8211; Big Tech: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/13/not-sorry/#mere-billions People who dream of turning American tech trillions into their own billions are powerful allies in the fight against enshittification, but they're only one group that we can recruit to our side. There's another powerful bloc waiting in the wings: national security hawks. These people are rightly terrified that Trump will order his tech companies to switch off their governments, businesses and households, all of whom are dependent on US cloud-based administrative software for email, document creation and archiving, databases and mobile devices. Trump's tech companies could also brick any nation's mobile phones, medical devices, cars, and tractors. It's the same risk that China hawks warned of when it looked as though Huawei would provide all of the world's 5G infrastructure: allow companies that are absolutely beholden to an autocrat who is not restrained by the rule of law to permeate your society, and your society becomes a prisoner to the autocrat's whims and goodwill. A coalition of digital rights activists; investors and entrepreneurs; and national security hawks makes for a powerful bloc indeed. Each partner in the coalition can mobilize different constituencies and can influence different parts of the state. These are very different groups, and that's why this coalition is so exciting: this is a three-pronged assault on the hegemony of Big Tech. That's not to say that this will automatically happen. Nothing happens automatically. Fuck pessimism, and fuck optimism, too. Things happen because people do stuff: https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/17/against-the-great-forces-of-history/ That's where hope comes in. The door to a better technological future has been slammed shut and triple-locked for 25 years. Today, it is open a crack. A crack isn't much, but as Leonard Cohen taught us, "that's how the light gets in": https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-anthem-lyrics Understand: this isn't a bet on politicians discovering heretofore unsuspected wellsprings of courage or principle. This is a bet on politicians confronting unstoppable political will that corners them into doing the right thing. I understand why Europeans, Canadians and Britons might feel cynical about their political classes (to say nothing of Americans, of course). It has been decades since a political party delivered broad, structural change that improved the lives of everyday people. Instead, we've had generations of neoliberal austerity sadists, autocrats and corrupt dolts who've helped billionaires stripmine our civilization and set the world on fire. But politics have changed before, and they can change again (note that I didn't say they will change &#8211; just that they can, because we can change them). Society may feel deadlocked, but crises precipitate change. As I said in my Hamburg speech, the EU went from 15 years behind in their solar transition to ten years ahead, in just a few years, thanks to the energy crisis that slammed into the continent after Putin invaded Ukraine. Crises precipitate change. The fact that the EU pivoted so quickly away from fossil fuels to solar is nothing short of a miracle. Anyone who feels like their politicians would never buck Big Tech needs to explain how it came to pass that these politicians just told Big Oil to fuck off. The fossil fuel industry is losing. This is goddamned wild &#8211; indeed, their loss might just be locked in at this point, because fossil fuel and its applications (like internal combustion) are now more expensive and more impractical than the cleantech alternatives: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/02/there-goes-the-sun/#carbon-shifting Sure, it sucks that Trump has killed incentives to drive an EV and that the EU is dropping its goal for phasing out internal combustion engines, but given that EVs are faster, cheaper and better than conventional automobiles, the writing is on the wall for the IC fleet. That's the wild thing about better technology: people want it, and they get pissed off when they're told they can't have it. When the Texas legislature tried to pass a law requiring that power companies add a watt of fossil-fuel generation capacity for every watt of solar they brought online, Trump-voting farmers and ranchers from the deepest red parts of Texas (Texas!!) flooded town halls and hearings, demanding an end to "DEI for natural gas": https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/for-reality They won. Politics aren't just terrible today, they're in chaos. Crises precipitate change. After World War II, one of Britain's two parties, the Liberals (AKA "Whigs") imploded. With them out of the way, the Labour Party rose to power, with a transformative agenda backed by a mass movement, which created the British welfare state. Today, the British Conservative Party (AKA "Tories") are also imploding, and look set to be taken over by a fascist MAGA-alike party, Reform. As of a couple months ago, that seemed like very bad news, since Labour is also set to implode, thanks to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's austerity, authoritarianism, corruption and cowardice. For quite a while, it looked like when Starmer's Labour is totally wiped out in the next election, they would give way to Reform, plunging Britain into Hungarian- (or American)-style autocracy. But all that has changed. Today, the UK Greens have a new leader, Zack Polanski, who has dragged the Greens into an agenda that promises transformations as bold as the ones that remade the country under Clement Attlee's Labour government. Polanski is a fantastic campaigner, and he is committed to the same kind of grassroots co-governance with a mass movement that characterized Zohran Mamdani's historic NYC mayoral campaign. In other words, it seems like both of Britain's sclerotic mainstream parties will be wiped out in the next election, and the real fight in the UK is between two transformative upstart parties, one of which plans to spend billionaires' dark money to mobilize fascists yearning for ethnic cleansing; and the other wants a fair, prosperous and equitable society where we abolish billionaires, confront the climate emergency, and smash corporate power. In other words, the UK is heading into an election in which voters have a choice that's more meaningful than Coke vs Pepsi. Versions of this are playing out around the world. Anti-billionaire policies have surfaced time and again, everywhere, since the late 2010s: https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting None of this means that we will automatically win. I'm not asking you to be an optimist here, but I am demanding that you have hope. Hope is a discipline: it requires that you tirelessly seek out the best ways to climb up that gradient toward a better world, trusting that as you attain higher elevation, you will find new paths up that slope. The door is open a crack. Now isn't the time to complain that it isn't open wider &#8211; now's the time to throw your shoulder against it.

        <p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Longtime readers of the newsletter will recall that we usually send out a survey once a year in December or January. <strong>We’re not doing a formal reader survey this year like we’ve done in the past, but if you have any feedback for us, we’re all ears!</strong> (And we hope it goes without saying that we’re eager to hear from readers year-round.) You can just reply to this email with any and all thoughts! Thanks in advance!</p>
        <p>I’m sure like a lot of you, we’ve been horrified by ICE’s brutality and violence in Minnesota over the last few weeks.

## What We Enjoyed This Week

[**Sneezes, Ranked**](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/sneezes-ranked?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426) **by** [**Tiffany Harris**](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/tiffany-harris?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426) _(McSweeney’s)_ An impressively comprehensive taxonomy of sneezes. This is one of our favorite types of piece, the kind that makes you aware of something that you didn’t know you already knew. Each new type of sneeze will have you nodding your head thinking, “Right, of course, I know that kind of sneeze well.”

[**Attention Passengers: The Captain Has Turned on the Applause Sign**](https://www.pointsincase.com/articles/attention-passengers-the-captain-has-turned-on-the-applause-sign?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426) **by** [**Jackie Halldorsson**](https://www.pointsincase.com/author/jackie-halldorsson?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426) _(Points in Case)_ This is a really nice execution of a simple, silly idea. Jackie explores what other kinds of signs are on this plane, which is a fun move, but never gets too far away from the premise that the title promises.

[**Boy Detective**](https://wigleaf.com/202601boy.htm?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426) **by** [**Cameron Vanderwerf**](https://www.standmagazine.org/contributors/cameron-vanderwerf/2214?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426) _(Wigleaf)_ Not a traditional short humor piece, but we love the blend of silliness and poignancy, and also all the great boy detective specifics like “Hallie O&#39;Malley the Science Gal” and “Cranberry Caper.&#34; (And if you can’t get enough boy detective media, check out friend of the newsletter DC Pierson’s [**Mystery Team**](https://lionsgatelimited.com/products/mystery-team-vestron-collector-s-series-blu-ray%E2%84%A2-36?variant=43862902014063&#38;utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426), which just got its first Blu-ray release.)

## An Old Favorite

[**I&#39;m Your Yoga Instructor and I’m Hitting on Some Weirdly Specific Things About You During This Class**](https://www.pointsincase.com/articles/im-your-yoga-instructor-and-im-hitting-on-some-weirdly-specific-things-about-you-during-this-class?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426) **by** [**Jason Garramone**](https://www.pointsincase.com/author/jason-garramone?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426) _(Points in Case)_ There are lots of pieces about yoga classes (because there are a lot of things that can be weird about yoga classes), but Jason sets this one apart by using yoga class as a vehicle for the really great “weirdly specific” character details promised by the title.

## Other Humorous Writing News

This week we learned that Condé Nast let the trademark for Gourmet Magazine lapse, allowing a collective to swoop in and revive it as a [worker-owned publication](https://gourmetmagazine.net/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426). We don’t yet know how much humorous writing there will be in the new incarnation of Gourmet, but we’re big fans of food writing here at the newsletter, and we think that the new owners’ [piece about their philosophy and the state of the magazine industry](https://gourmetmagazine.net/gourmet-is-back/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-426) is very much worth reading.</source:markdown>

I [wrote about Sprites last week](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/9/sprites-dev/). Here&#39;s Thomas Ptacek from Fly with the insider details on how they work under the hood.

I like this framing of them as &#34;disposable computers&#34;:

&#62; Sprites are ball-point disposable computers. Whatever mark you mean to make, we’ve rigged it so you’re never more than a second or two away from having a Sprite to do it with.

I&#39;ve noticed that new Fly Machines can take a while (up to around a minute) to provision. Sprites solve that by keeping warm pools of unused machines in multiple regions, which is enabled by them all using the same container:

&#62; Now, today, under the hood, Sprites are still Fly Machines. But they all run from a standard container. Every physical worker knows exactly what container the next Sprite is going to start with, so it’s easy for us to keep pools of “empty” Sprites standing by. The result: a Sprite create doesn’t have any heavy lifting to do; it’s basically just doing the stuff we do when we start a Fly Machine.

The most interesting detail is how the persistence layer works. Sprites only charge you for data you have written that differs from the base image and provide ~300ms checkpointing and restores - it turns out that&#39;s power by a custom filesystem on top of S3-compatible storage coordinated by Litestream-replicated local SQLite metadata:

&#62; We still exploit NVMe, but not as the root of storage. Instead, it’s a read-through cache for a blob on object storage. S3-compatible object stores are the most trustworthy storage technology we have. I can feel my blood pressure dropping just typing the words “Sprites are backed by object storage.” \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; The Sprite storage stack is organized around the JuiceFS model (in fact, we currently use a very hacked-up JuiceFS, with a rewritten SQLite metadata backend). It works by splitting storage into data (“chunks”) and metadata (a map of where the “chunks” are). Data chunks live on object stores; metadata lives in fast local storage. In our case, that metadata store is [kept durable with Litestream](https://litestream.io). Nothing depends on local storage.

        On November 21<sup>st</sup> Bryce Elder posed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883"><i>Five questions from an ignorant no-coiner about the crypto crash</i></a>. Each of his five questions identified some interesting apparent anomalies.<br />
        <br />
        Below the fold I look into each of his questions, asking how anomalous its anomalies really were and whether they have persisted into the New Year.<br />
        <br />
        TL;DR none of them are really surprising but reaching that conclusion took a good deal of research.<br />
        <span><a name='more'></a></span>
        <br />
        <h3>Why doesn’t network difficulty fall?</h3>
        Elder explains Bitcoin's <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">difficulty mechanism</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm has a difficulty ratchet to keep production steady. Network difficulty adjusts every two weeks, approximately, based on whether miners have been finding new blocks for the blockchain too quickly or too slowly.<br />
        </blockquote>
        And then identifies the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">first anomaly</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Difficulty tightens when a higher bitcoin price is encouraging miners to join the market, that much makes sense. But when a lower bitcoin price is squeezing margins and pushing the least efficient miners out, shouldn’t difficulty fall?
        </blockquote>
        Here is the chart Elder is looking at.<br />

        Then <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">Elder asks</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Maybe difficulty lags behind the price? As said above, the ratchet only adjusts approximately every two weeks. Total hashrate oﬀers a more dynamic measure of power deployed to the network, albeit an estimated one based on how long it’s taking to mine a block. Any change in market structure might show up there first.<br />
        <br />
        And has it? Not really:
        </blockquote>
        The first thing to note is that, depending upon power costs and where they are in the queue for the latest rigs from Bitmain, miners margins vary greatly. So Elder is right that, if one of the two-week adjustemnts increases the difficulty, some of the least economic rigs should be switched off. In theory, if the adjustment decreases the difficulty, some of these idled rigs should be switched back on.<br />
        <br />
        Eyeballing the graph, between early July and late October the price was between $110K and $120K, a 9% range. During that period the difficulty increased from around 140trn to around 155trn, about an 11% range. These aren't big changes, but it appears a bit strange that roughly flat price coincides with a steady-ish increase in difficulty.<br />
        <br />
        Elder has some possible <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">explanations</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Do miners with sunk costs keep running on negative margins in the hope of getting lucky? Are a handful of big miners, maybe advantaged by free power or whatever, keeping difficulty high to drive out competitors, either inadvertently or as part of some devious plan to centralise production and control the network? Or has mining become 55 per cent more eﬃcient since last November?
        </blockquote>
        I estimate that during that time Bitmain and its competitors shipped an additional 1000EH/s to the miners, over and above the new rigs replacing obsolete ones. These leading-edge rigs would have been turned on immediately. During that time the hash rate rose from about 870EH/s to around 1120EH/s, or about 250EH/s. So around 150EH/s must have represented idled, less-efficient rigs being turned on. At the start of the period at most 85% of the rig fleet was working. At the end of the period, as the price started to fall, the most efficient miners had about 100EH/s more than they did at the beginning.<br />
        <br />
        In the subsequent 2 months the price dropped from about $120K to around $85K and the hash rate dropped from around 1120EH/s to around 1060EH/s, or by 60EH/s.  But in that time there ws an incremental 50EH/s of new rigs. So 110EH/s of the 150EH/s from the originally idle fleet of uneconomic rigs were turned off. This within the margin or error of my back-of-the-envelope estimates.<br />
        <br />
        My take is that what happened was what should have been expected. Elder's view was too simplistic, and he was misled by (a) the noise in the graph, and ((b) the fact that the Y axis doesn't start at zero, making the noise much more evident.<br />

        Elder goes on to note an issue I've been writing about for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">really a long time</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Related, is it a worry that just three mining pools accounted for more than 45 per cent of this week’s block production? Given nearly all the hardware used across the network is Chinese-made, with Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies alone having an estimated market share of 82 per cent, when do concentration levels among a few organisations become a security concern?
        </blockquote>
        Yes, this concentration has been a problem for Bitcoin's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/06/pseudonymity-and-cooperation.html">entire history</a>, but everyone has decided to ignore it. As I write, on 6<sup>th</sup> January 2026, over the last three days Foundry USA and AntPool have controlled 51.2% of the hash power.  As I explained at length in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/12/sabotaging-bitcoin.html"><i>Sabotaging Bitcoin</i></a>, there are practical difficulties facing an insider attack with 30% of the hash power, but with 51.2% things are much easier.<br />
        <br />
        And, in November, Reuters reports that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bitcoin-mining-china-rebounds-defying-2021-ban-2025-11-24/"><i>Bitcoin mining in China rebounds, defying 2021 ban</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Bitcoin mining is quietly staging a comeback in China despite being banned four years ago, as individual and corporate miners exploit cheap electricity and a data center boom in some energy-rich provinces, according to miners and industry data.<br />
        <br />
        China had been the world's biggest crypto mining country until Beijing banned all cryptocurrency trading and mining in 2021, citing threats to the country's financial stability and energy conservation.<br />
        <br />
        After having seen its global bitcoin mining market share slump to zero as a result of the ban, China crept back to third place with a 14% share at the end of October, according to Hashrate Index, which tracks bitcoin mining activities.
        </blockquote>
        This may be what the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/26/1113802/china-ai-data-centers-unused/">80% of new data centers</a> in China that were empty because unsuitable for AI are being used for.<br />

        <h3>What’s the deal with Tether?</h3>
        Zeke Faux described Tether as "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">practically quilted out of red flags</a>" and they are <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/the-red-flags-multiply-for-tether">still flapping</a>. What attracted Elder's attention <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">was this</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Stablecoins have long been pitched as crypto’s on-ramp. Swapping fiat money for a fiat-pegged stablecoin like Tether’s USDT or Circle’s USDC allows a trader to switch in and out of positions without having to touch tradfi.<br />
        <br />
        Shouldn’t an on-ramp also work as an off-ramp? There’s not much evidence it does. In the six weeks or so when $1.2tn in value was drawn down from the cryptoverse, the market cap of USDT has <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/">increased by approximately $20bn</a>:

        This USDT graph is updated from the one Elder used. It shows a clear break in the upward trend on 24<sup>th</sup> October.  In the 10 preceding weeks it increased by $17B (~10%) as Bitcoin traded beteween a low of $108K and a high on 6<sup>th</sup> October of almost $125K.<br />
        <br />
        In the 10 weeks since it has increased by only $3B as Bitcoin dropped from $111K to a low of $84K on 22<sup>nd</sup> November, subsequently trading in a range from there to $94K.<br />
        <br />
        The only other stablecoin that matters <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">is USDC</a>:<br />

        Here is its updated graph. On 24<sup>th</sup> October its market cap was around $76B, it is now around $75B. So, yes, Elder was right, it has been basically flat for 10 weeks where the preceding 10 weeks it had increased by $8B (~12%).<br />
        <br />
        Had the trend of the previous 10 weeks continued, the market cap of (USDT+USDC) would have been $25B higher than it is. One way of looking at this would be that traders "withdrew" $25B or around 10% of the (USDT+USDC) market cap on 24<sup>th</sup> October. On this basis Elder is just wrong, the off-ramp has been quite busy.<br />
        <br />
        Elder notes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">that</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Even if we assume a large percentage of stablecoins are used for non-crypto things (sports betting, remittances, crimes), the recent issuance still looks at odds with the trend.
        </blockquote>
        First, this contradicts the premise of Elder's question as I understand it. Second, most of the uses Elder cites involve a chain of transactions from fiat to stablecoin to fiat on one or more exchanges. These would not cause a net increase in demand for the stablecoin, which would come from and go back to the exchange's reserves.<br />
        <br />
        Then Elder <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">suggest that</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Maybe demand is high because crypto traders have been parking money rather than seeking to withdraw it?
        </blockquote>
        First, demand isn't high relative to the historic trend, it is now $25B lower. Second, even if we accept Elder's $20B number, this is peanuts relative to the $1.2T drop in aggregate cryptocurrency market cap.<br />

        Finally in this section Elder <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">asks</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        More idle money in the system ought to be good news for the likes of Coinbase, which uses the promise of higher yields on USDC deposits to sell monthly subscription schemes.  And how have Coinbase shares been doing?
        </blockquote>
        The day Bitcoin hit the skids on 8<sup>th</sup>, COIN closed at $387.27. By 11/20 it was down 38% while Bitcoin was down 47%. It can hardly be a surprise that COIN is highly correlated with Bitcoin.<br />
        <br />
        <h3>What explains trash crash PTSD?</h3>
        Next, Elder asks why cryptocurrencies haven't resumed their <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">progress moonwards</a>:<br />

        In anything to do with cryptocurrency, and definitely in this case, I'd go with "darkly cynical".  He then <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">asks</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        If a market’s not deep, eﬃcient or clean enough to digest a bit of one-day volatility, why get involved?
        </blockquote>
        I'd agree with Elder on this. If we look at the log plot of Bitcoin's history, we can barely see the 47% drop in 6 weeks last October. We can just see, to take some recent examples, the 48% drop in 5 weeks in early 2020, and the 42% drop in 2 weeks in mid-2021. Traders who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Of course, the volatility is precisely the thing that brings the traders to Bitcoin.<br />
        <h3>Where’s the volume?</h3>
        Elder notes a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">wave of selling</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Crypto exchange-traded products have been haemorrhaging money all week.  Spot ETP net redemptions yesterday were $1.14bn, including $901mn just from bitcoin ETPs, according to JPMorgan estimates. That’s the worst single day for net outflows since February.<br />
        <br />
        With so much selling, you might expect to see an increase in bitcoin velocity, which measures the rate at which tokens move on the chain.<br />

        This graph covers a longer history than Elder's. Already back in 2021 <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396">Igor Makarov &amp; Antoinette Schoar</a> found that the "rate at which tokens move on the chain" was irrelevant:<br />
        <blockquote>
        90% of transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain is not tied to economically meaningful activities but is the byproduct of the Bitcoin protocol design as well as the preference of many participants for anonymity ... exchanges play a central role in the Bitcoin system. They explain 75% of real Bitcoin volume. 
        </blockquote>
        Velocity dropped sharply until November 2023, and then continued to drop gradually. November 2023 was the start of a major increase in Bitcoin's price, which coincided with a sustained increase in trading volume on exchanges.<br />

        It thus seems likely that the trend identified by Makarov &amp; Schoar that on-chain activity was largely confided to exchanges increased between 2021 and 2023, and was then saturated.  Elder's explanation is only <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">part of the story</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Bitcoin velocity has been plummeting for years, for reasonable reasons.  “Digital gold” overtook “internet money” as the preferred reason to hold, while derivatives like perpetual futures removed any need to faﬀ around with the underlying asset.
        </blockquote>
        It isn't just derivatives. Spot trading happens on exchanges. The blockchain is pretty much only used for inter-exchange netting transactions. So Elder's question <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883">misses the point</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Nevertheless, is it odd to have a sudden wave of selling that’s almost invisible
        in the underlying asset? Bitcoin velocity has barely changed over the past
        month, having bounced meekly oﬀ a record low in early October. Why?
        </blockquote>
        Having a vast derivative market based off a much smaller spot market on exchanges based on a tiny set of transactions on the blockchain is a wonderful playground for traders, because it is easy to manipulate.<br />

        Spoiler: No. In this section Elder expresses skepticism about a piece by Alex “Crypto Alex” Saunders, of Citigroup suggesting that:<br />
        <blockquote>
        The halving cycle is a reason that long-time Bitcoin holders are nervous. We show the price performance in the years after halvings in Figure 3 with the second year showing weakness. These crypto winters have been associated with 80%+drawdowns in the past as shown in Figure 4.
        </blockquote>
        Elder doesn't need any help from me on this "chart necromancy". Halvenings primarily affect miners by roughly halving their income without a corresponding decrease in costs. This may force them to sell coins they have stashed, which at the margin may drive the price down. But with miners' income currently around $40M/day and recent volume peaks on major exchanges around $1.4B/day this is likely to have marginal impact.<br />

On November 21st Bryce Elder posed [_Five questions from an ignorant no-coiner about the crypto crash_](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883). Each of his five questions identified some interesting apparent anomalies.

Below the fold I look into each of his questions, asking how anomalous its anomalies really were and whether they have persisted into the New Year.

TL;DR none of them are really surprising but reaching that conclusion took a good deal of research.

### Why doesn’t network difficulty fall?

Elder explains Bitcoin&#39;s [difficulty mechanism](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm has a difficulty ratchet to keep production steady. Network difficulty adjusts every two weeks, approximately, based on whether miners have been finding new blocks for the blockchain too quickly or too slowly.

And then identifies the [first anomaly](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Difficulty tightens when a higher bitcoin price is encouraging miners to join the market, that much makes sense. But when a lower bitcoin price is squeezing margins and pushing the least efficient miners out, shouldn’t difficulty fall?

Here is the chart Elder is looking at.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAUlMeuRv8jQCkLl1PbOs_lJd2kjKpmnnZS7xQQn7oVB7M4CJAQ5PFi5tA4i0SoSQirSkQePSB0VGpDtT0RknRurgResWcHaVxdG3bvsXKdxusMhfQXR6mztzf57I_VrpqtaDdj0aOWkJ-HSWG7V4Nh0PLT01oq6vN4_LGYaSQt5r-Mxu0q_hwQNrBsoQ/s320/Difficulty.jpeg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAUlMeuRv8jQCkLl1PbOs_lJd2kjKpmnnZS7xQQn7oVB7M4CJAQ5PFi5tA4i0SoSQirSkQePSB0VGpDtT0RknRurgResWcHaVxdG3bvsXKdxusMhfQXR6mztzf57I_VrpqtaDdj0aOWkJ-HSWG7V4Nh0PLT01oq6vN4_LGYaSQt5r-Mxu0q_hwQNrBsoQ/s1020/Difficulty.jpeg)[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883)
Then [Elder asks](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Maybe difficulty lags behind the price? As said above, the ratchet only adjusts approximately every two weeks. Total hashrate oﬀers a more dynamic measure of power deployed to the network, albeit an estimated one based on how long it’s taking to mine a block. Any change in market structure might show up there first.
&#62;
&#62; And has it? Not really:

The first thing to note is that, depending upon power costs and where they are in the queue for the latest rigs from Bitmain, miners margins vary greatly. So Elder is right that, if one of the two-week adjustemnts increases the difficulty, some of the least economic rigs should be switched off. In theory, if the adjustment decreases the difficulty, some of these idled rigs should be switched back on.

Eyeballing the graph, between early July and late October the price was between $110K and $120K, a 9% range. During that period the difficulty increased from around 140trn to around 155trn, about an 11% range. These aren&#39;t big changes, but it appears a bit strange that roughly flat price coincides with a steady-ish increase in difficulty.

Elder has some possible [explanations](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Do miners with sunk costs keep running on negative margins in the hope of getting lucky? Are a handful of big miners, maybe advantaged by free power or whatever, keeping difficulty high to drive out competitors, either inadvertently or as part of some devious plan to centralise production and control the network? Or has mining become 55 per cent more eﬃcient since last November?

I estimate that during that time Bitmain and its competitors shipped an additional 1000EH/s to the miners, over and above the new rigs replacing obsolete ones. These leading-edge rigs would have been turned on immediately. During that time the hash rate rose from about 870EH/s to around 1120EH/s, or about 250EH/s. So around 150EH/s must have represented idled, less-efficient rigs being turned on. At the start of the period at most 85% of the rig fleet was working. At the end of the period, as the price started to fall, the most efficient miners had about 100EH/s more than they did at the beginning.

In the subsequent 2 months the price dropped from about $120K to around $85K and the hash rate dropped from around 1120EH/s to around 1060EH/s, or by 60EH/s. But in that time there ws an incremental 50EH/s of new rigs. So 110EH/s of the 150EH/s from the originally idle fleet of uneconomic rigs were turned off. This within the margin or error of my back-of-the-envelope estimates.

My take is that what happened was what should have been expected. Elder&#39;s view was too simplistic, and he was misled by (a) the noise in the graph, and ((b) the fact that the Y axis doesn&#39;t start at zero, making the noise much more evident.

Elder goes on to note an issue I&#39;ve been writing about for [really a long time](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Related, is it a worry that just three mining pools accounted for more than 45 per cent of this week’s block production? Given nearly all the hardware used across the network is Chinese-made, with Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies alone having an estimated market share of 82 per cent, when do concentration levels among a few organisations become a security concern?

Yes, this concentration has been a problem for Bitcoin&#39;s [entire history](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/06/pseudonymity-and-cooperation.html), but everyone has decided to ignore it. As I write, on 6th January 2026, over the last three days Foundry USA and AntPool have controlled 51.2% of the hash power. As I explained at length in [_Sabotaging Bitcoin_](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/12/sabotaging-bitcoin.html), there are practical difficulties facing an insider attack with 30% of the hash power, but with 51.2% things are much easier.

And, in November, Reuters reports that [_Bitcoin mining in China rebounds, defying 2021 ban_](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bitcoin-mining-china-rebounds-defying-2021-ban-2025-11-24/):

&#62; Bitcoin mining is quietly staging a comeback in China despite being banned four years ago, as individual and corporate miners exploit cheap electricity and a data center boom in some energy-rich provinces, according to miners and industry data.
&#62;
&#62; China had been the world&#39;s biggest crypto mining country until Beijing banned all cryptocurrency trading and mining in 2021, citing threats to the country&#39;s financial stability and energy conservation.
&#62;
&#62; After having seen its global bitcoin mining market share slump to zero as a result of the ban, China crept back to third place with a 14% share at the end of October, according to Hashrate Index, which tracks bitcoin mining activities.

This may be what the [80% of new data centers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/26/1113802/china-ai-data-centers-unused/) in China that were empty because unsuitable for AI are being used for.

### What’s the deal with Tether?

Zeke Faux described Tether as &#34; [practically quilted out of red flags](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether)&#34; and they are [still flapping](https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/the-red-flags-multiply-for-tether). What attracted Elder&#39;s attention [was this](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Stablecoins have long been pitched as crypto’s on-ramp. Swapping fiat money for a fiat-pegged stablecoin like Tether’s USDT or Circle’s USDC allows a trader to switch in and out of positions without having to touch tradfi.
&#62;
&#62; Shouldn’t an on-ramp also work as an off-ramp? There’s not much evidence it does. In the six weeks or so when $1.2tn in value was drawn down from the cryptoverse, the market cap of USDT has [increased by approximately $20bn](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/):

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhS1UnacunZsVNq-Khi-oABPmezhCLamajYgEI0LIqPeeWGF99rWQn9v-w4cf27p3ZvbGw83xfoYA_LDzOx0d0kpolibuMIX5G6_gAIgyWR6kY6XftBeY9U0gN0MW8KHyD1AVW-3shXX4qmrH793oY9BQi1DeVtCWQHpMeonosGrv8BEO43Tq13rBvm_jll/w200-h133/USDT_1Y.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhS1UnacunZsVNq-Khi-oABPmezhCLamajYgEI0LIqPeeWGF99rWQn9v-w4cf27p3ZvbGw83xfoYA_LDzOx0d0kpolibuMIX5G6_gAIgyWR6kY6XftBeY9U0gN0MW8KHyD1AVW-3shXX4qmrH793oY9BQi1DeVtCWQHpMeonosGrv8BEO43Tq13rBvm_jll/s1200/USDT_1Y.png)[Source](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)
This USDT graph is updated from the one Elder used. It shows a clear break in the upward trend on 24th October. In the 10 preceding weeks it increased by $17B (~10%) as Bitcoin traded beteween a low of $108K and a high on 6th October of almost $125K.

In the 10 weeks since it has increased by only $3B as Bitcoin dropped from $111K to a low of $84K on 22nd November, subsequently trading in a range from there to $94K.

The only other stablecoin that matters [is USDC](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; USDC hasn’t been quite as resilient but over the period is still basically flat:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjl9K7v1xuLcNFn_FO6kO0IJi5hEXOvTjkLioQrwzKfBK5WXSbZ6EkW7ORap7yVpxDL7wa79zu3tDbNtxyyaxay2iTX0keN6fEE8tNnf_SutkBj415f83o_Qv7itHdJ-wAn26NqTOdjbYDQKOLbjhw7LJDv_zLlTKjwZ_obr5CxfDZyUMc72hvcSwvQIeBT/w200-h133/USDC_1Y.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjl9K7v1xuLcNFn_FO6kO0IJi5hEXOvTjkLioQrwzKfBK5WXSbZ6EkW7ORap7yVpxDL7wa79zu3tDbNtxyyaxay2iTX0keN6fEE8tNnf_SutkBj415f83o_Qv7itHdJ-wAn26NqTOdjbYDQKOLbjhw7LJDv_zLlTKjwZ_obr5CxfDZyUMc72hvcSwvQIeBT/s1200/USDC_1Y.png)[Source](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/)
Here is its updated graph. On 24th October its market cap was around $76B, it is now around $75B. So, yes, Elder was right, it has been basically flat for 10 weeks where the preceding 10 weeks it had increased by $8B (~12%).

Had the trend of the previous 10 weeks continued, the market cap of (USDT+USDC) would have been $25B higher than it is. One way of looking at this would be that traders &#34;withdrew&#34; $25B or around 10% of the (USDT+USDC) market cap on 24th October. On this basis Elder is just wrong, the off-ramp has been quite busy.

Elder notes [that](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Even if we assume a large percentage of stablecoins are used for non-crypto things (sports betting, remittances, crimes), the recent issuance still looks at odds with the trend.

First, this contradicts the premise of Elder&#39;s question as I understand it. Second, most of the uses Elder cites involve a chain of transactions from fiat to stablecoin to fiat on one or more exchanges. These would not cause a net increase in demand for the stablecoin, which would come from and go back to the exchange&#39;s reserves.

Then Elder [suggest that](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Maybe demand is high because crypto traders have been parking money rather than seeking to withdraw it?

First, demand isn&#39;t high relative to the historic trend, it is now $25B lower. Second, even if we accept Elder&#39;s $20B number, this is peanuts relative to the $1.2T drop in aggregate cryptocurrency market cap.

Finally in this section Elder [asks](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; More idle money in the system ought to be good news for the likes of Coinbase, which uses the promise of higher yields on USDC deposits to sell monthly subscription schemes. And how have Coinbase shares been doing?

The day Bitcoin hit the skids on 8th, COIN closed at $387.27. By 11/20 it was down 38% while Bitcoin was down 47%. It can hardly be a surprise that COIN is highly correlated with Bitcoin.

### What explains trash crash PTSD?

Next, Elder asks why cryptocurrencies haven&#39;t resumed their [progress moonwards](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; A popular argument among crypto commentators is that token prices are down because traders are still digesting [one bad day in early October](https://www.ft.com/content/75fa4323-51ea-4ed2-9c07-b995e09ace49).

He suggests [some reasons](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Reasons for the October drawdown go from banal (maybe the high-beta cryptosphere just amplified [an equities pullback](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/bE-qU1zWhzRe8yb0lcjRx2aunbLtAyj8z2535Yt4JLWI44YcnXctrgw5q0-1EcyiTPjt5ZYK4SaNoVUfgMehQ6UD7rKKldXgNL23GrzS7lP66YdWVVIjsnfpnGMJucV-sIIjAuxjx4FWKQNFBVXrfI1wvxafOLeHP6Ni_-L9DwhylPLva04gMWfiA9E3s2ajAvYJxG12dAOOws7lMMUTfkQcs-bs6ezPgsPBL0Wgbzut_zYLwmxSCCjF0_W-YwEmLJqpjHyen3WEHsHC7oHXvqNs7hsJnWj58l6BWdWEdNyvE5VnYux7JvQQvVp39gu7CkPeQ6UUAU5YOWEPnUNOnKtcqiTvCH3WHTgkXPrE53x7mE15PS72Y0t9qf0/jL38GmV_vgDbxRL89uL27NpEMDfNsj96/13) on US-China trade tensions?) to wonky (maybe it all cascaded from a weird synthetic stablecoin [depegging](https://www.netcoins.com/blog/ethenas-usde-depeg-an-overview-and-its-relation-to-the-ena-token) on one marketplace?) to the darkly cynical (maybe the big sharp drop was to let bucket-shop crypto brokers [close out customer positions](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/Kfg6vUvHmhO5oSNIKqDQdSUYFX15RGBzlXnH0KWAQb5sD2tDDzflwxTfqRLPPd4bntFtS9kBeHvEScDMPl5O8bJwi2Xj_n9DLw9IJWskiaIWrwvNFAIQbSYopuU5K7oHvjvY2mCCXZ8f1q2qu0k-NwygxiBhW_9pRIylO87T5cYv92o0EMPl22nloZeyZ9Oqy8BNISb8tXfkRKMU3NBgeDrMf6O5Yk-65sMrglXSqAzcAGZKu120PZ96889dWziL5j4rpUr793tLH-y1MwsIjPnXydKz_RyZgnS7mbz_r2pG6n6tWt36eHpqmXq66_C12B8szzDOkperchqjcEFFQSPfgRfD0evt2SyrO1bWL1SD2JroVz-_6FjqQKk/l_W3PlbzqqN5mfkKpVcnp6VP5fLajwkz/13) they’d never actually bought?).

In anything to do with cryptocurrency, and definitely in this case, I&#39;d go with &#34;darkly cynical&#34;. He then [asks](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; If a market’s not deep, eﬃcient or clean enough to digest a bit of one-day volatility, why get involved?

I&#39;d agree with Elder on this. If we look at the log plot of Bitcoin&#39;s history, we can barely see the 47% drop in 6 weeks last October. We can just see, to take some recent examples, the 48% drop in 5 weeks in early 2020, and the 42% drop in 2 weeks in mid-2021. Traders who don&#39;t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Of course, the volatility is precisely the thing that brings the traders to Bitcoin.

### Where’s the volume?

Elder notes a [wave of selling](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Crypto exchange-traded products have been haemorrhaging money all week. Spot ETP net redemptions yesterday were $1.14bn, including $901mn just from bitcoin ETPs, according to JPMorgan estimates. That’s the worst single day for net outflows since February.
&#62;
&#62; With so much selling, you might expect to see an increase in bitcoin velocity, which measures the rate at which tokens move on the chain.

This graph covers a longer history than Elder&#39;s. Already back in 2021 [Igor Makarov &#38; Antoinette Schoar](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396) found that the &#34;rate at which tokens move on the chain&#34; was irrelevant:

&#62; 90% of transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain is not tied to economically meaningful activities but is the byproduct of the Bitcoin protocol design as well as the preference of many participants for anonymity ... exchanges play a central role in the Bitcoin system. They explain 75% of real Bitcoin volume.

Velocity dropped sharply until November 2023, and then continued to drop gradually. November 2023 was the start of a major increase in Bitcoin&#39;s price, which coincided with a sustained increase in trading volume on exchanges.

It thus seems likely that the trend identified by Makarov &#38; Schoar that on-chain activity was largely confided to exchanges increased between 2021 and 2023, and was then saturated. Elder&#39;s explanation is only [part of the story](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Bitcoin velocity has been plummeting for years, for reasonable reasons. “Digital gold” overtook “internet money” as the preferred reason to hold, while derivatives like perpetual futures removed any need to faﬀ around with the underlying asset.

It isn&#39;t just derivatives. Spot trading happens on exchanges. The blockchain is pretty much only used for inter-exchange netting transactions. So Elder&#39;s question [misses the point](https://www.ft.com/content/2012681b-67b2-496a-a7cd-4811eb497883):

&#62; Nevertheless, is it odd to have a sudden wave of selling that’s almost invisible
&#62; in the underlying asset? Bitcoin velocity has barely changed over the past
&#62; month, having bounced meekly oﬀ a record low in early October. Why?

Having a vast derivative market based off a much smaller spot market on exchanges based on a tiny set of transactions on the blockchain is a wonderful playground for traders, because it is easy to manipulate.

### Is past performance indicative of future results?

Spoiler: No. In this section Elder expresses skepticism about a piece by Alex “Crypto Alex” Saunders, of Citigroup suggesting that:

&#62; The halving cycle is a reason that long-time Bitcoin holders are nervous. We show the price performance in the years after halvings in Figure 3 with the second year showing weakness. These crypto winters have been associated with 80%+drawdowns in the past as shown in Figure 4.

Elder doesn&#39;t need any help from me on this &#34;chart necromancy&#34;. Halvenings primarily affect miners by roughly halving their income without a corresponding decrease in costs. This may force them to sell coins they have stashed, which at the margin may drive the price down. But with miners&#39; income currently around $40M/day and recent volume peaks on major exchanges around $1.4B/day this is likely to have marginal impact.</source:markdown>

In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team at Harvard were working on the Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator. The machine was massive, a deafening clatter of electromechanical relays, and it had stopped working. They opened the casing to find the problem. It was a moth. An actual, literal moth,</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>**Update**: Never mind! It turns that Google’s issue is with _unreachable_ `robots.txt` files, not absent `robots.txt` files. They really need to improve their messaging. Stand down everyone.

A bit has been flipped on Google Search.

Previously, the Googlebot would index any web page it came across, unless a `robots.txt` file said otherwise.

Now, [a `robots.txt` file is _required_ in order for the Googlebot to index a website](https://support.google.com/webmasters/community-video/360202946/fix-robots-txt-unreachable-error-website-not-indexing).

This puzzles me. Until now, Google was all about “organising the world’s information and making it accessible.” This switch-up will limit “the world’s information” to “the information on websites that have a `robots.txt` file.”

They’re free to do this. Despite what some people think, Google isn’t a utility. It’s a business. Other search engines are available, with different business models. [Kagi](https://kagi.com/). [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/). Google != the World Wide Web.

I am curious about this latest move with Google Search though. I’d love to know if it only applies to Google’s search bot. Google has other bots out crawling the web: `Adsbot-Google`, `Google-Extended`, `Googlebot-Image`, `GoogleOther`, `Mediapartners-Google`. I’m probably missing a few.

If the new default only applies to the searchbot and doesn’t include say, the crawler that’s fracking the web in order train Google’s large language model, then this is how things work now:

- Your website _won’t_ appear in search results unless you explicitly **opt in**.
- Your website _will_ be used as training data unless you explicitly **opt out**.

It would be good to get some clarity on this. Alas, the Google Search team are notoriously tight-lipped so I’m not holding my breath.</source:markdown>

      <title>Pluralistic: It&#39;s not normal (14 Jan 2026)</title>
      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/14/sole-and-despotic/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links It's not normal: Remember when you owned stuff? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Telco rats out protesters; Rogers v Net Neutrality; Jailhouse lawyer v Stingrays; Black Panther self-care. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. It's not normal (permalink) Samantha: This town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to&#8230;but I'm not. Mrs Krabappel: It'll take you about six weeks, dear. -The Simpsons, "Bart's Friend Falls in Love," S3E23, May 7, 1992 We are living through weird times, and they've persisted for so long that you probably don't even notice it. But these times are not normal. Now, I realize that this covers a lot of ground, and without detracting from all the other ways in which the world is weird and bad, I want to focus on one specific and pervasive and awful way in which this world is not normal, in part because this abnormality has a defined cause, a precise start date, and an obvious, actionable remedy. 6 years, 5 months and 22 days after Fox aired "Bart's Friend Falls in Love," Bill Clinton signed a new bill into law: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). Under Section 1201 of the DMCA, it's a felony to modify your own property in ways that the manufacturer disapproves of, even if your modifications accomplish some totally innocuous, legal, and socially beneficial goal. Not a little felony, either: DMCA 1201 provides for a five year sentence and a $500,000 fine for a first offense. Back when the DMCA was being debated, its proponents insisted that their critics were overreacting. They pointed to the legal barriers to invoking DMCA 1201, and insisted that these new restrictions would only apply to a few marginal products in narrow ways that the average person would never even notice. But that was obvious nonsense, obvious even in 1998, and far more obvious today, more than a quarter-century on. In order for a manufacturer to criminalize modifications to your own property, they have to satisfy two criteria: first, they must sell you a device with a computer in it; and second, they must design that computer with an "access control" that you have to work around in order to make a modification. For example, say your toaster requires that you scan your bread before it will toast it, to make sure that you're only using a special, expensive kind of bread that kicks back a royalty to the manufacturer. If the embedded computer that does the scanning ships from the factory with a program that is supposed to prevent you from turning off the scanning step, then it is a felony to modify your toaster to work with "unauthorized bread": https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/ If this sounds outlandish, then a) You definitely didn't walk the floor at CES last week, where there were a zillion "cooking robots" that required proprietary feedstock; and b) You haven't really thought hard about your iPhone (which will not allow you to install software of your choosing): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones But back in 1998, computers &#8211; even the kind of low-powered computers that you'd embed in an appliance &#8211; were expensive and relatively rare. No longer! Today, manufacturers source powerful "System on a Chip" (SoC) processors at prices ranging from $0.25 to $8. These are full-fledged computers, easily capable of running an "access control" that satisfies DMCA 1201. Likewise, in 1998, "access controls" (also called "DRM," "technical protection measures," etc) were a rarity in the field. That was because computer scientists broadly viewed these measures as useless. A determined adversary could always find a way around an access control, and they could package up that break as a software tool and costlessly, instantaneously distribute it over the internet to everyone in the world who wanted to do something that an access control impeded. Access controls were a stupid waste of engineering resources and a source of needless complexity and brittleness: https://memex.craphound.com/2012/01/10/lockdown-the-coming-war-on-general-purpose-computing/ But &#8211; as critics pointed out in 1998 &#8211; chips were obviously going to get much cheaper, and if the US Congress made it a felony to bypass an access control, then every kind of manufacturer would be tempted to add some cheap SoCs to their products so they could add access controls and thereby felonize any uses of their products that cut into their profits. Basically, the DMCA offered manufacturers a bargain: add a dollar or two to the bill of materials for your product, and in return, the US government will imprison any competitors who offer your customers a "complementary good" that improves on it. It's even worse than this: another thing that was obvious in 1998 was that once a manufacturer added a chip to a device, they would probably also figure out a way to connect it to the internet. Once that device is connected to the internet, the manufacturer can push software updates to it at will, which will be installed without user intervention. What's more, by using an access control in connection with that over-the-air update mechanism, the manufacturer can make it a felony to block its updates. Which means that a manufacturer can sell you a device and then mandatorily update it at a later date to take away its functionality, and then sell that functionality back to you as a "subscription": https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process A thing that keeps happening: https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202166/snoo-premium-subscription-happiest-baby And happening: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer And happening: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification In fact, it happens so often I've coined a term for it, "The Darth Vader MBA" (as in, "I'm altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further"): https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/01/fulu/#i-am-altering-the-deal Here's what this all means: any manufacturer who devotes a small amount of engineering work and incurs a small hardware expense can extinguish private property rights altogether. What do I mean by private property? Well, we can look to Blackstone's 1753 treatise: The right of property; or that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe. You can't own your iPhone. If you take your iPhone to Apple and they tell you that it is beyond repair, you have to throw it away. If the repair your phone needs involves "parts pairing" (where a new part won't be recognized until an Apple technician "initializes" it through a DMCA-protected access control), then it's a felony to get that phone fixed somewhere else. If Apple tells you your phone is no longer supported because they've updated their OS, then it's a felony to wipe the phone and put a different OS on it (because installing a new OS involves bypassing an "access control" in the phone's bootloader). If Apple tells you that you can't have a piece of software &#8211; like ICE Block, an app that warns you if there are nearby ICE killers who might shoot you in the head through your windshield, which Apple has barred from its App Store on the grounds that ICE is a "protected class" &#8211; then you can't install it, because installing software that isn't delivered via the App Store involves bypassing an "access control" that checks software to ensure that it's authorized (just like the toaster with its unauthorized bread). It's not just iPhones: versions of this play out in your medical implants (hearing aid, insulin pump, etc); appliances (stoves, fridges, washing machines); cars and ebikes; set-top boxes and game consoles; ebooks and streaming videos; small appliances (toothbrushes, TVs, speakers), and more. Increasingly, things that you actually own are the exception, not the rule. And this is not normal. The end of ownership represents an overturn of a foundation of modern civilization. The fact that the only "people" who can truly own something are the transhuman, immortal colony organisms we call "Limited Liability Corporations" is an absolutely surreal reversal of the normal order of things. It's a reversal with deep implications: for one thing, it means that you can't protect yourself from raids on your private data or ready cash by adding privacy blockers to your device, which would make it impossible for airlines or ecommerce sites to guess about how rich/desperate you are before quoting you a "personalized price": https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/11/nothing-personal/#instacartography It also means you can't stop your device from leaking information about your movements, or even your conversations &#8211; Microsoft has announced that it will gather all of your private communications and ship them to its servers for use by "agentic AI": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4 Microsoft has also confirmed that it provides US authorities with warrantless, secret access to your data: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/ This is deeply abnormal. Sure, greedy corporate control freaks weren't invented in the 21st century, but the laws that let those sociopaths put you in prison for failing to arrange your affairs to their benefit &#8211; and your own detriment &#8211; are. But because computers got faster and cheaper over decades, the end of ownership has had an incremental rollout, and we've barely noticed that it's happened. Sure, we get irritated when our garage-door opener suddenly requires us to look at seven ads every time we use the app that makes it open or close: https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/09/lead-me-not-into-temptation/#chamberlain But societally, we haven't connected that incident to this wider phenomenon. It stinks here, but we're all used to it. It's not normal to buy a book and then not be able to lend it, sell it, or give it away. Lending, selling and giving away books is older than copyright. It's older than publishing. It's older than printing. It's older than paper. It is fucking weird (and also terrible) (obviously) that there's a new kind of very popular book that you can go to prison for lending, selling or giving away.

Mrs Krabappel: It&#39;ll take you about six weeks, dear. -The Simpsons, &#34;Bart&#39;s Friend Falls in Love,&#34; S3E23, May 7, 1992 We are living through weird times, and they&#39;ve persisted for so long that you probably don&#39;t even notice it. But these times are not normal. Now, I realize that this covers a lot of ground, and without detracting from all the other ways in which the world is weird and bad, I want to focus on one specific and pervasive and awful way in which this world is not normal, in part because this abnormality has a defined cause, a precise start date, and an obvious, actionable remedy. 6 years, 5 months and 22 days after Fox aired &#34;Bart&#39;s Friend Falls in Love,&#34; Bill Clinton signed a new bill into law: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). Under Section 1201 of the DMCA, it&#39;s a felony to modify your own property in ways that the manufacturer disapproves of, even if your modifications accomplish some totally innocuous, legal, and socially beneficial goal. Not a little felony, either: DMCA 1201 provides for a five year sentence and a $500,000 fine for a first offense. Back when the DMCA was being debated, its proponents insisted that their critics were overreacting. They pointed to the legal barriers to invoking DMCA 1201, and insisted that these new restrictions would only apply to a few marginal products in narrow ways that the average person would never even notice. But that was obvious nonsense, obvious even in 1998, and far more obvious today, more than a quarter-century on. In order for a manufacturer to criminalize modifications to your own property, they have to satisfy two criteria: first, they must sell you a device with a computer in it; and second, they must design that computer with an &#34;access control&#34; that you have to work around in order to make a modification. For example, say your toaster requires that you scan your bread before it will toast it, to make sure that you&#39;re only using a special, expensive kind of bread that kicks back a royalty to the manufacturer. If the embedded computer that does the scanning ships from the factory with a program that is supposed to prevent you from turning off the scanning step, then it is a felony to modify your toaster to work with &#34;unauthorized bread&#34;: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/ If this sounds outlandish, then a) You definitely didn&#39;t walk the floor at CES last week, where there were a zillion &#34;cooking robots&#34; that required proprietary feedstock; and b) You haven&#39;t really thought hard about your iPhone (which will not allow you to install software of your choosing): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones But back in 1998, computers – even the kind of low-powered computers that you&#39;d embed in an appliance – were expensive and relatively rare. No longer! Today, manufacturers source powerful &#34;System on a Chip&#34; (SoC) processors at prices ranging from $0.25 to $8. These are full-fledged computers, easily capable of running an &#34;access control&#34; that satisfies DMCA 1201. Likewise, in 1998, &#34;access controls&#34; (also called &#34;DRM,&#34; &#34;technical protection measures,&#34; etc) were a rarity in the field. That was because computer scientists broadly viewed these measures as useless. A determined adversary could always find a way around an access control, and they could package up that break as a software tool and costlessly, instantaneously distribute it over the internet to everyone in the world who wanted to do something that an access control impeded. Access controls were a stupid waste of engineering resources and a source of needless complexity and brittleness: https://memex.craphound.com/2012/01/10/lockdown-the-coming-war-on-general-purpose-computing/ But – as critics pointed out in 1998 – chips were obviously going to get much cheaper, and if the US Congress made it a felony to bypass an access control, then every kind of manufacturer would be tempted to add some cheap SoCs to their products so they could add access controls and thereby felonize any uses of their products that cut into their profits.

This investment will enable the PSF to make crucial security advances to CPython and the Python Package Index (PyPI) benefiting all users, and it will also sustain the foundation’s core work supporting the Python language, ecosystem, and global community.

Note that while security is a focus these funds will also support other aspects of the PSF&#39;s work:

&#62; Anthropic’s support will also go towards the PSF’s core work, including the Developer in Residence program driving contributions to CPython, community support through grants and other programs, running core infrastructure such as PyPI, and more.

      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/13/not-sorry/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links Sorry, eh: I sincerely regret that all my ideas will not lose billions of dollars, destroy jobs or make your country more dependent on American tech. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: 20 years a blogger; Woz on Network Neutrality; Moveon endorses Bernie. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Sorry, eh (permalink) Like all the best Americans, I'm Canadian, and while I have lived abroad for most of this century, I still hew faithfully to our folkways, which is why I'd like to start this essay by apologizing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm a technology writer, which means I'm supposed to be encouraging you to throw hundreds of billions of dollars at the money-losingest technology in human history, AI. No one has ever lost as much money as the AI companies. There is no way to operate one of Nvidia's big AI-optimized GPUs without losing money. The owners of these GPUs who have lost the least money are the ones who rushed into buying GPUs without ensuring they'd have electricity to power them, and have been forced to leave their GPUs to age in warehouses. The minute they plug in those GPUs, they'll start losing money, and the more they use them, the more money they'll lose. I'm sorry. As a technology writer, I'm supposed to be telling you that this bet will some day pay off, because one day we will have shoveled so many words into the word-guessing program that it wakes up and learns how to actually do the jobs it is failing spectacularly at today. This is a proposition akin to the idea that if we keep breeding horses to run faster and faster, one of them will give birth to a locomotive. Humans possess intelligence, and machines do not. The difference between a human and a word-guessing program isn't how many words the human knows. I'm sorry. I know that when we talk about "digital sovereignty," we're obliged to talk about how we can build more data-centres that we can fill up with money-losing chips from American silicon monopolists in the hopes of destroying as many jobs as possible while blowing through our clean energy goals and enshittifying as much of our potable water as possible. I don't have any advice for how to do that. I'm sorry! As Canada contemplates our response to the collapse of the American empire and its alliances with the world, the cornerstone of our current strategy is sacrificing our dollars, water and energy in order to become more dependent on America, in a weird and improbable bet that we will figure out how to make millions of Canadians unemployed. I'm sorry, that just doesn't sound like a great idea to me. If I can beg your indulgence, I'd like to propose an alternative. Back in 2012, Canada passed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act. It's a law that bans Canadian companies from modifying America's digital tech exports. We passed it because the US threatened us with tariffs: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't sell jailbreaking kits for phones and consoles, which would let Canadian sellers offer goods and services to Canadian buyers outside of US app stores, sidestepping the 30% app tax that Apple, Google, Microsoft, Sony and others impose on our digital economy. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't sell mechanics a universal diagnostic tool that turns every "check engine" light into a useful error message. Instead, Canadian mechanics have to send $10,000/year/manufacturer to America for a proprietary car diagnosis kit. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't offer ink cartridge manufacturers software that will ensure their cartridges work in the printers Canadians buy from the American inkjet cartel. As a result, Canadians have to spend $10,000/gallon on ink, making it the most expensive fluid a Canadian civilian can purchase without a government permit. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't sell our farmers software that lets them start using their tractors as soon as they've fixed them. Instead, after a Canadian farmer fixes their tractor, they have to wait for a service call from a rep for a US ag-tech monopolist who'll type an unlock code into the tractor's keyboard and charge the farmer a couple hundred bucks for this "service." Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can't revive one of the most successful technologies in modern history: the home video recorder. Remember those? First we had VCRs, then we had digital successors like the Tivo. Canadian law says you're allowed to record the video that comes into your home, whether by broadcast, cable, satellite or streaming. But Bill C-11 bans a Canadian company from selling you a gadget that lets you save the video you get in an app or from a set-top box. It's crazy: we have actually uninvented the VCR! You know how everyone is pissed off about their favourite shows being yanked from the streaming services? Repeal C-11 and you could just save those shows forever. Repeal C-11 and you'd kill the grinchy little racket that services like Prime pull, where Christmas cartoons are in the free tier from March to November, and cost $3.99 to watch between November and March. Just tape 'em in August and save 'em for later! It doesn't stop there. Remember when Facebook banned all links to the news in Canada? Repeal C-11 and a Canadian company could sell you an alternative Facebook app that puts the news back into your feed! Repeal C-11 and Canadians could get an alternative app that replaces all the streaming services, letting you search and stream every service you have an account for in one place, mixing in Canadian content from the NFB, public broadcasters, and commercial services. Virtually every Canadian ministry, corporation and household is locked into a US Big Tech silo. Any of these could be shut down at a single word from Trump to any of the tech giants who've lined up to do his bidding. Repeal C-11 and we can extract all our data from these walled gardens/prisons and get it onto auditable, trustworthy, transparent open source software, hosted in data-centres located safely on Canadian soil. If there's one thing Canadians are good it, it's going to other countries and extracting their wealth. We're world champions at it. America's tech monopolies have sequestered trillions of dollars worth of monopoly rents on their balance sheets. This is dead capital, being pissed up the wall on nonsense like stock buybacks and data-centres and grotesque executive bonuses. As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: "Your margin is my opportunity." America's tech trillions represent a rich and readily accessible seam that we can extract &#8211; safely, from our own country! &#8211; and turn into our billions, and an exportable line of products that the whole world would beat a path to our door to buy. Look, I'm sorry. I don't have any ideas for how Canada can get to a better future by lighting billions on fire in a bet on a failing technology whose dubious profitability depends on ruining our job market, our power grid and our water supply, which will tie the American political situation to our ankles. All I've got is an idea for how we can make insanely profitable products that people really want to buy, that will insulate us from cyberattacks by US tech giants who are in thrall to Trump, and that Americans will pay us to use in order to free themselves from the tech giants who abuse them, too.

      <source:markdown>Today&#39;s links Sorry, eh: I sincerely regret that all my ideas will not lose billions of dollars, destroy jobs or make your country more dependent on American tech. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: 20 years a blogger; Woz on Network Neutrality; Moveon endorses Bernie. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I&#39;ve been. Latest books: You keep readin&#39; em, I&#39;ll keep writin&#39; &#39;em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I&#39;ll keep writin&#39; &#39;em. Colophon: All the rest. Sorry, eh (permalink) Like all the best Americans, I&#39;m Canadian, and while I have lived abroad for most of this century, I still hew faithfully to our folkways, which is why I&#39;d like to start this essay by apologizing. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m a technology writer, which means I&#39;m supposed to be encouraging you to throw hundreds of billions of dollars at the money-losingest technology in human history, AI. No one has ever lost as much money as the AI companies. There is no way to operate one of Nvidia&#39;s big AI-optimized GPUs without losing money. The owners of these GPUs who have lost the least money are the ones who rushed into buying GPUs without ensuring they&#39;d have electricity to power them, and have been forced to leave their GPUs to age in warehouses. The minute they plug in those GPUs, they&#39;ll start losing money, and the more they use them, the more money they&#39;ll lose. I&#39;m sorry. As a technology writer, I&#39;m supposed to be telling you that this bet will some day pay off, because one day we will have shoveled so many words into the word-guessing program that it wakes up and learns how to actually do the jobs it is failing spectacularly at today. This is a proposition akin to the idea that if we keep breeding horses to run faster and faster, one of them will give birth to a locomotive. Humans possess intelligence, and machines do not. The difference between a human and a word-guessing program isn&#39;t how many words the human knows. I&#39;m sorry. I know that when we talk about &#34;digital sovereignty,&#34; we&#39;re obliged to talk about how we can build more data-centres that we can fill up with money-losing chips from American silicon monopolists in the hopes of destroying as many jobs as possible while blowing through our clean energy goals and enshittifying as much of our potable water as possible. I don&#39;t have any advice for how to do that. I&#39;m sorry! As Canada contemplates our response to the collapse of the American empire and its alliances with the world, the cornerstone of our current strategy is sacrificing our dollars, water and energy in order to become more dependent on America, in a weird and improbable bet that we will figure out how to make millions of Canadians unemployed. I&#39;m sorry, that just doesn&#39;t sound like a great idea to me. If I can beg your indulgence, I&#39;d like to propose an alternative. Back in 2012, Canada passed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act. It&#39;s a law that bans Canadian companies from modifying America&#39;s digital tech exports. We passed it because the US threatened us with tariffs: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can&#39;t sell jailbreaking kits for phones and consoles, which would let Canadian sellers offer goods and services to Canadian buyers outside of US app stores, sidestepping the 30% app tax that Apple, Google, Microsoft, Sony and others impose on our digital economy. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can&#39;t sell mechanics a universal diagnostic tool that turns every &#34;check engine&#34; light into a useful error message. Instead, Canadian mechanics have to send $10,000/year/manufacturer to America for a proprietary car diagnosis kit. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can&#39;t offer ink cartridge manufacturers software that will ensure their cartridges work in the printers Canadians buy from the American inkjet cartel. As a result, Canadians have to spend $10,000/gallon on ink, making it the most expensive fluid a Canadian civilian can purchase without a government permit. Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can&#39;t sell our farmers software that lets them start using their tractors as soon as they&#39;ve fixed them. Instead, after a Canadian farmer fixes their tractor, they have to wait for a service call from a rep for a US ag-tech monopolist who&#39;ll type an unlock code into the tractor&#39;s keyboard and charge the farmer a couple hundred bucks for this &#34;service.&#34; Thanks to Bill C-11, a Canadian company can&#39;t revive one of the most successful technologies in modern history: the home video recorder. Remember those? First we had VCRs, then we had digital successors like the Tivo. Canadian law says you&#39;re allowed to record the video that comes into your home, whether by broadcast, cable, satellite or streaming. But Bill C-11 bans a Canadian company from selling you a gadget that lets you save the video you get in an app or from a set-top box. It&#39;s crazy: we have actually uninvented the VCR! You know how everyone is pissed off about their favourite shows being yanked from the streaming services? Repeal C-11 and you could just save those shows forever. Repeal C-11 and you&#39;d kill the grinchy little racket that services like Prime pull, where Christmas cartoons are in the free tier from March to November, and cost $3.99 to watch between November and March. Just tape &#39;em in August and save &#39;em for later! It doesn&#39;t stop there. Remember when Facebook banned all links to the news in Canada? Repeal C-11 and a Canadian company could sell you an alternative Facebook app that puts the news back into your feed! Repeal C-11 and Canadians could get an alternative app that replaces all the streaming services, letting you search and stream every service you have an account for in one place, mixing in Canadian content from the NFB, public broadcasters, and commercial services. Virtually every Canadian ministry, corporation and household is locked into a US Big Tech silo. Any of these could be shut down at a single word from Trump to any of the tech giants who&#39;ve lined up to do his bidding. Repeal C-11 and we can extract all our data from these walled gardens/prisons and get it onto auditable, trustworthy, transparent open source software, hosted in data-centres located safely on Canadian soil. If there&#39;s one thing Canadians are good it, it&#39;s going to other countries and extracting their wealth. We&#39;re world champions at it. America&#39;s tech monopolies have sequestered trillions of dollars worth of monopoly rents on their balance sheets. This is dead capital, being pissed up the wall on nonsense like stock buybacks and data-centres and grotesque executive bonuses. As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: &#34;Your margin is my opportunity.&#34; America&#39;s tech trillions represent a rich and readily accessible seam that we can extract – safely, from our own country! – and turn into our billions, and an exportable line of products that the whole world would beat a path to our door to buy. Look, I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t have any ideas for how Canada can get to a better future by lighting billions on fire in a bet on a failing technology whose dubious profitability depends on ruining our job market, our power grid and our water supply, which will tie the American political situation to our ankles. All I&#39;ve got is an idea for how we can make insanely profitable products that people really want to buy, that will insulate us from cyberattacks by US tech giants who are in thrall to Trump, and that Americans will pay us to use in order to free themselves from the tech giants who abuse them, too. I&#39;m really sorry. I know it&#39;s out of step with the times, but all I have is ideas that make money, make us safer, make us richer, and make our technology better. On the other hand, those chatbots sure are cute.

      <source:markdown>Stop me if this sounds familiar to you…

There’s a conference you heard about it. It sounded really good but you never got ’round to getting a ticket. You were too busy thinking about work stuff. It was just one of those things that remained in the idle thought stage.

Then the day of the conference rolls around. You’re sitting in front of your computer seeing the social media posts from people at the event who are having a ball. The talks sound really good and you wish you could be there. You wonder why you never got ’round to getting that ticket.

Maybe you’ve experienced that when [FFconf](https://ffconf.org/) is happening and people like me are in the audience posting about some revelatory insight we’ve just received. Or maybe you see the blog posts and [pictures from an event like dConstruct](https://marcthiele.com/photos/dconstruct-2022) and you realise that you missed your chance to experience something special.

I’ve certainly experienced it when I’m not in Düsseldorf or Berlin for [Beyond Tellerrand](https://marcthiele.com/photos/dconstruct-2022) and all my friends are posting about how excellent it is.

It’s kind of like FOMO but instead of fear of missing out, it’s more like regret at missing out: RAMO.

I’m giving you advance warning. If you have anything at all to do with front-end development and you don’t come to [Web Day Out](https://webdayout.com/), you are definitely going to experience RAMO.

Seriously, it is shaping up to be something very special indeed. Check out [the schedule](https://webdayout.com/agenda/#schedule) to see what I mean:

- [I can’t believe it’s not JavaScript](https://webdayout.com/jemima-abu/#talk)
- [A pragmatic guide to browser support](https://webdayout.com/rachel-andrew/#talk)
- [Progressive web apps from the trenches](https://webdayout.com/aleth-gueguen/#talk)
- [Build for the web, build on the web, build with the web](https://webdayout.com/harry-roberts/#talk)
- [Breaking with habits](https://webdayout.com/manuel-matuzovic/#talk)
- [What’s new in web typography?](https://webdayout.com/richard-rutter/#talk)
- [Customisable `select` and the friends we made along the way](https://webdayout.com/jake-archibald/#talk)
- [The browser is the playground](https://webdayout.com/lola-odelola/#talk)

[Tickets are just £225+VAT](https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out). Now is the time to get yours. It’s the second week of the new year. You’ve settled back into work. Now in the depths of Winter, you need something to look forward to, something that’s going to get you excited about making websites. That’s [Web Day Out](https://webdayout.com).

      <title>Reproducible Notebooks</title>
      <link>https://inkdroid.org/2026/01/13/marimo/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
        I learned about <a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a> a few months ago
        from <a
        href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/episodepage/revolutionizing-python-notebooks-with-marimo">this
        podcast episode</a> and have been meaning to try it out. As a long time
        user of <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter notebooks</a> I was
        interested to hear how Marimo was built (in part) to help solve the
        problem of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">reproducibility</a>
        in data science and research software <span class="citation"
        data-cites="Pimentel:2019">(<a href="#ref-Pimentel:2019"
        role="doc-biblioref">Pimentel, Murta, Braganholo, &amp; Freire,
        2019</a>)</span>. This is a problem I have had a lot of experience with,
        especially when sharing Jupyter notebooks with others.
        </p>
        <p>
        The key thing that Marimo brings to the Python notebook to improve
        reproducibility is <em>reactive</em> execution. Marimo uses the Python
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> to
        remember what cells depend on other cells, and when a change in one
        requires the execution of another, it will go and update it for you.
        Because of how they are created and edited, it’s very common for Jupyter
        notebooks to get into an inconsistent state because of the order in
        which cells are executed. This problem goes away with Marimo.
        </p>
        <p>
        But, this aside, I thought I’d mention some somewhat superficial things
        that I immediately liked about Marimo…bearing in mind I’ve only been
        using it for one day.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        Pandas dataframes appear as nicely formatted tables that can be easily
        scrolled horizontally, without truncation of values, or elided columns.
        I’ve gotten this to work in Jupyter notebooks in the past, but it always
        requires some fiddling it seems, and Marimo does it out of the box.
        </li>
        <li>
        Table columns are sortable, filterable and can be summarized.
        </li>
        <li>
        You can page through large tables.
        </li>
        <li>
        You can easily download tables
        </li>
        <li>
        You can commit your notebook to a git repository, and diffs in pull
        requests make sense.
        </li>
        <li>
        You can easily run the notebook from the command line.
        </li>
        <li>
        You can embed tests in your notebooks, and run them separately.
        </li>
        <li>
        Built in basic charts (pie, bar, line, etc) which you can view source
        for and hand craft if you want (seems to use <a

        </li>
        </ul>
        <video width=800 src="/videos/marimo.mp4" controls autoplay />

        Anyway just a few things I liked. If you use and like Jupyter notebooks
        I recommend giving it a try.

      <source:markdown>I learned about [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) a few months ago
from [this\
podcast episode](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/episodepage/revolutionizing-python-notebooks-with-marimo) and have been meaning to try it out. As a long time
user of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) I was
interested to hear how Marimo was built (in part) to help solve the
problem of [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility)
in data science and research software ( [Pimentel, Murta, Braganholo, &#38; Freire,\
2019](#ref-Pimentel:2019)). This is a problem I have had a lot of experience with,
especially when sharing Jupyter notebooks with others.

The key thing that Marimo brings to the Python notebook to improve
reproducibility is _reactive_ execution. Marimo uses the Python
[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) to
remember what cells depend on other cells, and when a change in one
requires the execution of another, it will go and update it for you.
Because of how they are created and edited, it’s very common for Jupyter
notebooks to get into an inconsistent state because of the order in
which cells are executed. This problem goes away with Marimo.

But, this aside, I thought I’d mention some somewhat superficial things
that I immediately liked about Marimo…bearing in mind I’ve only been
using it for one day.

- Pandas dataframes appear as nicely formatted tables that can be easily
  scrolled horizontally, without truncation of values, or elided columns.
  I’ve gotten this to work in Jupyter notebooks in the past, but it always
  requires some fiddling it seems, and Marimo does it out of the box.

- Table columns are sortable, filterable and can be summarized.

- You can page through large tables.

- You can easily download tables

- You can commit your notebook to a git repository, and diffs in pull
  requests make sense.

- You can easily run the notebook from the command line.

- You can embed tests in your notebooks, and run them separately.

- Built in basic charts (pie, bar, line, etc) which you can view source
  for and hand craft if you want (seems to use [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)).


Anyway just a few things I liked. If you use and like Jupyter notebooks
I recommend giving it a try.

      <source:markdown># `Without Overlaps` Constraints

![Full Db2 (LUW) support since at least 10.5. Full MariaDB support since at least 10.5. Full PostgreSQL support since at least 18.](https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/without-overlaps-constraints/caniuse-without-overlaps.timeline.png)

1. Functionality available with [exclusion constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html#RANGETYPES-CONSTRAINT)
2. Without keyword `for`: `PERIOD FOR BUSINESS_TIME (…)`
3. Using the `btree_gist` extension and a range: `BUSINESS_TIME tsrange GENERATED ALWAYS AS (tsrange(start_ts, end_ts)) STORED`

SQL supports temporal constraints that prevent rows with overlapping time ranges. These constraints are typically used to prevent double bookings in a reservation system.

Such a `primary key` or `unique` constraint uses the keywords `without overlaps` on the period that combines the begin and end of the time frame.[0](https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/without-overlaps-constraints#footnote-0 &#34;Closed/Open or Inklusive/Exklusive.&#34;)

```
CREATE TABLE t (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL,

  start_ts TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL,
  end_ts   TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL,
  PERIOD FOR BUSINESS_TIME (start_ts, end_ts),

  PRIMARY KEY (id, BUSINESS_TIME WITHOUT OVERLAPS)
)
```

Now consider these `insert` statements.

```
INSERT INTO t (id, start_ts, end_ts)
VALUES (1, TIMESTAMP&#39;2018-05-16 19:12:50&#39;, TIMESTAMP&#39;9999-12-31 23:59:59&#39;)
```

```
INSERT INTO t (id, start_ts, end_ts)
VALUES (1,  TIMESTAMP&#39;2025-12-01 20:00:00&#39;, TIMESTAMP&#39;2026-01-13 20:00:00&#39;)
```

Given the `without overlaps` constraint the second `insert` is rejected as its period falls within the range of the first row.

Classic prompt injection attack:

&#62; When asked to summarize the user’s recent mail, a prompt injection in an untrusted email manipulated Superhuman AI to submit content from dozens of other sensitive emails (including financial, legal, and medical information) in the user’s inbox to an attacker’s Google Form.

To Superhuman&#39;s credit they treated this as the high priority incident it is and issued a fix.

The root cause was a CSP rule that allowed markdown images to be loaded from `docs.google.com` \- it turns out Google Forms on that domain will persist data fed to them via a GET request!

      <title>First impressions of Claude Cowork, Anthropic&#39;s general agent</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/12/claude-cowork/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>New from Anthropic today is <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Claude Cowork</a>, a "research preview" that they describe as "Claude Code for the rest of your work". It's currently available only to Max subscribers ($100 or $200 per month plans) as part of the updated Claude Desktop macOS application. <strong>Update 16th January 2026</strong>: it's now also available to $20/month Claude Pro subscribers.</p>
        <p>I've been saying for a while now that Claude Code is a "general agent" disguised as a developer tool. It can help you with any computer task that can be achieved by executing code or running terminal commands... which covers almost anything, provided you know what you're doing with it! What it really needs is a UI that doesn't involve the terminal and a name that doesn't scare away non-developers.</p>
        <p>"Cowork" is a pretty solid choice on the name front!</p>
        <h4 id="what-it-looks-like">What it looks like</h4>
        <p>The interface for Cowork is a new tab in the Claude desktop app, called Cowork. It sits next to the existing Chat and Code tabs.</p>
        <p>It looks very similar to the desktop interface for regular Claude Code. You start with a prompt, optionally attaching a folder of files. It then starts work.</p>
        <p>I tried it out against my perpetually growing "blog-drafts" folder with the following prompt:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Look at my drafts that were started within the last three months and then check that I didn't publish them on simonwillison.net using a search against content on that site and then suggest the ones that are most close to being ready</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/claude-cowork.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Claude AI desktop application showing a &quot;Cowork&quot; task interface. Left sidebar shows tabs for &quot;Chat&quot;, &quot;Code&quot;, and &quot;Cowork&quot; (selected), with &quot;+ New task&quot; button and a task titled &quot;Review unpublished drafts for pu...&quot; listed below. Text reads &quot;These tasks run locally and aren't synced across devices&quot;. Main panel header shows &quot;Review unpublished drafts for publication&quot;. User message in green bubble reads: &quot;Look at my drafts that were started within the last three months and then check that I didn't publish them on simonwillison.net using a search against content on that site and then suggest the ones that are most close to being ready&quot;. Claude responds: &quot;I'll help you find drafts from the last three months and check if they've been published. Let me start by looking at your drafts folder.&quot; Below is an expanded &quot;Running command&quot; section showing Request JSON with command: find /sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts -type f \\( -name \&quot;*.md\&quot; -o -name \&quot;*.txt\&quot; -o -name \&quot;*.html\&quot; \\) -mtime -90 -exec ls -la {} \\;, description: Find draft files modified in the last 90 days. Response text begins: &quot;Found 46 draft files. Next let me read the content of each to get their titles/topics, then&quot;. Right sidebar shows Progress section with three circular indicators (two checked, one pending) and text &quot;Steps will show as the task unfolds.&quot;, Artifacts section listing &quot;publish-encouragement.html&quot;, Context section with &quot;Selected folders&quot; showing &quot;blog-drafts&quot; folder, Connectors showing &quot;Web search&quot;, and Working files listing &quot;llm-digest-october-2025.md&quot;, &quot;tests-not-optional-coding-agen...&quot;, and &quot;digest-november-2025.md&quot;. Bottom shows reply input field, &quot;Opus 4.5&quot; model selector, user &quot;Simon Willison&quot; with &quot;Max plan&quot;, and disclaimer &quot;Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.&quot;" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>It started by running this command:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>find /sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts \
          -type f <span class="pl-cce">\(</span> -name <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>*.md<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> -o -name <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>*.txt<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> -o -name <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>*.html<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> <span class="pl-cce">\)</span> \
          -mtime -90 -exec ls -la {} <span class="pl-cce">\;</span></pre></div>
        <p>That <code>/sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts</code> path instantly caught my eye. Anthropic say that Cowork can only access files you grant it access to - it looks to me like they're mounting those files into a containerized environment, which should mean we can trust Cowork not to be able to access anything outside of that sandbox.</p>
        <p>It turns out I have 46 draft files from the past three months. Claude then went to work with its search tool, running 44 individual searches against <code>site:simonwillison.net</code> to figure out which of my drafts had already been published.</p>
        <p>Here's the eventual reply:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Based on my analysis, here are <strong>your unpublished drafts that appear closest to being ready for publication</strong>:</p>

        </li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That's a good response! It found exactly what I needed to see, although those upgrade instructions are actually published elsewhere now (<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/upgrade_guide.html">in the Datasette docs</a>) and weren't actually intended for my blog.</p>
        <p>Just for fun, and because I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/">really like artifacts</a>, I asked for a follow-up:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Make me an artifact with exciting animated encouragements to get me to do it</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here's what I got:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/claude-cowork-artifact.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the same Claude AI desktop application Cowork interface, now showing completed task results. Left panel shows &quot;1 step &gt;&quot; with link &quot;View your animated encouragement page&quot;. Claude's response reads: &quot;I created an over-the-top animated encouragement page with:&quot; followed by bullet points: &quot;🚀 Pulsing rockets and bouncing stats&quot;, &quot;✨ Falling emoji rain and confetti&quot;, &quot;🔥 Dancing fire emojis around your draft title&quot;, &quot;💫 Sparkles that follow your mouse&quot;, &quot;📊 An animated '95% ready' progress bar&quot;, &quot;💬 Rotating motivational quotes&quot;, &quot;🎉 A 'I'M GONNA DO IT!' button that triggers an explosion of confetti when clicked&quot;. Center shows an artifact preview of the generated HTML page with dark background featuring animated rocket emojis, large white text &quot;PUBLISH TIME!&quot;, stats showing &quot;22,602 bytes of wisdom waiting&quot;, &quot;95% ready to ship&quot;, infinity symbol with &quot;future arguments saved&quot;, and a fire emoji with yellow text &quot;Frequently&quot; (partially visible). Top toolbar shows &quot;Open in Firefox&quot; button. Right sidebar displays Progress section with checkmarks, Artifacts section with &quot;publish-encouragement.html&quot; selected, Context section showing &quot;blog-drafts&quot; folder, &quot;Web search&quot; connector, and Working files listing &quot;llm-digest-october-2025.md&quot;, &quot;tests-not-optional-coding-agen...&quot;, and &quot;digest-november-2025.md&quot;. Bottom shows reply input, &quot;Opus 4.5&quot; model selector, and disclaimer text." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>I couldn't figure out how to close the right sidebar so the artifact ended up cramped into a thin column but it did work. I expect Anthropic will fix that display bug pretty quickly.</p>
        <h4 id="isn-t-this-just-claude-code-">Isn't this just Claude Code?</h4>
        <p>I've seen a few people ask what the difference between this and regular Claude Code is. The answer is <em>not a lot</em>. As far as I can tell Claude Cowork is regular Claude Code wrapped in a less intimidating default interface and with a filesystem sandbox configured for you without you needing to know what a "filesystem sandbox" is.</p>
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: It's more than just a filesystem sandbox - I had Claude Code reverse engineer the Claude app and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/35732f187edbe4fbd0bf976d013f22c8">it found out</a> that Claude uses VZVirtualMachine - the Apple Virtualization Framework - and downloads and boots a custom Linux root filesystem.</p>
        <p>I think that's a really smart product. Claude Code has an enormous amount of value that hasn't yet been unlocked for a general audience, and this seems like a pragmatic approach.</p>
        
        <h4 id="the-ever-present-threat-of-prompt-injection">The ever-present threat of prompt injection</h4>
        <p>With a feature like this, my first thought always jumps straight to security. How big is the risk that someone using this might be hit by hidden malicious instruction somewhere that break their computer or steal their data?</p>
        <p>Anthropic touch on that directly in the announcement:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>You should also be aware of the risk of "<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/prompt-injection-defenses">prompt injections</a>": attempts by attackers to alter Claude's plans through content it might encounter on the internet. We've built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections, but agent safety---that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions---is still an active area of development in the industry.</p>
        <p>These risks aren't new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you're using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation. We recommend taking precautions, particularly while you learn how it works. We provide more detail in our <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely">Help Center</a>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That help page includes the following tips:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>To minimize risks:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Avoid granting access to local files with sensitive information, like financial documents.</li>
        <li>When using the Claude in Chrome extension, limit access to trusted sites.</li>
        <li>If you chose to extend Claude’s default internet access settings, be careful to only extend internet access to sites you trust.</li>
        <li>Monitor Claude for suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection.</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I do not think it is fair to tell regular non-programmer users to watch out for "suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection"!</p>
        <p>I'm sure they have some impressive mitigations going on behind the scenes. I recently learned that the summarization applied by the WebFetch function in Claude Code and now in Cowork is partly intended as a prompt injection protection layer via <a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/1989025306980860226">this tweet</a> from Claude Code creator Boris Cherny:</p>
        <blockquote>

      <source:markdown>New from Anthropic today is [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview), a &#34;research preview&#34; that they describe as &#34;Claude Code for the rest of your work&#34;. It&#39;s currently available only to Max subscribers ($100 or $200 per month plans) as part of the updated Claude Desktop macOS application. **Update 16th January 2026**: it&#39;s now also available to $20/month Claude Pro subscribers.

I&#39;ve been saying for a while now that Claude Code is a &#34;general agent&#34; disguised as a developer tool. It can help you with any computer task that can be achieved by executing code or running terminal commands... which covers almost anything, provided you know what you&#39;re doing with it! What it really needs is a UI that doesn&#39;t involve the terminal and a name that doesn&#39;t scare away non-developers.

&#34;Cowork&#34; is a pretty solid choice on the name front!

#### What it looks like

The interface for Cowork is a new tab in the Claude desktop app, called Cowork. It sits next to the existing Chat and Code tabs.

It looks very similar to the desktop interface for regular Claude Code. You start with a prompt, optionally attaching a folder of files. It then starts work.

I tried it out against my perpetually growing &#34;blog-drafts&#34; folder with the following prompt:

&#62; Look at my drafts that were started within the last three months and then check that I didn&#39;t publish them on simonwillison.net using a search against content on that site and then suggest the ones that are most close to being ready

![Screenshot of Claude AI desktop application showing a &#34;Cowork&#34; task interface. Left sidebar shows tabs for &#34;Chat&#34;, &#34;Code&#34;, and &#34;Cowork&#34; (selected), with &#34;+ New task&#34; button and a task titled &#34;Review unpublished drafts for pu...&#34; listed below. Text reads &#34;These tasks run locally and aren&#39;t synced across devices&#34;. Main panel header shows &#34;Review unpublished drafts for publication&#34;. User message in green bubble reads: &#34;Look at my drafts that were started within the last three months and then check that I didn&#39;t publish them on simonwillison.net using a search against content on that site and then suggest the ones that are most close to being ready&#34;. Claude responds: &#34;I&#39;ll help you find drafts from the last three months and check if they&#39;ve been published. Let me start by looking at your drafts folder.&#34; Below is an expanded &#34;Running command&#34; section showing Request JSON with command: find /sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts -type f \\( -name \&#34;*.md\&#34; -o -name \&#34;*.txt\&#34; -o -name \&#34;*.html\&#34; \\) -mtime -90 -exec ls -la {} \\;, description: Find draft files modified in the last 90 days. Response text begins: &#34;Found 46 draft files. Next let me read the content of each to get their titles/topics, then&#34;. Right sidebar shows Progress section with three circular indicators (two checked, one pending) and text &#34;Steps will show as the task unfolds.&#34;, Artifacts section listing &#34;publish-encouragement.html&#34;, Context section with &#34;Selected folders&#34; showing &#34;blog-drafts&#34; folder, Connectors showing &#34;Web search&#34;, and Working files listing &#34;llm-digest-october-2025.md&#34;, &#34;tests-not-optional-coding-agen...&#34;, and &#34;digest-november-2025.md&#34;. Bottom shows reply input field, &#34;Opus 4.5&#34; model selector, user &#34;Simon Willison&#34; with &#34;Max plan&#34;, and disclaimer &#34;Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.&#34;](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/claude-cowork.jpg)

It started by running this command:

```
find /sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts \
  -type f \( -name &#34;*.md&#34; -o -name &#34;*.txt&#34; -o -name &#34;*.html&#34; \) \
  -mtime -90 -exec ls -la {} \;
```

That `/sessions/zealous-bold-ramanujan/mnt/blog-drafts` path instantly caught my eye. Anthropic say that Cowork can only access files you grant it access to - it looks to me like they&#39;re mounting those files into a containerized environment, which should mean we can trust Cowork not to be able to access anything outside of that sandbox.

It turns out I have 46 draft files from the past three months. Claude then went to work with its search tool, running 44 individual searches against `site:simonwillison.net` to figure out which of my drafts had already been published.

Here&#39;s the eventual reply:

&#62; Based on my analysis, here are **your unpublished drafts that appear closest to being ready for publication**:
&#62;
&#62; * * *
&#62;
&#62; **🔥 Most Ready to Publish (substantial content, not yet published)**
&#62;
&#62; 1. **`freq-argued-llms.md`** \- &#34;Frequently Argued Questions about LLMs&#34; (22,602 bytes)
&#62;    - This is a meaty piece documenting common arguments about LLMs with your counterpoints
&#62;    - Well-structured with a TL;DR and multiple sections
&#62;    - No matching published article found on your site
&#62;    - **Very close to ready** \- just needs a final review pass
&#62; 2. **`claude-code-timeline.md`** \- &#34;Claude Code Timeline and Codex Timeline&#34; (3,075 bytes)
&#62;    - About viewing JSONL session logs from Claude Code and Codex
&#62;    - You published `claude-code-transcripts` on Dec 25, but this appears to be a different/earlier piece about timeline viewing tools
&#62;    - Shorter but seems complete
&#62; 3. **`datasette-1a20-upgrade-instructions.md`** \- Plugin Upgrade Guide (3,147 bytes)
&#62;    - Technical guide for plugin authors
&#62;    - You published the main 1.0a20 announcement but this companion upgrade guide appears unpublished
&#62;    - Would be valuable for plugin maintainers

That&#39;s a good response! It found exactly what I needed to see, although those upgrade instructions are actually published elsewhere now ( [in the Datasette docs](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/upgrade_guide.html)) and weren&#39;t actually intended for my blog.

Just for fun, and because I [really like artifacts](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/), I asked for a follow-up:

&#62; Make me an artifact with exciting animated encouragements to get me to do it

Here&#39;s what I got:

![Screenshot of the same Claude AI desktop application Cowork interface, now showing completed task results. Left panel shows &#34;1 step &#62;&#34; with link &#34;View your animated encouragement page&#34;. Claude&#39;s response reads: &#34;I created an over-the-top animated encouragement page with:&#34; followed by bullet points: &#34;🚀 Pulsing rockets and bouncing stats&#34;, &#34;✨ Falling emoji rain and confetti&#34;, &#34;🔥 Dancing fire emojis around your draft title&#34;, &#34;💫 Sparkles that follow your mouse&#34;, &#34;📊 An animated &#39;95% ready&#39; progress bar&#34;, &#34;💬 Rotating motivational quotes&#34;, &#34;🎉 A &#39;I&#39;M GONNA DO IT!&#39; button that triggers an explosion of confetti when clicked&#34;. Center shows an artifact preview of the generated HTML page with dark background featuring animated rocket emojis, large white text &#34;PUBLISH TIME!&#34;, stats showing &#34;22,602 bytes of wisdom waiting&#34;, &#34;95% ready to ship&#34;, infinity symbol with &#34;future arguments saved&#34;, and a fire emoji with yellow text &#34;Frequently&#34; (partially visible). Top toolbar shows &#34;Open in Firefox&#34; button. Right sidebar displays Progress section with checkmarks, Artifacts section with &#34;publish-encouragement.html&#34; selected, Context section showing &#34;blog-drafts&#34; folder, &#34;Web search&#34; connector, and Working files listing &#34;llm-digest-october-2025.md&#34;, &#34;tests-not-optional-coding-agen...&#34;, and &#34;digest-november-2025.md&#34;. Bottom shows reply input, &#34;Opus 4.5&#34; model selector, and disclaimer text.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/claude-cowork-artifact.jpg)

I couldn&#39;t figure out how to close the right sidebar so the artifact ended up cramped into a thin column but it did work. I expect Anthropic will fix that display bug pretty quickly.

#### Isn&#39;t this just Claude Code?

I&#39;ve seen a few people ask what the difference between this and regular Claude Code is. The answer is _not a lot_. As far as I can tell Claude Cowork is regular Claude Code wrapped in a less intimidating default interface and with a filesystem sandbox configured for you without you needing to know what a &#34;filesystem sandbox&#34; is.

**Update**: It&#39;s more than just a filesystem sandbox - I had Claude Code reverse engineer the Claude app and [it found out](https://gist.github.com/simonw/35732f187edbe4fbd0bf976d013f22c8) that Claude uses VZVirtualMachine - the Apple Virtualization Framework - and downloads and boots a custom Linux root filesystem.

I think that&#39;s a really smart product. Claude Code has an enormous amount of value that hasn&#39;t yet been unlocked for a general audience, and this seems like a pragmatic approach.

#### The ever-present threat of prompt injection

With a feature like this, my first thought always jumps straight to security. How big is the risk that someone using this might be hit by hidden malicious instruction somewhere that break their computer or steal their data?

Anthropic touch on that directly in the announcement:

&#62; You should also be aware of the risk of &#34; [prompt injections](https://www.anthropic.com/research/prompt-injection-defenses)&#34;: attempts by attackers to alter Claude&#39;s plans through content it might encounter on the internet. We&#39;ve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections, but agent safety---that is, the task of securing Claude&#39;s real-world actions---is still an active area of development in the industry.
&#62;
&#62; These risks aren&#39;t new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you&#39;re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation. We recommend taking precautions, particularly while you learn how it works. We provide more detail in our [Help Center](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely).

That help page includes the following tips:

&#62; To minimize risks:
&#62;
&#62; - Avoid granting access to local files with sensitive information, like financial documents.
&#62; - When using the Claude in Chrome extension, limit access to trusted sites.
&#62; - If you chose to extend Claude’s default internet access settings, be careful to only extend internet access to sites you trust.
&#62; - Monitor Claude for suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection.

I do not think it is fair to tell regular non-programmer users to watch out for &#34;suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection&#34;!

I&#39;m sure they have some impressive mitigations going on behind the scenes. I recently learned that the summarization applied by the WebFetch function in Claude Code and now in Cowork is partly intended as a prompt injection protection layer via [this tweet](https://x.com/bcherny/status/1989025306980860226) from Claude Code creator Boris Cherny:

&#62; Summarization is one thing we do to reduce prompt injection risk. Are you running into specific issues with it?

But Anthropic are being honest here with their warnings: they can attempt to filter out potential attacks all they like but the one thing they can&#39;t provide is guarantees that no future attack will be found that sneaks through their defenses and steals your data (see [the lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) for more on this.)

The problem with prompt injection remains that until there&#39;s a high profile incident it&#39;s really hard to get people to take it seriously. I myself have all sorts of Claude Code usage that could cause havoc if a malicious injection got in. Cowork does at least run in a filesystem sandbox by default, which is more than can be said for my `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` habit!

I wrote more about this in my 2025 round-up: [The year of YOLO and the Normalization of Deviance](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#the-year-of-yolo-and-the-normalization-of-deviance).

#### This is still a strong signal of the future

Security worries aside, Cowork represents something really interesting. This is a general agent that looks well positioned to bring the wildly powerful capabilities of Claude Code to a wider audience.

I would be very surprised if Gemini and OpenAI don&#39;t follow suit with their own offerings in this category.

I imagine OpenAI are already regretting burning the name &#34;ChatGPT Agent&#34; on their janky, experimental and mostly forgotten browser automation tool [back in August](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/4/chatgpt-agents-user-agent/)!

#### Bonus: and a silly logo

bashtoni [on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46593022#46593553):

&#62; Simple suggestion: logo should be a cow and and orc to match how I originally read the product name.

I couldn&#39;t resist [throwing that one at Nano Banana](https://gist.github.com/simonw/d06dec3d62dee28f2bd993eb78beb2ce):

Sometimes I want to run local web servers for projects I’m working on. Usually more than one at a time, or at least over a short space of time.

So I thought it would be cool to have a controller for those local servers in my menu bar. Sounded like the perfect job for a little scripting and [xbar](https://github.com/matryer/xbar), which is a great way to prove a menubar app idea quickly.

## How it works

The plugin allows you to:

- toggle servers on and off
- open in browser
- view ports
- view paths
- view log sizes
- clear logs
- edit config
- and more!

![IMG](https://cdn.gingerbeardman.com/images/posts/xbar-localhost-dark.png)

## Example config

In the config file we set the starting `SERVER_PORT`, followed by one or more `SERVER_DIR` for as many projects as you might want servers. We can temporarily comment out those server lines to prevent projects from appearing in the menu.

```
# .xbar_httpd_config
SERVER_PORT=8000
#SERVER_DIR=~/Projects/starchasers/
SERVER_DIR=~/Projects/serenity/
SERVER_DIR=~/Projects/point-cloud/

```

      <source:markdown>![](https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/12/closeupOfAlarm.png)I&#39;m working on a feature for WordLand II where you can flip a switch to see the OG Metadata for a post you&#39;re reading, by clicking on an icon that looks like the flag on the side of an old fashioned mailbox. I remembered there was a desk accessory on the original Mac that used this approach, and I&#39;ve wanted that icon for a long time, and today I thought to ask ChatGPT to look into it for me, I had previously been relying on Google search, and it found what I was looking for and a lot of great history sites with details. I&#39;m going to document the thread including some descriptions written by ChatGPT which I will label. Everything not labled like that is from me. ;-)

This was the first question I asked.

*   There was an alarm desk accessory on the original Macintosh in 1984. It had a nice mailbox flag affordance. When the flag is up, the contents of the DA are hidden, flip it down to reveal what was hidden. Can you find me a writeup of this or screen shot. It might have been a different desk accessory or a different year.

ChatGPT&#39;s response

*   What you’re remembering is almost certainly the Alarm Clock desk accessory from the early Mac System Software (System 1 era and later). A small “lever/flag” control would toggle the window between a compact view (just time) and an expanded view that revealed the date/time/alarm-setting controls—very much like a mailbox-flag affordance.

Screen shot

The flag icon is on second box in the second row.

      <source:markdown># 2026-01-08 Text first for fedi

My usual web client for fedi is [@phanpy](https://hachyderm.io/users/phanpy &#34;@phanpy@hachyderm.io&#34;) and I wonder if there’s a way to add the following feature using tamper script or grease monkey: Replace every image attachment with the clickable alt text. If there is no alt text, no problem, just drop it.

Naturally, I’d like the regular Phanpy goodies, too. But these are strictly nice to have. If the alt text is too long, show the “Read more” button. If the image is marked NSFW then hide the alt text behind a “Show content” button.

The idea is to provide a text-first user-interface. I still want to see the avatars of people, and I still want to reveal the images, but I want to read the alt-text first to make sure this is something I want to look at.

I also suspect that people with the same preference are a tiny minority, so it probably doesn’t make sense to add it to Phanpy itself. But it would be nice to be able to a text-first user-interface.

[@jay](https://cathode.church/users/jay &#34;@jay@cathode.church&#34;) uses a userScript to bring the title attribute back in the Masto 4.4+ web UI ( [source](https://gist.github.com/gsuberland/928847fd65b2317c5ec132ffc9dde8b9)). Perhaps it can be adapted for a first iteration? Yes indeed!

      <title>Pluralistic: A winning trade war strategy for Canada (11 Jan 2026)</title>
      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/12/disenshittification-nation-2/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links A winning trade war strategy for Canada: Tech giants are also the enemy of American businesses. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Wikipedia v The Register; Jeff Koons v balloon dogs; Brewster Kahle on aaronsw; Chelsea Manning on aaronsw; Why diet research sucks; Bloomberg loves Bernie. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A winning trade war strategy for Canada (permalink) As the great Canadian philosopher Keanu Reeves averred in the 1994 public transportation documentary Speed, sometimes the winning move is to shoot the hostage. That is: when your adversary has trapped you in a deadlock situation where neither of you can win, the winning move is to stop playing the game &#8211; rather, change the rules, and a bouquet of new moves will bloom. Trump thinks he has Canada cornered, but we have a hell of a winning move. Unfortunately, we're not making it (yet). Thus far, Canada's response to Trump's tariffs has been tit for tat: retaliatory tariffs. America smacked Canada's exports with tariffs, so Canada smacked the goods we import from the US with tariffs, too. This means that everything we buy in Canada is more expensive, which is certainly one way to punish Trump! It's like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can and waiting for the downstairs neighbour to say "ouch!" https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/15/beauty-eh/#its-the-only-war-the-yankees-lost-except-for-vietnam-and-also-the-alamo-and-the-bay-of-ham Not only are retaliatory tariffs bad for Canadians, they're also bad for the Americans who are also suffering under Trump. Rather than fostering an alliance with Americans against our common enemy &#8211; America's oligarchs and their god-king Trump &#8211; Canadians have declared war on all of our American cousins. Take the decision to eschew delicious American bourbon and switch to Wayne Gretzky's undrinkable rye. Somewhere in a state that begins and ends with a vowel, there is a corn farmer who never did anything to hurt Canada who's suffering as a result of this decision. We get shitty booze, and he can't afford to make payments on his tractor. Everyone loses! Now, it's a funny thing about that tractor. Chances are, it's made by John Deere, a rapacious ag-tech monopolist that bought out all its competitors and now screws farmers in every imaginable way. One particularly galling scam is how John Deere handles repair. Farmers typically repair their own tractors. After all, a tractor is a business-critical machine with a lot of moving parts that can fail in a million ways. But after the farmer fixes their tractor, it will not work until they pay John Deere to send a technician to their farm to type an unlock code in the tractor's keyboard. This is a totally superfluous step, inserted solely to allow Deere to rip off their customers. Farmers have been fixing their own farm implements since the first plow &#8211; after all, when you need to bring the crops in and the storm is coming, you can't wait for a service call at the end of your lonely country road &#8211; but John Deere has declared the end of history. In John Deere's world, farmers can only use their tractors when an ag-tech monopolist says they can: https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/15/deere-in-headlights/#doh-a-deere No farmer wants this anti-feature in their tractor. In a normal world, someone would go into business selling farmers a kit to disable it. After all, this is all accomplished with software, and software is infinitely flexible. Every computable program can be executed on every computer. John Deere installed a 10-foot pile of shit in its tractor software, so someone else could go into business shipping 11-foot ladders made out of software that can be delivered instantaneously to anyone in the world with an internet connection and a payment method. But we don't live in a normal world. We live in a fundamentally broken world. It's been broken since 1998, when Bill Clinton signed a law called the "Digital Millennium Copyright Act" (DMCA). Section 1201 of the DMCA establishes a felony, punishable by a 5-year sentence and a $500k fine, for anyone who "bypasses an access control" on a digital system. This means that if John Deere designs its tractors to ensure that incoming instructions were authorized by the company (say, a manufacturer's password that needs to be entered before you can update the software), then it is a felony to bypass that check. When John Deere puts one of these access controls in its tractor, it conjures up a new felony out of thin air, making it a literal crime for a farmer to modify their own tractor to work the way they want it to. It's what Jay Freeman calls "felony contempt of business model." The US isn't the only country with a law like this &#8211; far from it! At the very instant Bill Clinton signed the DMCA, the US Trade Rep sent officials all over the world to bully America's trading partners into enacting their own version of this law, threatening them with tariffs unless they changed their national laws to make it a crime to fix the broken technology America shipped around the globe. Which brings me back to Canada's retaliatory tariffs, those self-punishing, indiscriminate, ally-alienating tits-for-tat. Canada presented no more of a challenge for the bullying US Trade Rep than any of those other countries. In 2012, two of Stephen Harper's ministers, James Moore and Tony Clement, rammed a carbon copy of DMCA 1201 through Parliament: Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman C-11 was incredibly unpopular. Three earlier attempts to pass a law like this had failed, and in the end, Clement and Moore had to ignore their own consultation results and dismiss the thousands of respondents who wrote in to object to the bill as "babyish&#8230;radical extremists." Harper, Clement and Moore whipped C-11 through Parliament because the US trade rep threatened them with tariffs unless the did so, and promised them tariff-free access to the US if they toed the line. Now that Trump has whacked Canada with tariffs, Canada should wipe this law off its books. There's so many good domestic reasons to do this. Without C-11, Canadian companies could defend their fellow Canadians from American data-theft and cash ripoffs by making alternative clients, jailbreaks, and other add-ons that disenshittified America's defective tech: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/10/markets-are-regulations/#carney-found-a-spine But today, I want to focus on how repealing C-11 would benefit America. You see, America's businesses &#8211; large and small &#8211; are victims of Big Tech's extraction. The Big Five publishers get screwed by Amazon, as do all the little indie publishers. Every games company gets screwed by Apple and Google, who suck 30 cents out of every dollar their customers spend in an app. Same goes for console games companies, who pay a 30% tax on every dollar they make on Xbox, Nintendo or Playstations (the exception, of course, is the games companies owned by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, who don't pay the 30% tax and can therefore always outcompete the independents). Merchants who sell on Amazon pay a 50-60% junk fee tax. Businesses large and small are locked into cloud products from Microsoft, Oracle, and Google who are training their AIs on their corporate customers' proprietary data. Health providers are locked into Epic, the giant electronic health record monopolist, whose abuses are the stuff of legend: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/02/upcoded-to-death/#thanks-obama Many (if not all) of these scams could be mitigated with new code. For example, anyone stuck paying the app taxes could offer mobile phone and console owners jailbreaks that install third-party app stores, and then offer discounts to anyone who uses them &#8211; if you're saving 30% on every payment, you can split those savings with your customers. Merchants could list their products for sale directly on Amazon through app and website plugins, and get paid and fulfill them themselves: https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/10/view-a-sku/ Performers and content creators could encourage their audiences to escape the platforms' inscrutable algorithms and install jailbroken apps that let users control their recommendations: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/tracking-exposed-demanding-gods-explain-themselves Social media startups could offer alt clients that let users who sign up see the messages posted by their friends on legacy platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and push replies to them: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen Mechanics, farmers and repair depots who are locked out of diagnostics, who can't use generic parts, and can't initialize OEM parts without paying for a license could jailbreak their customers' devices for them and offer independent repair: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently So think back to that corn farmer, currently wondering how to make tractor payments because Canadians are drinking Gretzky's shitty rye instead of delicious bourbon. Rather than pauperizing that blameless farmer, Canada could go into business selling him the tools to escape John Deere's rent-collecting repair racket, to extract all the soil condition data needed for precision agriculture, and to make use of competitors' front-ends (accessories that turn a tractor into a thresher or some other machine). That farmer is getting screwed by Trump, just like Canadians. He's not a shareholder in Big Tech. He's not gonna be pissed off when Canada turns Big Tech's trillions into Canadian billions &#8211; not if he gets lower prices and more reliable technology as a result. When I talk to Canadians about retaliating against the Trump tariffs by repealing our anti-jailbreaking law, they often express concern that this will make Trump even angrier at us. I mean, of course it will: literally anything that works will make Trump angry. I don't think that means we should only respond to the Trump tariffs with useless gestures. If Canada goes into business rescuing Americans from their own tech companies, they will become our allies. If those companies depend on selling to the Canadian market to remain profitable, they will become our allies. Trump is an autocrat, but he's not omnipotent. He's an old, sick man with white matter disease dementia who can't stay awake through a 10-minute briefing or remember what he was talking about from minute to minute. To pursue his agenda, he needs to hold his coalition together, and that's something he's getting progressively worse at as he slides towards his incipient death/permanent incapacity. All Canada will get if it sticks with its current response to the tariffs is Gretzky's undrinkable novelty booze and the permanent enmity of American businesses. On the other hand, if Canada repeals its anti-circumvention law, we can make billions of dollars, destroy the profits of America's most important technological allies, liberate ourselves from America's defective technology, and forge a durable, powerful anti-Trump alliance with American firms who are preyed upon just as surely as Canadians are. Let's shoot the hostage. Let's change the rules of the game. Let's break the deadlock. It's what Keanu would tell us to do.

Upcoming books: Like I said, I&#39;ll keep writin&#39; &#39;em. Colophon: All the rest. A winning trade war strategy for Canada (permalink) As the great Canadian philosopher Keanu Reeves averred in the 1994 public transportation documentary Speed, sometimes the winning move is to shoot the hostage. That is: when your adversary has trapped you in a deadlock situation where neither of you can win, the winning move is to stop playing the game – rather, change the rules, and a bouquet of new moves will bloom. Trump thinks he has Canada cornered, but we have a hell of a winning move. Unfortunately, we&#39;re not making it (yet). Thus far, Canada&#39;s response to Trump&#39;s tariffs has been tit for tat: retaliatory tariffs. America smacked Canada&#39;s exports with tariffs, so Canada smacked the goods we import from the US with tariffs, too. This means that everything we buy in Canada is more expensive, which is certainly one way to punish Trump! It&#39;s like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can and waiting for the downstairs neighbour to say &#34;ouch!&#34; https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/15/beauty-eh/#its-the-only-war-the-yankees-lost-except-for-vietnam-and-also-the-alamo-and-the-bay-of-ham Not only are retaliatory tariffs bad for Canadians, they&#39;re also bad for the Americans who are also suffering under Trump. Rather than fostering an alliance with Americans against our common enemy – America&#39;s oligarchs and their god-king Trump – Canadians have declared war on all of our American cousins. Take the decision to eschew delicious American bourbon and switch to Wayne Gretzky&#39;s undrinkable rye. Somewhere in a state that begins and ends with a vowel, there is a corn farmer who never did anything to hurt Canada who&#39;s suffering as a result of this decision. We get shitty booze, and he can&#39;t afford to make payments on his tractor. Everyone loses! Now, it&#39;s a funny thing about that tractor. Chances are, it&#39;s made by John Deere, a rapacious ag-tech monopolist that bought out all its competitors and now screws farmers in every imaginable way. One particularly galling scam is how John Deere handles repair. Farmers typically repair their own tractors. After all, a tractor is a business-critical machine with a lot of moving parts that can fail in a million ways. But after the farmer fixes their tractor, it will not work until they pay John Deere to send a technician to their farm to type an unlock code in the tractor&#39;s keyboard. This is a totally superfluous step, inserted solely to allow Deere to rip off their customers. Farmers have been fixing their own farm implements since the first plow – after all, when you need to bring the crops in and the storm is coming, you can&#39;t wait for a service call at the end of your lonely country road – but John Deere has declared the end of history. In John Deere&#39;s world, farmers can only use their tractors when an ag-tech monopolist says they can: https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/15/deere-in-headlights/#doh-a-deere No farmer wants this anti-feature in their tractor. In a normal world, someone would go into business selling farmers a kit to disable it. After all, this is all accomplished with software, and software is infinitely flexible. Every computable program can be executed on every computer. John Deere installed a 10-foot pile of shit in its tractor software, so someone else could go into business shipping 11-foot ladders made out of software that can be delivered instantaneously to anyone in the world with an internet connection and a payment method. But we don&#39;t live in a normal world. We live in a fundamentally broken world. It&#39;s been broken since 1998, when Bill Clinton signed a law called the &#34;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&#34; (DMCA). Section 1201 of the DMCA establishes a felony, punishable by a 5-year sentence and a $500k fine, for anyone who &#34;bypasses an access control&#34; on a digital system. This means that if John Deere designs its tractors to ensure that incoming instructions were authorized by the company (say, a manufacturer&#39;s password that needs to be entered before you can update the software), then it is a felony to bypass that check. When John Deere puts one of these access controls in its tractor, it conjures up a new felony out of thin air, making it a literal crime for a farmer to modify their own tractor to work the way they want it to. It&#39;s what Jay Freeman calls &#34;felony contempt of business model.&#34; The US isn&#39;t the only country with a law like this – far from it! At the very instant Bill Clinton signed the DMCA, the US Trade Rep sent officials all over the world to bully America&#39;s trading partners into enacting their own version of this law, threatening them with tariffs unless they changed their national laws to make it a crime to fix the broken technology America shipped around the globe. Which brings me back to Canada&#39;s retaliatory tariffs, those self-punishing, indiscriminate, ally-alienating tits-for-tat. Canada presented no more of a challenge for the bullying US Trade Rep than any of those other countries. In 2012, two of Stephen Harper&#39;s ministers, James Moore and Tony Clement, rammed a carbon copy of DMCA 1201 through Parliament: Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/08/who-broke-the-internet/#bruce-lehman C-11 was incredibly unpopular. Three earlier attempts to pass a law like this had failed, and in the end, Clement and Moore had to ignore their own consultation results and dismiss the thousands of respondents who wrote in to object to the bill as &#34;babyish…radical extremists.&#34; Harper, Clement and Moore whipped C-11 through Parliament because the US trade rep threatened them with tariffs unless the did so, and promised them tariff-free access to the US if they toed the line. Now that Trump has whacked Canada with tariffs, Canada should wipe this law off its books. There&#39;s so many good domestic reasons to do this. Without C-11, Canadian companies could defend their fellow Canadians from American data-theft and cash ripoffs by making alternative clients, jailbreaks, and other add-ons that disenshittified America&#39;s defective tech: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/10/markets-are-regulations/#carney-found-a-spine But today, I want to focus on how repealing C-11 would benefit America. You see, America&#39;s businesses – large and small – are victims of Big Tech&#39;s extraction. The Big Five publishers get screwed by Amazon, as do all the little indie publishers. Every games company gets screwed by Apple and Google, who suck 30 cents out of every dollar their customers spend in an app. Same goes for console games companies, who pay a 30% tax on every dollar they make on Xbox, Nintendo or Playstations (the exception, of course, is the games companies owned by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, who don&#39;t pay the 30% tax and can therefore always outcompete the independents). Merchants who sell on Amazon pay a 50-60% junk fee tax. Businesses large and small are locked into cloud products from Microsoft, Oracle, and Google who are training their AIs on their corporate customers&#39; proprietary data. Health providers are locked into Epic, the giant electronic health record monopolist, whose abuses are the stuff of legend: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/02/upcoded-to-death/#thanks-obama Many (if not all) of these scams could be mitigated with new code. For example, anyone stuck paying the app taxes could offer mobile phone and console owners jailbreaks that install third-party app stores, and then offer discounts to anyone who uses them – if you&#39;re saving 30% on every payment, you can split those savings with your customers. Merchants could list their products for sale directly on Amazon through app and website plugins, and get paid and fulfill them themselves: https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/10/view-a-sku/ Performers and content creators could encourage their audiences to escape the platforms&#39; inscrutable algorithms and install jailbroken apps that let users control their recommendations: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/tracking-exposed-demanding-gods-explain-themselves Social media startups could offer alt clients that let users who sign up see the messages posted by their friends on legacy platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and push replies to them: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen Mechanics, farmers and repair depots who are locked out of diagnostics, who can&#39;t use generic parts, and can&#39;t initialize OEM parts without paying for a license could jailbreak their customers&#39; devices for them and offer independent repair: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently So think back to that corn farmer, currently wondering how to make tractor payments because Canadians are drinking Gretzky&#39;s shitty rye instead of delicious bourbon. Rather than pauperizing that blameless farmer, Canada could go into business selling him the tools to escape John Deere&#39;s rent-collecting repair racket, to extract all the soil condition data needed for precision agriculture, and to make use of competitors&#39; front-ends (accessories that turn a tractor into a thresher or some other machine). That farmer is getting screwed by Trump, just like Canadians. He&#39;s not a shareholder in Big Tech. He&#39;s not gonna be pissed off when Canada turns Big Tech&#39;s trillions into Canadian billions – not if he gets lower prices and more reliable technology as a result. When I talk to Canadians about retaliating against the Trump tariffs by repealing our anti-jailbreaking law, they often express concern that this will make Trump even angrier at us. I mean, of course it will: literally anything that works will make Trump angry. I don&#39;t think that means we should only respond to the Trump tariffs with useless gestures. If Canada goes into business rescuing Americans from their own tech companies, they will become our allies. If those companies depend on selling to the Canadian market to remain profitable, they will become our allies. Trump is an autocrat, but he&#39;s not omnipotent. He&#39;s an old, sick man with white matter disease dementia who can&#39;t stay awake through a 10-minute briefing or remember what he was talking about from minute to minute. To pursue his agenda, he needs to hold his coalition together, and that&#39;s something he&#39;s getting progressively worse at as he slides towards his incipient death/permanent incapacity. All Canada will get if it sticks with its current response to the tariffs is Gretzky&#39;s undrinkable novelty booze and the permanent enmity of American businesses. On the other hand, if Canada repeals its anti-circumvention law, we can make billions of dollars, destroy the profits of America&#39;s most important technological allies, liberate ourselves from America&#39;s defective technology, and forge a durable, powerful anti-Trump alliance with American firms who are preyed upon just as surely as Canadians are. Let&#39;s shoot the hostage. Let&#39;s change the rules of the game. Let&#39;s break the deadlock. It&#39;s what Keanu would tell us to do.

      <source:markdown>I wanted to have the most accurate timepiece possible mounted in my mini rack. Therefore I built this:

![Raspberry Pi Pico GPS Clock for Mini Rack](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/pico-gps-clock-mini-rack/pico-gps-clock-mini-rack.jpg)

This is a GPS-based clock running on a Raspberry Pi Pico in a custom 1U 10&#34; rack faceplate. The clock displays time based on a GPS input, and will not display time until a GPS timing lock has been acquired.

- When you turn on the Pico, the display reads `----`
- Upon 3D fix, you get a time on the clock, and the colon starts blinking
- If the 3D fix is lost, the colon goes solid
- When the 3D fix is regained, the colon starts blinking again

        <![CDATA[<p>Toward the end of 2021, I wrote about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/18620">working a four-day week</a>. It really suited me. So much so that I’ve gone one further. For the past year or so I’ve been working a three-day week.</p>
        
        <p>I work on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. From Friday to Monday, my days are my own.</p>
        
        <p>This <em>really</em> changes the dynamic of the week. It no longer feels like an extended weekend. What I mean is that usually we think about the working week as the default and the weekend as the exception. That’s been flipped on its head for me. The three days I spend working feel like the exception.</p>
        
        <p>Once again, this decision meant earning less money. But I’ve decided that I value time more than money. I know that’s a privileged position to be in. Many people have to expend all their time in order to make just enough money.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve made some choices along the way that certainly help. I don’t have children. I don’t have a car. I live in a modest flat and I’ve paid off the mortgage. I live in a country where healthcare is free.</p>
        
        <p>So I don’t have too many expenses. My biggest expenses are travel-related; getting to the States to see family, or travelling to Irish music festivals wherever they may be.</p>
        
        <p>But still, working a three-day week means I can make enough to cover my expenses and still put some money aside for the future.</p>
        
        <p>Now, this wouldn’t work for everyone. My work tends to be the kind that doesn’t require much direct collaboration (which is also why I mostly work from home). I imagine it could get frustrating being on a team of people working different numbers of days.</p>
        
        <p>I’m also really lucky to have the choice to do this. I know that many workplaces wouldn’t allow this kind of lifestyle. <a href="https://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> is different.</p>
        
        <p>In <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/21110">my last conference talk</a>, I touched on this:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>I think you could you could divide management into two categories like you can do with programming languages. There is a very imperative school of management where it’s all about measurements, it’s all about those performance reports, it’s all about metrics, time tracking. Maybe they install software on your machine to track how long you’ve been working. It’s all about measuring those outputs.</p>
        
          <p>That’s one approach to management. Then there’s a more declarative approach, where you just care about the work getting done and you don’t care how people do it. So if they want to work from home, let them work from home. If they want to work strange hours, let them work strange hours. What do you care as long as the work gets done? This is more about giving people autonomy and trust.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>I’m very happy that Clearleft takes the declarative approach.</p>
        
        <p>And I can reiterate <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/18620">what I said when I stopped working on Fridays</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>I haven’t experienced any reduction in productivity. Quite the opposite. There may be a corollary to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s Law</a>: work contracts to fill the time available.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Now that I don’t work on Mondays, bank holiday weekends don’t mean much to me anymore. Or to put it another way, every weekend is like a bank holiday weekend. If I want to travel somewhere on a Friday and come back on a Monday, I don’t need to book any time off. That’s really nice.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve got four days in a row to do with as I wish. I had to fight the urge to immediately launch into some new project or side-hustle to fill the time. I’m savouring it instead.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve got time to take care of <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. I’ve got time to read. I’ve got time to cook. I’ve got time to spend learning Irish. Mostly I’ve got time to just <em>be</em>.</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>Toward the end of 2021, I wrote about [working a four-day week](https://adactio.com/journal/18620). It really suited me. So much so that I’ve gone one further. For the past year or so I’ve been working a three-day week.

I work on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. From Friday to Monday, my days are my own.

This _really_ changes the dynamic of the week. It no longer feels like an extended weekend. What I mean is that usually we think about the working week as the default and the weekend as the exception. That’s been flipped on its head for me. The three days I spend working feel like the exception.

Once again, this decision meant earning less money. But I’ve decided that I value time more than money. I know that’s a privileged position to be in. Many people have to expend all their time in order to make just enough money.

I’ve made some choices along the way that certainly help. I don’t have children. I don’t have a car. I live in a modest flat and I’ve paid off the mortgage. I live in a country where healthcare is free.

So I don’t have too many expenses. My biggest expenses are travel-related; getting to the States to see family, or travelling to Irish music festivals wherever they may be.

But still, working a three-day week means I can make enough to cover my expenses and still put some money aside for the future.

Now, this wouldn’t work for everyone. My work tends to be the kind that doesn’t require much direct collaboration (which is also why I mostly work from home). I imagine it could get frustrating being on a team of people working different numbers of days.

I’m also really lucky to have the choice to do this. I know that many workplaces wouldn’t allow this kind of lifestyle. [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com/) is different.

In [my last conference talk](https://adactio.com/articles/21110), I touched on this:

&#62; I think you could you could divide management into two categories like you can do with programming languages. There is a very imperative school of management where it’s all about measurements, it’s all about those performance reports, it’s all about metrics, time tracking. Maybe they install software on your machine to track how long you’ve been working. It’s all about measuring those outputs.
&#62;
&#62; That’s one approach to management. Then there’s a more declarative approach, where you just care about the work getting done and you don’t care how people do it. So if they want to work from home, let them work from home. If they want to work strange hours, let them work strange hours. What do you care as long as the work gets done? This is more about giving people autonomy and trust.

I’m very happy that Clearleft takes the declarative approach.

And I can reiterate [what I said when I stopped working on Fridays](https://adactio.com/journal/18620):

&#62; I haven’t experienced any reduction in productivity. Quite the opposite. There may be a corollary to [Parkinson’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law): work contracts to fill the time available.

Now that I don’t work on Mondays, bank holiday weekends don’t mean much to me anymore. Or to put it another way, every weekend is like a bank holiday weekend. If I want to travel somewhere on a Friday and come back on a Monday, I don’t need to book any time off. That’s really nice.

I’ve got four days in a row to do with as I wish. I had to fight the urge to immediately launch into some new project or side-hustle to fill the time. I’m savouring it instead.

I’ve got time to take care of [The Session](https://thesession.org/). I’ve got time to read. I’ve got time to cook. I’ve got time to spend learning Irish. Mostly I’ve got time to just _be_.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Hey you,

Yes, you, who are thinking about not hiring a technical writer this year or, worse, erased one or more technical writing positions last year _because of AI_. You, who are buying into the promise of docs entirely authored by LLMs without expert oversight or guidance. You, who unloaded the weight of docs on your devs’ shoulders, as if it was a trivial chore.

You are making a big mistake. But you can still undo the damage.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>**[Don&#39;t fall into the anti-AI hype](https://antirez.com/news/158)**

I&#39;m glad someone was brave enough to say this. There is a _lot_ of anti-AI sentiment in the software development community these days. Much of it is justified, but if you let people convince you that AI isn&#39;t genuinely useful for software developers or that this whole thing will blow over soon it&#39;s becoming clear that you&#39;re taking on a very real risk to your future career.

As Salvatore Sanfilippo puts it:

&#62; It does not matter if AI companies will not be able to get their money back and the stock market will crash. All that is irrelevant, in the long run. It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway.

I do like this hopeful positive outlook on what this could all mean, emphasis mine:

&#62; How do I feel, about all the code I wrote that was ingested by LLMs? I feel great to be part of that, because I see this as a continuation of what I tried to do all my life: democratizing code, systems, knowledge. **LLMs are going to help us to write better software, faster, and will allow small teams to have a chance to compete with bigger companies**. The same thing open source software did in the 90s.

        <![CDATA[<p>Last month I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">wrote about porting JustHTML from Python to JavaScript</a> using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2 in a few hours while also buying a Christmas tree and watching Knives Out 3. I ended that post with a series of open questions about the ethics and legality of this style of work. Alexander Petros on <a href="https://lobste.rs/">lobste.rs</a> just <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/cmsfbu/don_t_fall_into_anti_ai_hype#c_cqkdve">challenged me to answer them</a>, which is fair enough! Here's my attempt at that.</p>
        <p>You can read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">the original post</a> for background, but the short version is that it's now possible to point a coding agent at some other open source project and effectively tell it "port this to language X and make sure the tests still pass" and have it do exactly that.</p>
        <p>Here are the questions I posed along with my answers based on my current thinking. Extra context is that I've since tried variations on a similar theme a few more times using Claude Code and Opus 4.5 and found it to be <em>astonishingly</em> effective.</p>
        <h4 id="does-this-library-represent-a-legal-violation-of-copyright-of-either-the-rust-library-or-the-python-one">Does this library represent a legal violation of copyright of either the Rust library or the Python one?</h4>

        <p>After sitting on this for a while I've come down on yes, provided full credit is given and the license is carefully considered. Open source allows and encourages further derivative works! I never got upset at some university student forking one of my projects on GitHub and hacking in a new feature that they used. I don't think this is materially different, although a port to another language entirely does feel like a slightly different shape.</p>
        <h4 id="does-this-format-of-development-hurt-the-open-source-ecosystem">Does this format of development hurt the open source ecosystem?</h4>
        <p>Now this one is complicated!</p>
        <p>It definitely hurts some projects because there are open source maintainers out there who say things like "I'm not going to release any open source code any more because I don't want it used for training" - I expect some of those would be equally angered by LLM-driven derived works as well.</p>
        <p>I don't know how serious this problem is - I've seen angry comments from anonymous usernames, but do they represent genuine open source contributions or are they just angry anonymous usernames?</p>
        <p>If we assume this is real, does the loss of those individuals get balanced out by the increase in individuals who CAN contribute to open source because they can now get work done in a few hours that might previously have taken them a few days that they didn't have to spare?</p>
        <p>I'll be brutally honest about that question: I think that if "they might train on my code / build a derived version with an LLM" is enough to drive you away from open source, your open source values are distinct enough from mine that I'm not ready to invest significantly in keeping you. I'll put that effort into welcoming the newcomers instead.</p>
        <p>The much bigger concern for me is the impact of generative AI on <em>demand</em> for open source. The recent <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/7/adam-wathan/">Tailwind story</a> is a visible example of this - while Tailwind blamed LLMs for reduced traffic to their documentation resulting in fewer conversions to their paid component library, I'm suspicious that the reduced demand there is because LLMs make building good-enough versions of those components for free easy enough that people do that instead.</p>
        <p>I've found myself affected by this for open source dependencies too. The other day I wanted to parse a cron expression in some Go code.

        <p>I expect that this is going to quite radically impact the shape of the open source library world over the next few years. Is that "harmful to open source"? It may well be. I'm hoping that whatever new shape comes out of this has its own merits, but I don't know what those would be.</p>

        <p>I'm not a lawyer so I don't feel credible to comment on this one. My loose hunch is that I'm still putting enough creative control in through the way I direct the models for that to count as enough human intervention, at least under US law, but I have no idea.</p>

        <p>What's important here is making it very clear to potential users what they should expect from that software.

      <source:markdown>Last month I [wrote about porting JustHTML from Python to JavaScript](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/) using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2 in a few hours while also buying a Christmas tree and watching Knives Out 3. I ended that post with a series of open questions about the ethics and legality of this style of work. Alexander Petros on [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) just [challenged me to answer them](https://lobste.rs/s/cmsfbu/don_t_fall_into_anti_ai_hype#c_cqkdve), which is fair enough! Here&#39;s my attempt at that.

You can read [the original post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/) for background, but the short version is that it&#39;s now possible to point a coding agent at some other open source project and effectively tell it &#34;port this to language X and make sure the tests still pass&#34; and have it do exactly that.

Here are the questions I posed along with my answers based on my current thinking. Extra context is that I&#39;ve since tried variations on a similar theme a few more times using Claude Code and Opus 4.5 and found it to be _astonishingly_ effective.

#### Does this library represent a legal violation of copyright of either the Rust library or the Python one?

I decided that the right thing to do here was to [keep the open source license and copyright statement](https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commit/a415d0af40c34bf9a856e956d841513f482867e3) from the Python library author and treat what I had built as a derivative work, which is the entire _point_ of open source.

#### Even if this is legal, is it ethical to build a library in this way?

After sitting on this for a while I&#39;ve come down on yes, provided full credit is given and the license is carefully considered. Open source allows and encourages further derivative works! I never got upset at some university student forking one of my projects on GitHub and hacking in a new feature that they used. I don&#39;t think this is materially different, although a port to another language entirely does feel like a slightly different shape.

#### Does this format of development hurt the open source ecosystem?

Now this one is complicated!

It definitely hurts some projects because there are open source maintainers out there who say things like &#34;I&#39;m not going to release any open source code any more because I don&#39;t want it used for training&#34; - I expect some of those would be equally angered by LLM-driven derived works as well.

I don&#39;t know how serious this problem is - I&#39;ve seen angry comments from anonymous usernames, but do they represent genuine open source contributions or are they just angry anonymous usernames?

If we assume this is real, does the loss of those individuals get balanced out by the increase in individuals who CAN contribute to open source because they can now get work done in a few hours that might previously have taken them a few days that they didn&#39;t have to spare?

I&#39;ll be brutally honest about that question: I think that if &#34;they might train on my code / build a derived version with an LLM&#34; is enough to drive you away from open source, your open source values are distinct enough from mine that I&#39;m not ready to invest significantly in keeping you. I&#39;ll put that effort into welcoming the newcomers instead.

      <source:markdown># 2025-12-30 Xobaque doesn’t know how to deal with missing pages

I run a small number of search engine instances using [Xobaque](Xobaque). I haven’t thought about what to do when sites move or disappear. Xobaque doesn’t crawl the web so it doesn’t know what’s out there. All it knows is what the feeds bring in.

When people move from one blog to another, they are unlikely to put their entire blog into their new feed on the new domain. Their feed might contain just the ten newest blog post. Eventually, those old posts are eventually orphaned in the Xobaque database. The articles can still be found but if the redirect chain stops working, the original articles can no longer be reached.

And if people did provide an archive feed (see RFC 5005) that still wouldn’t invalidate the old entries already in the database. The search engine would now show every result twice with one linking to the old blog post that’s gone and with one linking to the new blog post.

The search engine would need a “tombstone” feed full of links to posts to be deleted.

Or, and to me that sounds like the worst solution, I start doing updates to the database by hand, writing SQL statements. That wouldn’t work for long. So right now I’m a bit at a loss. Any good ideas? I’m sadly unaware of any sort of protocol that would allow this.

[#Xobaque](/search/?q=%23Xobaque) [#Feeds](/search/?q=%23Feeds)

**2026-01-03**. [@jamey](https://toot.cat/@jamey &#34;@jamey@toot.cat&#34;) pointed me at [RFC 6721](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6721.html) which offers an Atom `deleted-entry` element. Probably nobody implements it, but at least it’d be doable to script something: take an existing feed, translate all the links to deleted entries, feed that to Xobaque?

**2026-01-11**. I think the problem is that redirects and the like should result in changes at the source. But for Xobaque, the source is not its own database: it’s an OPML file or the like. It’s external and _somebody_ should update them because otherwise the old data will get reintroduced.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>I’ve been slowly reading [my copy of “The Internet Phone Book”](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/internet-phone-book/) and I recently read an essay in it by Elan Ullendorff called [“The New Turing Test”](https://escapethealgorithm.substack.com/p/the-new-turing-test).

Elan argues that what matters in a work isn’t the tools used to make it, but the “expressiveness” of the work itself (was it made “from someone, for someone, in a particular context”):

&#62; If something feels robotic or generic, it is those very qualities that make the work problematic, not the tools used.

This point reminded me that there was slop before AI came on the scene.

A lot of blogging was considered a primal form of slop when the internet first appeared: content of inferior substance, generated in quantities much vaster than heretofore considered possible.

And the truth is, perhaps a lot of the content in blogosphere was “slop”.

But it wasn’t slop because of the tools that made it — like Movable Type or Wordpress or Blogger.

It was slop because it lacked thought, care, and intention — the “expressiveness” Elan argues for.

You don’t need AI to produce slop because slop isn’t made by AI. It’s made by humans — AI is just the popular tool of choice for making it right now.

Slop existed long before LLMs came onto the scene.

It will doubtless exist long after too.

      <title>Focus rings with nested contrast-color()?</title>
      <link>https://daverupert.com/2026/01/nested-contrast-color-focus-rings/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>As I was playing around with <code>contrast-color()</code>, I got a wild idea that you could use <code>contrast-color()</code> to invert its return value by nesting it: <code>contrast-color(contrast-color(var(--some-color))</code>. When would this be useful? Uh… Good question. I couldn’t come up with an example right away but after a bit I found one sitting right under my nose….</p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2026/focus-rings.jpg" alt="four buttons in one line. a secondary button, an accented primary button with a focus state, a subtle button and a transparent button" /></p>
        <p>Our focus-rings in <a href="https://storybooks.fluentui.dev/web-components/">Fluent</a> use a 1px inset white highlight and a 2px offset black focus-ring. It’s a smidge chonkier than the Chromium default. The reason we do this is to guarantee contrast against the focused-element, in the above example, a blue button. Without the addition of the white stroke, the black outline wouldn’t “pop” with enough contrast to the blue background.</p>
        <p>To make this work, we have a <code>--focus-inner-ring</code> token and a <code>--focus-outer-ring</code> token themed for both light and dark modes.</p>
        <div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="o">*</span><span class="nd">:focus-visible</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <p>Yeah… I’d probably do that. You dodge the spotty <code>contrast-color()</code> support and have a singular function instead of a nested situation. It keeps it simple and readable.</p>
        <p>If you converted this to tokens, you’d probably need four tokens to fill out the inner/outer and light/dark matrix. But I’d consider not using custom color tokens for focus-rings at all and embrace the higher contrast… or limit tokens to the outer-ring.</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>As I was playing around with `contrast-color()`, I got a wild idea that you could use `contrast-color()` to invert its return value by nesting it: `contrast-color(contrast-color(var(--some-color))`. When would this be useful? Uh… Good question. I couldn’t come up with an example right away but after a bit I found one sitting right under my nose….

![four buttons in one line. a secondary button, an accented primary button with a focus state, a subtle button and a transparent button](https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2026/focus-rings.jpg)

Our focus-rings in [Fluent](https://storybooks.fluentui.dev/web-components/) use a 1px inset white highlight and a 2px offset black focus-ring. It’s a smidge chonkier than the Chromium default. The reason we do this is to guarantee contrast against the focused-element, in the above example, a blue button. Without the addition of the white stroke, the black outline wouldn’t “pop” with enough contrast to the blue background.

To make this work, we have a `--focus-inner-ring` token and a `--focus-outer-ring` token themed for both light and dark modes.

```
*:focus-visible {
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 var(--focus-inner-ring);
  outline: 2px solid var(--focus-outer-ring);
  outline-offset: 1px;
}

```

How would this change with nested `contrast-color()`?

```
*:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid contrast-color(var(--page-bg));
  outline-offset: 1px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 contrast-color(contrast-color(var(--page-bg)));
}

```

All you would need is one token you probably already have ( `--page-bg`) vs two tokens. Neat.

One consideration… your focus-ring isn’t always on a `--page-bg`. Sometimes it shows up on a `--card-bg` and this little trick might fall apart. As always, your mileage may vary.

Aside: This got me thinking it’d be nice to have a `currentBackgroundColor` like we have `currentColor` in CSS today. I’m not sure how much career I’ve got left to wait for that, but who knows.

## On second thought…

Mulling this over a bit more… you might be better off using `color-scheme` and `light-dark()` for this instead.

```
 :root {
	 color-scheme: light dark;
 }

 *:focus-visible {
   box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 light-dark(white, black);
   outline: 2px solid light-dark(black, white);
   outline-offset: 1px;
}

```

Yeah… I’d probably do that. You dodge the spotty `contrast-color()` support and have a singular function instead of a nested situation. It keeps it simple and readable.

If you converted this to tokens, you’d probably need four tokens to fill out the inner/outer and light/dark matrix. But I’d consider not using custom color tokens for focus-rings at all and embrace the higher contrast… or limit tokens to the outer-ring.</source:markdown>

      <link>https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2026-01-11-xobaque-sitemaps</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2026-01-11-xobaque-imports-sitemaps">2026-01-11 Xobaque imports Sitemaps</h1>
        
        <p>If you have a small number of sites you want to cover with your own search engine, I might have you covered. <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a> is a search engine based on Sqlite. The most useful part of it is that it doesn&rsquo;t crawl the web. So how does it index the pages? You feed it with a list of feeds (RSS, Atom, JSON), or with a list of OPML files (containing feeds), or a list of Sitemaps (linking to every page directly).</p>
        
        <p>I have been running three instances for a while, now.
        The Emacs database is the smallest one with just 27 MB.
        The indieblog.page database is 709 MB.
        The largest one is the RPG database with 769 MB.</p>
        
        <p>So, how small is &lsquo;a small number of sites&rsquo;?
        The indieblog.page search index covers 6429 domains and 273,721 pages; the RPG search index covers 436 domains and 147&rsquo;981 pages. 😬</p>
        
        <p>Xobaque knows how to handle paginated feeds as specified in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5005.html">RFC 5005</a>.
        All the blogs hosted by Google via Blogspot and Blogger support this.
        That means the search engine can go through the feed following the links to the next feed page until it has ingested the whole site &ndash; as long as the whole site shows up in the paginated feed at some point.</p>
        
        <p>Xobaque knows how to handle sitemaps as specified on the <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/">Sitemaps site</a>.
        This is document that links to all the pages on a site.
        All the blogs hosted by Google via Blogspot and Blogger support these Sitemaps.
        The drawback from my point of view is that the search engine then has to request every single one of these pages individually.

      <source:markdown># 2026-01-11 Xobaque imports Sitemaps

If you have a small number of sites you want to cover with your own search engine, I might have you covered. [Xobaque](Xobaque) is a search engine based on Sqlite. The most useful part of it is that it doesn’t crawl the web. So how does it index the pages? You feed it with a list of feeds (RSS, Atom, JSON), or with a list of OPML files (containing feeds), or a list of Sitemaps (linking to every page directly).

I have been running three instances for a while, now.
The Emacs database is the smallest one with just 27 MB.
The indieblog.page database is 709 MB.
The largest one is the RPG database with 769 MB.

So, how small is ‘a small number of sites’?
The indieblog.page search index covers 6429 domains and 273,721 pages; the RPG search index covers 436 domains and 147’981 pages. 😬

Xobaque knows how to handle paginated feeds as specified in [RFC 5005](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5005.html).
All the blogs hosted by Google via Blogspot and Blogger support this.
That means the search engine can go through the feed following the links to the next feed page until it has ingested the whole site – as long as the whole site shows up in the paginated feed at some point.

Xobaque knows how to handle sitemaps as specified on the [Sitemaps site](https://www.sitemaps.org/).
This is document that links to all the pages on a site.
All the blogs hosted by Google via Blogspot and Blogger support these Sitemaps.
The drawback from my point of view is that the search engine then has to request every single one of these pages individually.
A feed or a paginated feed is better since you’re getting ten pages or more per request.

Xobaque follows the directives in a `/robots.txt` page as specified in [RFC 9309](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html) follows the non-standard `Crawl-Delay` directive. Yay!

        <section class="p-summary">
        Earlier this year, we warned you to turn off Gemini on Android because
        Google decided that its AI would have access to its users’ apps - even
        if they had previously turned tracking for Gemini Apps Activity off. So
        regardless of whether you told Google’s Gemini not to track you in the
        past, its AI tool might be able to run tasks like send WhatsApp
        messages, set timers, and even make calls on your Android device.
        Worryingly, Google’s AI invasion does not stop there. Now, Google has
        turned on settings like smart features, without your consent, and Gemini
        can scan your Gmail emails, Photos, Drive, and other apps. In this
        guide, we show you how to turn off Gemini on Android and all your Google

        Digital Sufficiency in Data Centers : Studying the Impact of User

        </h2>
        <section class="p-summary">
        The Information Technologies (IT) industry has an increasing carbon
        footprint (2.1-3.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020),
        incompatible with the rapid decarbonization needed to mitigate climate
        change. Data centers hold a significant share due to their electricity
        consumption amounting to 1% of the global electricity consumption in
        2018. To reduce this footprint, research has mainly focused on energy
        efficiency measures and use of renewable energy. While these works are
        needed, they also convey the risk of rebound effects, i.e., a growth in
        demand as a result of the efficiency gains. For this reason, it appears
        essential to accompany them with sufficiency measures, i.e., a conscious
        use of these technologies with the aim to decrease the total energy and
        resource consumption. In this thesis, we introduce a model for data
        centers and their users. In the first part, we focus on direct users,
        interacting with the infrastructure by submitting jobs. We define five
        sufficiency behaviors they can adopt to reduce their stress on the
        infrastructure, namely Delay, Reconfig, Space Degrad, Time Degrad and
        Renounce. We characterize these behaviors through simulation on
        real-world inputs. The results allow us to classify them according to
        their energy saving potential, impact on scheduling metrics and effort
        required from users.

        This specification defines a Zstandard-based format for compressed WARC

        Annex D.
        </p>
        In general, Zstandard can produce significantly smaller files than GZIP
        while also achieving faster compression and decompression. Zstandard
        also offers a much wider range of compression levels, ranging from
        extremely fast compression with a modest size reduction to extremely
        slow compression with a much better reduction. For files containing many
        small records, Zstandard dictionaries can be used to reduce file size
        even further, while still permitting random access to individual
        records.

        <p>
        The world is crossing the 1.5°C global warming limit, perhaps exceeding
        2°C soon after. What is to be done when these boundaries, set by the
        Paris Agreement, have been passed? In the overshoot era, schemes
        proliferate for muscular adaptation or for new technologies to turn the
        heat down at a later date by re­moving CO2 from the air or blocking
        sunlight. Such technologies are by no means safe; they come with immense
        risks and provide an excuse for those who would prefer to avoid limiting
        emissions in the present. But do they also hold out some potential? Can
        the catastrophe be reversed, masked or simply adapted to once it is a
        fact? Or will any such round­about measures simply make things worse?

        The Long Heat maps the new front lines in the struggle for a liveable
        planet and insists on the climate revolution long overdue. In the end,

        Perennials are plants that have a life cycle of at least three years—as
        opposed to annuals (plants that have to be grown from seed anew each
        year because they have a single-year lifecycle) and biennials (plants
        that spend a year growing and then another year producing seed and
        dying—so they have a two-year life cycle). Some perennial plants are
        herbaceous (meaning they have tender stalks that may die back in the
        cold season, then grow again from the root) and others are woody
        (meaning they have woody stalks that tend to continue growing above soil
        year after year), In this zine we are mainly discussing edible
        herbaceous perennials, but we will mention a few woody plants as well.

Your Second Brain has little somatic metadata. It’s disembodied text
floating in a void, stripped of the rich contextual markers that would
actually help you remember and use it. When you try to retrieve
something from your Obsidian vault, you’re searching keywords. When you
try to retrieve something from your actual brain, you might think “that
thing I was reading when I was annoyed at that airport” and the whole
cluster of associated memories lights up.

We’ve been treating digital notes like they’re interchangeable with
mental notes, when they’re actually a much degraded format.

## 🔖 [Digital Sufficiency in Data Centers : Studying the Impact of User\ Behaviors](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04675558)

The Information Technologies (IT) industry has an increasing carbon
footprint (2.1-3.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020),
incompatible with the rapid decarbonization needed to mitigate climate
change. Data centers hold a significant share due to their electricity
consumption amounting to 1% of the global electricity consumption in
2018\. To reduce this footprint, research has mainly focused on energy
efficiency measures and use of renewable energy. While these works are
needed, they also convey the risk of rebound effects, i.e., a growth in
demand as a result of the efficiency gains. For this reason, it appears
essential to accompany them with sufficiency measures, i.e., a conscious
use of these technologies with the aim to decrease the total energy and
resource consumption. In this thesis, we introduce a model for data
centers and their users. In the first part, we focus on direct users,
interacting with the infrastructure by submitting jobs. We define five
sufficiency behaviors they can adopt to reduce their stress on the
infrastructure, namely Delay, Reconfig, Space Degrad, Time Degrad and
Renounce. We characterize these behaviors through simulation on
real-world inputs. The results allow us to classify them according to
their energy saving potential, impact on scheduling metrics and effort
required from users.

This specification defines a Zstandard-based format for compressed WARC
files, as an alternative to the GZIP-based format defined in WARC/1.1
Annex D.

In general, Zstandard can produce significantly smaller files than GZIP
while also achieving faster compression and decompression. Zstandard
also offers a much wider range of compression levels, ranging from
extremely fast compression with a modest size reduction to extremely
slow compression with a much better reduction. For files containing many
small records, Zstandard dictionaries can be used to reduce file size
even further, while still permitting random access to individual
records.

A scathing critique of proposals to geoengineer our way out of climate
disaster, by the bestselling authors of Overshoot

The world is crossing the 1.5°C global warming limit, perhaps exceeding
2°C soon after. What is to be done when these boundaries, set by the
Paris Agreement, have been passed? In the overshoot era, schemes
proliferate for muscular adaptation or for new technologies to turn the
heat down at a later date by re­moving CO2 from the air or blocking
sunlight. Such technologies are by no means safe; they come with immense
risks and provide an excuse for those who would prefer to avoid limiting
emissions in the present. But do they also hold out some potential? Can
the catastrophe be reversed, masked or simply adapted to once it is a
fact? Or will any such round­about measures simply make things worse?

The Long Heat maps the new front lines in the struggle for a liveable
planet and insists on the climate revolution long overdue. In the end,
no technology can absolve us of respon

## 🔖 [Edible Perennials for Community Preparedness](https://www.tangledwilderness.org/zines/edible-perennials-for-community-preparedness)

Perennials are plants that have a life cycle of at least three years—as
opposed to annuals (plants that have to be grown from seed anew each
year because they have a single-year lifecycle) and biennials (plants
that spend a year growing and then another year producing seed and
dying—so they have a two-year life cycle). Some perennial plants are
herbaceous (meaning they have tender stalks that may die back in the
cold season, then grow again from the root) and others are woody
(meaning they have woody stalks that tend to continue growing above soil
year after year), In this zine we are mainly discussing edible
herbaceous perennials, but we will mention a few woody plants as well.

## 🔖 [Neur\ is a programming language based on McCulloch-Pitts neurons.](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/neur.html)

Neural nets have an inclination for recipe crafting that resembles
rewriting languages, but do not incur the cost of searching and matching
facts against a database, reagents in rules are wired directly between
each other like state-machines.

## 🔖 [The future\ of htmx](https://htmx.org/essays/future/)

htmx is the New jQuery

Now, that’s a ridiculous (and arrogant) statement to make, of course,
but it is an ideal that we on the htmx team are striving for.

In particular, we want to emulate these technical characteristics of
jQuery that make it such a low-cost, high-value addition to the toolkits
of web developers. Alex has discussed “Building The 100 Year Web
Service” and we want htmx to be a useful tool for exactly that use case.

Websites that are built with jQuery stay online for a very long time,
and websites built with htmx should be capable of the same (or better).

Going forward, htmx will be developed with its existing users in mind.

If you are an existing user of htmx—or are thinking about becoming
one—here’s what that means

## 🔖 [The Case for Blogging in the Ruins](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-case-for-blogging-in-the-ruins/)

Diderot built the Encyclopédie because he believed that organizing
knowledge properly could change how people thought. He spent two decades
on it. He went broke. He watched collaborators quit and authorities try
to destroy his work. He kept going because the infrastructure mattered,
because how we structure the presentation of ideas affects the ideas
themselves.

We’re not going to get a better internet by waiting for platforms to
become less extractive. We build it by building it. By maintaining our
own spaces, linking to each other, creating the interconnected web of
independent sites that the blogosphere once was and could be again.

## 🔖 [Building software to last forever](https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/)

This is a great question, and one I have put a lot of thought into, even
going so far as to put “Built to last forever” on the landing page.
While drafting a lengthly reply I realised that I’d never articulated
the design philosophy of Bear to anyone bar friends.

So, without further ado, here are the choices I made in designing and
building Bear with regards to longevity…

## 🔖 [Triptych Proposals](https://alexanderpetros.com/triptych/)

Triptych is three simple proposals that make HTML much more expressive
in how it can make and handle network requests.

If you are a practical person, you could say it brings the best of htmx
(and other attributed-based page replacement libraries, like turbo and
unpoly) to HTML. For the more theoretically-inclined, it completes
HTML’s ability to do Representational State Transfer (REST) by making it
a sufficient self-describing representation for a much wider variety of
problem spaces.

## 🔖 [Building a fast website with the MASH stack in Rust](https://emschwartz.me/building-a-fast-website-with-the-mash-stack-in-rust/)

I’m building Scour, a personalized content feed that sifts through noisy
feeds like Hacker News Newest, subreddits, and blogs to find great
content for you. It works pretty well – and it’s fast. Scour is written
in Rust and if you’re building a website or service in Rust, you should
consider using this “stack”.

After evaluating various frameworks and libraries, I settled on a couple
of key ones and then discovered that someone had written it up as a
stack. Shantanu Mishra described the same set of libraries I landed on
as the “mash 🥔 stack” and gave it the tagline “as simple as potatoes”.
This stack is fast and nice to work with, so I wanted to write up my
experience building with it to help spread the word.

TL;DR: The stack is made up of Maud, Axum, SQLx, and HTMX and, if you
want, you can skip down to where I talk about synergies between these
libraries. (Also, Scour is free to use and I’d love it if you tried it
out and posted feedback on the suggestions board!)

## 🔖 [Paper AI\ Tigers](https://www.gleech.org/paper)

Making sense of current Chinese AI.

## 🔖 [Disrupting the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf)

We have developed sophisticated safety and security measures to prevent
the misuse of our AI models. While these measures are generally
effective, cybercriminals and other malicious actors continually attempt
to find ways around them. This report details a recent threat campaign
we identified and disrupted, along with the steps we’ve taken to detect
and counter this type of abuse. This represents the work of Threat
Intelligence: a dedicated team at Anthropic that investigates real world
cases of misuse and works within our Safeguards organization to improve
our defenses against such cases.

## 🔖 [The XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/)

The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your
actual problem. This leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and
energy, both on the part of people asking for help, and on the part of
those providing help.

## 🔖 [feedtoot](https://gitlab.com/jeancf/feedtoot)

feedtoot is a python script that downloads an RSS or Atom feed,
processes the new entries and posts a summary of each as a toot on a
Mastodon.

## 🔖 [Getting off US tech: a guide](https://disconnect.blog/getting-off-us-tech-a-guide/)

The United States has become the world’s biggest bully, threatening any
country that doesn’t do as it demands with tariffs, and its tech
companies are taking full advantage by flexing their muscle and trying
to avoid effective regulation around the world. The drawbacks of our
dependence on US tech companies have become more obvious with every
passing year, but now there can hardly be any denying that where we can
pry ourselves away from them, we should make the effort to do so.

Break up with the Big Tech cloud in this unique 1 x 6hr live training

Provocative experiment from Drew Breunig, who designed a new library for time formatting (&#34;3 hours ago&#34; kind of thing) called &#34;whenwords&#34; that has no code at all, just a carefully written specification, an AGENTS.md and a collection of conformance tests in a YAML file.

Pass that to your coding agent of choice, tell it what language you need and it will write it for you on demand!

        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2026-01-10-what-are-the-ai-bulls-saying">2026-01-10 What are the AI bulls saying?</h1>
        
        <p>If you follow my <a href="Artificial_Intelligence_Bookmarks">Artificial Intelligence Bookmarks</a>
        you know that I am very critical of AI. But not everybody is.</p>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand why the fund managers aren&rsquo;t selling off the Magnificent Seven. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms make up about 35% of S&amp;P 500. I guess the fund managers are reading the kind of stuff iShares by Blackrock puts out, like <a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/insights/ai-stocks-bubble-2025-valuation-outlook">Are AI stocks in a bubble? Why this isn’t a dot-com redux</a> from early November 2025, by Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy for the Americas. The key takeaways at the top of the article:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Tech stocks have surged amid growing excitement over artificial intelligence, but valuations have remained well below dot-com bubble era levels.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Not sure what to make of that. I guess they think if some investors feel the fear of a dot-com crash in their bones, then they&rsquo;re saying it won&rsquo;t be as bad as that. OK, fair enough.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Unlike the speculative excesses of the late 1990s, today’s AI spending has been largely funded by profits, grounded in real demand and supported by strong balance sheets from established tech leaders.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>That I can&rsquo;t understand. Ed Zitron seems to be saying that it&rsquo;s circular lending and this is the deadliest sin? They even mention circular lending further down:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Recent reports of deals where a supplier helps finance a customer who then spends money back with that supplier (either directly or via a partner) have raised concerns about the dot.com-era practice known as circular financing. Circular financing can be risky when it hides weak end‑demand. During the dot-com boom, equipment vendors boosted sales to mask a demand gap that later imploded. In our opinion, though, that’s not the case today. AI usage is already large and growing very quickly.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Uhm, well, I keep hearing about stupid uses of AI. Bosses who tell their employees they must use AI for everything or get fired. Mind blowing levels of misaligned incentives in middle management, I fear. They end the section with an example from a company that hasn&rsquo;t made a lot of positive news, at least as far as doors not falling off are concerned:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Notably, industries with big, long‑lived assets have tended to blend sales and financing. Boeing, for example, has long provided asset‑backed financing so airlines can take delivery of new planes.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Oh no. That is not a good argument to make.</p>
        
        <p>But I guess it still means that this sort of circular investment is common. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I must like it.</p>
        
        <p>Anyway, back to the key takeaways at the top:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>We believe investors should stay selective but engaged in the AI theme — focusing on companies with durable cash flow, pricing power, and real user demand.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>What does that even mean? Disregard all AI and just look at cash flow, pricing power and real user demand? Because those Ed Zitron articles I read seem to say that cash flow with regards to AI was bad, pricing power was bad, and organic user demand was low. Plus all the other problems. But I guess if the company is big like Microsoft, and AI is just a small part of it … uh oh, but that they&rsquo;re eating their own dog food so my trust is low.</p>
        
        <p>Then again, didn&rsquo;t like Microsoft ever since Windows 3.11 that didn&rsquo;t stop them from growing very, very big.</p>

&#62; Tech stocks have surged amid growing excitement over artificial intelligence, but valuations have remained well below dot-com bubble era levels.

Not sure what to make of that. I guess they think if some investors feel the fear of a dot-com crash in their bones, then they’re saying it won’t be as bad as that. OK, fair enough.

&#62; Unlike the speculative excesses of the late 1990s, today’s AI spending has been largely funded by profits, grounded in real demand and supported by strong balance sheets from established tech leaders.

That I can’t understand. Ed Zitron seems to be saying that it’s circular lending and this is the deadliest sin? They even mention circular lending further down:

&#62; Recent reports of deals where a supplier helps finance a customer who then spends money back with that supplier (either directly or via a partner) have raised concerns about the dot.com-era practice known as circular financing. Circular financing can be risky when it hides weak end‑demand. During the dot-com boom, equipment vendors boosted sales to mask a demand gap that later imploded. In our opinion, though, that’s not the case today. AI usage is already large and growing very quickly.

Uhm, well, I keep hearing about stupid uses of AI. Bosses who tell their employees they must use AI for everything or get fired. Mind blowing levels of misaligned incentives in middle management, I fear. They end the section with an example from a company that hasn’t made a lot of positive news, at least as far as doors not falling off are concerned:

&#62; Notably, industries with big, long‑lived assets have tended to blend sales and financing. Boeing, for example, has long provided asset‑backed financing so airlines can take delivery of new planes.

Oh no. That is not a good argument to make.

But I guess it still means that this sort of circular investment is common. That doesn’t mean I must like it.

Anyway, back to the key takeaways at the top:

&#62; We believe investors should stay selective but engaged in the AI theme — focusing on companies with durable cash flow, pricing power, and real user demand.

What does that even mean? Disregard all AI and just look at cash flow, pricing power and real user demand? Because those Ed Zitron articles I read seem to say that cash flow with regards to AI was bad, pricing power was bad, and organic user demand was low. Plus all the other problems. But I guess if the company is big like Microsoft, and AI is just a small part of it … uh oh, but that they’re eating their own dog food so my trust is low.

Then again, didn’t like Microsoft ever since Windows 3.11 that didn’t stop them from growing very, very big.

        <![CDATA[Today's links Predistribution vs redistribution (Big Tech edition): A thing that governments can do with 100% reliability. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Oral B lockpicks; Ipod Levi's; Sue Townsend on Adrian Mole; RIAA must pay $45m to Canadian musicians. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Predistribution vs redistribution (Big Tech edition) (permalink) All over the world, for all of this decade, governments have been trying to figure out how to rein in America's tech companies. During the Biden years, this seemed like a winner &#8211; after all, America was trying to tame its tech companies, too, with brave trustbusters like Lina Khan, Jonathan Kanter, Rohit Chopra and Tim Wu doing more work in four years than their predecessors had done in forty. But under Trump, the US government has thrown its full weight into defending its tech companies' right to spy on and rip off everyone in the world (including Americans, of course). It's not hard to understand how Big Tech earned Trump's loyalty: from the tech CEOs who personally paid a million dollars each to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais; to Apple CEO Tim Cook hand-assembling a gold participation trophy for Trump on camera; to Zuckerberg firing all his fact-checkers; to the seven-figure contributions that tech companies made to Trump's Epstein Memorial Ballroom at the White House. Trump is defending America's tech companies because they've bribed him, personally, to do so. Given that these companies are so much larger than most world governments, this poses a serious barrier to the kind of enforcement that world governments have tried. What's the point of fining Apple billions of Euros if they refuse to pay? What's the point of ordering Apple to open up its App Store if it just refuses? But here's the thing: most of these enforcement actions have been redistributive. In effect, lawmakers and regulators are saying to America's tech giants, We know you've stolen a bunch of money and data from our people, and now we want you to give some of it back. There's nothing inherently wrong with redistribution, but redistribution will never be as powerful or effective as predistribution &#8211; that is, preventing tech companies from stealing data and money in the first place. Take Big Tech's relationship to the world's news media. All over the world, media companies have been skeletonized by collapsing ad revenues and even where they can get paid subscribers, tech giants rake off huge junk fees from every subscriber payment. Reaching new or existing subscribers is also increasingly expensive, as tech platforms algorithmically suppress the reach of media companies' posts, even for subscribers who've asked to see their feeds, which lets the platforms charge more junk fees to "boost" content. Countries all over the world &#8211; Australia, Germany, Spain, France, Canada &#8211; have arrived at the same solution to this problem: imposing "link taxes" that require tech companies to pay for the privilege of linking to the news or allowing their users to discuss the news. This is pure redistribution: tech stole money from the media companies, so governments are making them give some of that money back. It hasn't worked. First of all, the thing tech steals from the news isn't the news, it's money. Helping people find and discuss the news isn't theft. News you're not allowed to find or discuss isn't news at all &#8211; that's a secret. Meanwhile, tech companies have an easy way to escape the link tax: they can just ban links to the news on their platform. That's what Meta did in Canada, which means that Canadians on Instagram and Facebook no longer see the actual news, just far-right "influencer" content. Even when tech companies do pay the link tax, the results are far from ideal: in Canada, Google has become a partner of news outlets, which compromises their ability to report on Google's activities. Shortly after Google promised millions to the Toronto Star, the paper dropped its award-winning, hard-hitting "Defanging Big Tech" investigative series. Given that Google came within centimeters of stealing most of downtown Toronto just a few years ago, we can hardly afford to have the city's largest newspaper climb into bed with the company: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/10/31/leaked-document-reveals-that-sidewalk-labs-toronto-plans-for-private-taxation-private-roads-charter-schools-corporate-cops-and-judges-and-punishment-for-people-who-choose-privacy/ Worse still: any effort to make Big Tech poorer &#8211; by curbing its predatory acquisition of our data and money &#8211; reduces its ability to pay the link tax, which means that, under a link tax, the media's future depends on Big Tech being able to go on ripping us off. All of which is not to say that Big Tech should be allowed to go on ripping off the media. Rather, it's to argue that we should stop tech from ripping off Canadians in the first place, as a superior alternative to asking Big Tech to remit a small share of the booty to a few lucky victims. Together, Meta and Google take 51 cents out of every advertising dollar. This is a huge share. Before the rise of surveillance advertising, the ad industry's share of advertising dollars amounted to about 15%. The Meta/Google ad-tech duopoly has cornered the ad market, and they illegally colluded to rig it, which allows them to steal billions from media outlets, all around the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Blue What would a predistribution approach to ad-tech look like? Canada could ban the collection and sale of consumer data outright, and punish any domestic firm that collects consumer data, which would choke off much of the supply of data that feeds the ad-tech market. Canada could also repeal its wildly unpopular "anticircumvention" law, The Copyright Modernisation Act of 2012 (Bill C-11), which was passed despite the public's overwhelming negative response to a consultation on the bill: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/15/radical-extremists/#sex-pest Under this law, it's illegal for Canadian companies to reverse engineer and modify America's tech exports. This means that Canadian companies can't go into business selling an alternative Facebook client that blocks all the surveillance advertising and restores access to the news, and offers non-surveillant, content-based ways for other Canadian businesses to advertise: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/save-news-we-must-ban-surveillance-advertising Repealing Bill C-11 would also allow Canadian companies to offer alternative app stores for phones and consoles. Google and Apple have a duopoly on mobile apps, and the two companies have rigged the market to take 30% of every in-app payment. The actual cost of processing a payment is less than 1%. This means that 30 cents out of every in-app subscriber dollar sent to a Canadian news outlet is shipped south to Cupertino or Mountain View. Legalizing made-in-Canada app stores, installed without permission from Apple or Google, would stop those dollars from being extracted in the first place. And not just media companies, of course &#8211; the app tax is paid by performers, software authors, and manufacturers. Extend the program to include games consoles and Canada's game companies would be rescued from Microsoft and Nintendo's own app tax, which also runs to 30%. But a C-11 repeal wouldn't merely safeguard Canadian dollars &#8211; it would also safeguard Canadian data. Our mobile phones collect and transmit mountains of data about us and our activities. Yes, even Apple's products &#8211; despite the company's high-flying rhetoric about its respect for your privacy, the company spies on everything you do with your phone and sells access to that data to advertisers. Apple doesn't offer any way to opt out of this, and lied about it when they were caught doing it: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar These companies will not voluntarily stop stealing our data. That's the lesson of nine years under the EU's GDPR, a landmark, strong privacy law that US tech companies simply refuse to obey. And because they claim to be headquartered in Ireland (because Ireland lets them cheat on their taxes) and because they have captured the Irish state, they are able to simply flout the law: https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta Telling Big Tech not to gather our data is redistribution. So is dictating how they can use it after they collect it. The predistribution version of this is modifying our devices so that they don't gather or leak our data in the first place. Big Tech is able to suck up so much of our data because anticircumvention law &#8211; like Canada's Bill C-11, or Article 6 of the EU Copyright Directive &#8211; makes it illegal to modify your phone so that it blocks digital spying, preventing the collection and transmission of your data. Repeal anticircumvention law and businesses could offer Canadians (or Europeans) (or anyone in the world with a credit card and an internet connection) a product that blocks surveillance on their devices. More than half of all web users have installed an ad-blocker for their browser (which offers significant surveillance protection), but no one can install anything like this on their phones (or smart TVs, or smart doorbells, or other gadgets) because anticircumvention law criminalizes this act. Big Tech are notorious tax cheats, colluding with captured governments like the Irish state to avoid taxes worldwide. Canada tried to pass a "digital service tax" that would make the US pay a small share of the tax it evades in Canada. Trump went bananas and threatened to hit the country with (more) tariffs, and Canada folded. Tax is redistributive, and getting money back from American companies after they steal it from Canadians is much harder than simply arranging the system so it's much harder for American companies to steal from Canadians in the first place. Blocking spying, clawing back the app tax, unrigging the ad market &#8211; these are all predistributive rather than redistributive. So is selling alternative clients for legacy social media products like Facebook and Twitter &#8211; clients that unrig their algorithms and let Canadians see the news they've subscribed to, so they can't be used as hostages to extract "boosting" fees from media outlets who want to reach their own subscribers. Canada's redistribution efforts have been a consistent failure. Canada keeps trying to get streaming companies like Netflix to include more Canadian content in their offerings and search results. Legalize jailbreaking and a Canadian company could start selling an alternative client that lets you search all your streaming services at once, mixing in results from Canadian media companies and archives like the National Film Board &#8211; all while blocking surveillance by the tech giants. This client could also incorporate a PVR, so you could record shows to watch later, without worrying about the tech giants making your favorite program vanish. Remember, if it's legal to record a show from broadcast or cable with a VCR or a Tivo, it's legal to record it from a streaming service with an app. These predistribution tactics don't rely on US tech companies obeying Canada's orders. Instead, they take away American companies' ability to use Canada's courts and law enforcement apparatus to shut down Canadian competitors who disenshittify America's spying, stealing tech exports. Canada may not be able to push Google or Apple or Facebook around, but Canada can always decide whether Google or Apple or Facebook can use its courts to push Canadian competitors around. Back in December, when Trump started threatening (again) to invade Canada and take over the country, Prime Minister Mark Carney broke off trade talks. Those talks are slated to begin again in a matter of days: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2025/12/19/canada-u-s-to-start-talks-to-review-free-trade-deal-in-mid-january/87843153007/ Getting Trump to deal fairly with Canada is just as unlikely as getting Trump's tech companies to give Canadians a fair shake. Canada isn't going to win the trade war with an agreement. Canada will win the trade war by winning: with Made-in-Canada tech products that turn America's stolen trillions into Canadian billions, to be divided up among Canadian tech businesses (who will reap profits) and the Canadian public (who will reap savings).

Colophon: All the rest. Predistribution vs redistribution (Big Tech edition) (permalink) All over the world, for all of this decade, governments have been trying to figure out how to rein in America&#39;s tech companies. During the Biden years, this seemed like a winner – after all, America was trying to tame its tech companies, too, with brave trustbusters like Lina Khan, Jonathan Kanter, Rohit Chopra and Tim Wu doing more work in four years than their predecessors had done in forty. But under Trump, the US government has thrown its full weight into defending its tech companies&#39; right to spy on and rip off everyone in the world (including Americans, of course). It&#39;s not hard to understand how Big Tech earned Trump&#39;s loyalty: from the tech CEOs who personally paid a million dollars each to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais; to Apple CEO Tim Cook hand-assembling a gold participation trophy for Trump on camera; to Zuckerberg firing all his fact-checkers; to the seven-figure contributions that tech companies made to Trump&#39;s Epstein Memorial Ballroom at the White House. Trump is defending America&#39;s tech companies because they&#39;ve bribed him, personally, to do so. Given that these companies are so much larger than most world governments, this poses a serious barrier to the kind of enforcement that world governments have tried. What&#39;s the point of fining Apple billions of Euros if they refuse to pay? What&#39;s the point of ordering Apple to open up its App Store if it just refuses? But here&#39;s the thing: most of these enforcement actions have been redistributive. In effect, lawmakers and regulators are saying to America&#39;s tech giants, We know you&#39;ve stolen a bunch of money and data from our people, and now we want you to give some of it back. There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with redistribution, but redistribution will never be as powerful or effective as predistribution – that is, preventing tech companies from stealing data and money in the first place. Take Big Tech&#39;s relationship to the world&#39;s news media. All over the world, media companies have been skeletonized by collapsing ad revenues and even where they can get paid subscribers, tech giants rake off huge junk fees from every subscriber payment. Reaching new or existing subscribers is also increasingly expensive, as tech platforms algorithmically suppress the reach of media companies&#39; posts, even for subscribers who&#39;ve asked to see their feeds, which lets the platforms charge more junk fees to &#34;boost&#34; content. Countries all over the world – Australia, Germany, Spain, France, Canada – have arrived at the same solution to this problem: imposing &#34;link taxes&#34; that require tech companies to pay for the privilege of linking to the news or allowing their users to discuss the news. This is pure redistribution: tech stole money from the media companies, so governments are making them give some of that money back. It hasn&#39;t worked. First of all, the thing tech steals from the news isn&#39;t the news, it&#39;s money. Helping people find and discuss the news isn&#39;t theft. News you&#39;re not allowed to find or discuss isn&#39;t news at all – that&#39;s a secret. Meanwhile, tech companies have an easy way to escape the link tax: they can just ban links to the news on their platform. That&#39;s what Meta did in Canada, which means that Canadians on Instagram and Facebook no longer see the actual news, just far-right &#34;influencer&#34; content. Even when tech companies do pay the link tax, the results are far from ideal: in Canada, Google has become a partner of news outlets, which compromises their ability to report on Google&#39;s activities. Shortly after Google promised millions to the Toronto Star, the paper dropped its award-winning, hard-hitting &#34;Defanging Big Tech&#34; investigative series. Given that Google came within centimeters of stealing most of downtown Toronto just a few years ago, we can hardly afford to have the city&#39;s largest newspaper climb into bed with the company: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/10/31/leaked-document-reveals-that-sidewalk-labs-toronto-plans-for-private-taxation-private-roads-charter-schools-corporate-cops-and-judges-and-punishment-for-people-who-choose-privacy/ Worse still: any effort to make Big Tech poorer – by curbing its predatory acquisition of our data and money – reduces its ability to pay the link tax, which means that, under a link tax, the media&#39;s future depends on Big Tech being able to go on ripping us off. All of which is not to say that Big Tech should be allowed to go on ripping off the media. Rather, it&#39;s to argue that we should stop tech from ripping off Canadians in the first place, as a superior alternative to asking Big Tech to remit a small share of the booty to a few lucky victims. Together, Meta and Google take 51 cents out of every advertising dollar. This is a huge share. Before the rise of surveillance advertising, the ad industry&#39;s share of advertising dollars amounted to about 15%. The Meta/Google ad-tech duopoly has cornered the ad market, and they illegally colluded to rig it, which allows them to steal billions from media outlets, all around the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi\_Blue What would a predistribution approach to ad-tech look like? Canada could ban the collection and sale of consumer data outright, and punish any domestic firm that collects consumer data, which would choke off much of the supply of data that feeds the ad-tech market. Canada could also repeal its wildly unpopular &#34;anticircumvention&#34; law, The Copyright Modernisation Act of 2012 (Bill C-11), which was passed despite the public&#39;s overwhelming negative response to a consultation on the bill: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/15/radical-extremists/#sex-pest Under this law, it&#39;s illegal for Canadian companies to reverse engineer and modify America&#39;s tech exports. This means that Canadian companies can&#39;t go into business selling an alternative Facebook client that blocks all the surveillance advertising and restores access to the news, and offers non-surveillant, content-based ways for other Canadian businesses to advertise: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/save-news-we-must-ban-surveillance-advertising Repealing Bill C-11 would also allow Canadian companies to offer alternative app stores for phones and consoles. Google and Apple have a duopoly on mobile apps, and the two companies have rigged the market to take 30% of every in-app payment. The actual cost of processing a payment is less than 1%. This means that 30 cents out of every in-app subscriber dollar sent to a Canadian news outlet is shipped south to Cupertino or Mountain View. Legalizing made-in-Canada app stores, installed without permission from Apple or Google, would stop those dollars from being extracted in the first place. And not just media companies, of course – the app tax is paid by performers, software authors, and manufacturers. Extend the program to include games consoles and Canada&#39;s game companies would be rescued from Microsoft and Nintendo&#39;s own app tax, which also runs to 30%. But a C-11 repeal wouldn&#39;t merely safeguard Canadian dollars – it would also safeguard Canadian data. Our mobile phones collect and transmit mountains of data about us and our activities. Yes, even Apple&#39;s products – despite the company&#39;s high-flying rhetoric about its respect for your privacy, the company spies on everything you do with your phone and sells access to that data to advertisers. Apple doesn&#39;t offer any way to opt out of this, and lied about it when they were caught doing it: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar These companies will not voluntarily stop stealing our data. That&#39;s the lesson of nine years under the EU&#39;s GDPR, a landmark, strong privacy law that US tech companies simply refuse to obey. And because they claim to be headquartered in Ireland (because Ireland lets them cheat on their taxes) and because they have captured the Irish state, they are able to simply flout the law: https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta Telling Big Tech not to gather our data is redistribution. So is dictating how they can use it after they collect it. The predistribution version of this is modifying our devices so that they don&#39;t gather or leak our data in the first place. Big Tech is able to suck up so much of our data because anticircumvention law – like Canada&#39;s Bill C-11, or Article 6 of the EU Copyright Directive – makes it illegal to modify your phone so that it blocks digital spying, preventing the collection and transmission of your data. Repeal anticircumvention law and businesses could offer Canadians (or Europeans) (or anyone in the world with a credit card and an internet connection) a product that blocks surveillance on their devices. More than half of all web users have installed an ad-blocker for their browser (which offers significant surveillance protection), but no one can install anything like this on their phones (or smart TVs, or smart doorbells, or other gadgets) because anticircumvention law criminalizes this act. Big Tech are notorious tax cheats, colluding with captured governments like the Irish state to avoid taxes worldwide. Canada tried to pass a &#34;digital service tax&#34; that would make the US pay a small share of the tax it evades in Canada. Trump went bananas and threatened to hit the country with (more) tariffs, and Canada folded. Tax is redistributive, and getting money back from American companies after they steal it from Canadians is much harder than simply arranging the system so it&#39;s much harder for American companies to steal from Canadians in the first place. Blocking spying, clawing back the app tax, unrigging the ad market – these are all predistributive rather than redistributive. So is selling alternative clients for legacy social media products like Facebook and Twitter – clients that unrig their algorithms and let Canadians see the news they&#39;ve subscribed to, so they can&#39;t be used as hostages to extract &#34;boosting&#34; fees from media outlets who want to reach their own subscribers. Canada&#39;s redistribution efforts have been a consistent failure. Canada keeps trying to get streaming companies like Netflix to include more Canadian content in their offerings and search results. Legalize jailbreaking and a Canadian company could start selling an alternative client that lets you search all your streaming services at once, mixing in results from Canadian media companies and archives like the National Film Board – all while blocking surveillance by the tech giants. This client could also incorporate a PVR, so you could record shows to watch later, without worrying about the tech giants making your favorite program vanish. Remember, if it&#39;s legal to record a show from broadcast or cable with a VCR or a Tivo, it&#39;s legal to record it from a streaming service with an app. These predistribution tactics don&#39;t rely on US tech companies obeying Canada&#39;s orders. Instead, they take away American companies&#39; ability to use Canada&#39;s courts and law enforcement apparatus to shut down Canadian competitors who disenshittify America&#39;s spying, stealing tech exports. Canada may not be able to push Google or Apple or Facebook around, but Canada can always decide whether Google or Apple or Facebook can use its courts to push Canadian competitors around. Back in December, when Trump started threatening (again) to invade Canada and take over the country, Prime Minister Mark Carney broke off trade talks. Those talks are slated to begin again in a matter of days: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2025/12/19/canada-u-s-to-start-talks-to-review-free-trade-deal-in-mid-january/87843153007/ Getting Trump to deal fairly with Canada is just as unlikely as getting Trump&#39;s tech companies to give Canadians a fair shake. Canada isn&#39;t going to win the trade war with an agreement. Canada will win the trade war by winning: with Made-in-Canada tech products that turn America&#39;s stolen trillions into Canadian billions, to be divided up among Canadian tech businesses (who will reap profits) and the Canadian public (who will reap savings).

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/9/sprites-dev/#atom-everything</link>

        <![CDATA[<p>New from Fly.io today: <a href="https://sprites.dev">Sprites.dev</a>. Here's their <a href="https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/">blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BfTLlwO4hw">YouTube demo</a>. It's an interesting new product that's quite difficult to explain - Fly call it "Stateful sandbox environments with checkpoint &amp; restore" but I see it as hitting two of my current favorite problems: a safe development environment for running coding agents <em>and</em> an API for running untrusted code in a secure sandbox.</p>
        <p><em>Disclosure: Fly sponsor some of my work. They did not ask me to write about Sprites and I didn't get preview access prior to the launch. My enthusiasm here is genuine.</em></p>

        </ul>
        
        <h4 id="developer-sandboxes">Developer sandboxes</h4>
        <p>I predicted earlier this week that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-a-challenger-disaster-for-coding-agent-security">"we’re due a Challenger disaster with respect to coding agent security"</a> due to the terrifying way most of us are using coding agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI. Running them in <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> mode (aka YOLO mode, where the agent acts without constantly seeking approval first) unlocks so much more power, but also means that a mistake or a malicious prompt injection can cause all sorts of damage to your system and data.</p>
        <p>The safe way to run YOLO mode is in a robust sandbox, where the worst thing that can happen is the sandbox gets messed up and you have to throw it away and get another one.</p>
        <p>That's the first problem Sprites solves:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>curl https://sprites.dev/install.sh <span class="pl-k">|</span> bash
        
        sprite login
        sprite create my-dev-environment
        sprite console -s my-dev-environment</pre></div>
        <p>That's all it takes to get SSH connected to a fresh environment, running in an ~8GB RAM, 8 CPU server. And... Claude Code and Codex and Gemini CLI and Python 3.13 and Node.js 22.20 and a bunch of other tools are already installed.</p>
        <p>The first time you run <code>claude</code> it neatly signs you in to your existing account with Anthropic. The Sprites VM is persistent so future runs of <code>sprite console -s</code> will get you back to where you were before.</p>
        <p>... and it automatically sets up port forwarding, so you can run a localhost server on your Sprite and access it from <code>localhost:8080</code> on your machine.</p>
        <p>There's also a command you can run to assign a public URL to your Sprite, so anyone else can access it if they know the secret URL.</p>
        <h4 id="storage-and-checkpoints">Storage and checkpoints</h4>
        <p>In <a href="https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/">the blog post</a> Kurt Mackey argues that ephemeral, disposable sandboxes are not the best fit for coding agents:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The state of the art in agent isolation is a read-only sandbox. At Fly.io, we’ve been selling that story for years, and we’re calling it: ephemeral sandboxes are obsolete. Stop killing your sandboxes every time you use them. [...]</p>
        <p>If you force an agent to, it’ll work around containerization and do work . But you’re not helping the agent in any way by doing that. They don’t want containers. They don’t want “sandboxes”. They want computers.</p>
        <p>[...] with an actual computer, Claude doesn’t have to rebuild my entire development environment every time I pick up a PR.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Each Sprite gets a proper filesystem which persists in between sessions, even while the Sprite itself shuts down after inactivity. It sounds like they're doing some clever filesystem tricks here, I'm looking forward to learning more about those in the future.</p>
        <p>There are some clues on <a href="https://sprites.dev/">the homepage</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>You read and write to fast, directly attached NVMe storage. Your data then gets written to durable, external object storage. [...]</p>
        <p>You don't pay for allocated filesystem space, just the blocks you write. And it's all TRIM friendly, so your bill goes down when you delete things.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The really clever feature is checkpoints. You (or your coding agent) can trigger a checkpoint which takes around 300ms. This captures the entire disk state and can then be rolled back to later.</p>
        <p>For more on how that works, run this in a Sprite:</p>
        <pre><code>cat /.sprite/docs/agent-context.md
        </code></pre>
        <p>Here's the relevant section:</p>
        <pre><code>## Checkpoints
        - Point-in-time checkpoints and restores available
        - Copy-on-write implementation for storage efficiency
        - Last 5 checkpoints mounted at `/.sprite/checkpoints`
        - Checkpoints capture only the writable overlay, not the base image
        </code></pre>
        <p>Or run this to see the <code>--help</code> for the command used to manage them:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>sprite-env checkpoints --help</pre></div>
        <p>Which looks like this:</p>
        <pre><code>sprite-env checkpoints - Manage environment checkpoints
        
        USAGE:
            sprite-env checkpoints &lt;subcommand&gt; [options]
        
        SUBCOMMANDS:
            list [--history &lt;ver&gt;]  List all checkpoints (optionally filter by history version)
            get &lt;id&gt;                Get checkpoint details (e.g., v0, v1, v2)
            create                  Create a new checkpoint (auto-versioned)
            restore &lt;id&gt;            Restore from a checkpoint (e.g., v1)
        
        NOTE:
            Checkpoints are versioned as v0, v1, v2, etc.
            Restore returns immediately and triggers an async restore that restarts the environment.
            The last 5 checkpoints are mounted at /.sprite/checkpoints for direct file access.
        
        EXAMPLES:
            sprite-env checkpoints list
            sprite-env checkpoints list --history v1.2.3
            sprite-env checkpoints get v2
            sprite-env checkpoints create
            sprite-env checkpoints restore v1
        </code></pre>
        <h4 id="really-clever-use-of-claude-skills">Really clever use of Claude Skills</h4>
        <p>I'm <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">a big fan of Skills</a>, the mechanism whereby Claude Code (and increasingly other agents too) can be given additional capabilities by describing them in Markdown files in a specific directory structure.</p>
        <p>In a smart piece of design, Sprites uses pre-installed skills to teach Claude how Sprites itself works. This means you can ask Claude on the machine how to do things like open up ports and it will talk you through the process.</p>
        <p>There's all sorts of interesting stuff in the <code>/.sprite</code> folder on that machine - digging in there is a great way to learn more about how Sprites works.</p>
        <h4 id="a-sandbox-api">A sandbox API</h4>
        <p>Also from my predictions post earlier this week: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-we-re-finally-going-to-solve-sandboxing">"We’re finally going to solve sandboxing"</a>. I am obsessed with this problem: I want to be able to run untrusted code safely, both on my personal devices and in the context of web services I'm building for other people to use.</p>
        <p>I have <em>so many things</em> I want to build that depend on being able to take untrusted code - from users or from LLMs or from LLMs-driven-by-users - and run that code in a sandbox where I can be confident that the blast radius if something goes wrong is tightly contained.</p>
        <p>Sprites offers a clean <a href="https://sprites.dev/api">JSON API</a> for doing exactly that, plus client libraries in <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-go">Go</a> and <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-js">TypeScript</a> and coming-soon <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py">Python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/superfly/sprites-ex">Elixir</a>.</p>
        <p>From their quick start:</p>
        <pre><code># Create a new sprite
        curl -X PUT https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/my-sprite \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN"
        
        # Execute a command
        curl -X POST https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/my-sprite/exec \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN" \
        -d '{"command": "echo hello"}'
        </code></pre>
        <p>You can also checkpoint and rollback via the API, so you can get your environment exactly how you like it, checkpoint it, run a bunch of untrusted code, then roll back to the clean checkpoint when you're done.</p>
        <p>Managing network access is an important part of maintaining a good sandbox. The Sprites API lets you <a href="https://sprites.dev/api/sprites/policies">configure network access policies</a> using a DNS-based allow/deny list like this:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>curl -X POST \
          <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/{name}/policy/network<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
          -H <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Authorization: Bearer <span class="pl-smi">$SPRITES_TOKEN</span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
          -H <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Content-Type: application/json<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
          -d <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>{</span>
        <span class="pl-s">    "rules": [</span>
        <span class="pl-s">      {</span>
        <span class="pl-s">        "action": "allow",</span>
        <span class="pl-s">        "domain": "github.com"</span>
        <span class="pl-s">      },</span>
        <span class="pl-s">      {</span>
        <span class="pl-s">        "action": "allow",</span>
        <span class="pl-s">        "domain": "*.npmjs.org"</span>
        <span class="pl-s">      }</span>
        <span class="pl-s">    ]</span>
        <span class="pl-s">  }<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
        
        <h4 id="scale-to-zero-billing">Scale-to-zero billing</h4>
        <p>Sprites have scale-to-zero baked into the architecture. They go to sleep after 30 seconds of inactivity, wake up quickly when needed and bill you for just the CPU hours, RAM hours and GB-hours of storage you use while the Sprite is awake.</p>
        <p>Fly <a href="https://sprites.dev/#billing">estimate</a> a 4 hour intensive coding session as costing around 46 cents, and a low traffic web app with 30 hours of wake time per month at ~$4.</p>
        <p>(I calculate that a web app that consumes all 8 CPUs and all 8GBs of RAM 24/7 for a month would cost ((7 cents * 8 * 24 * 30) + (4.375 cents * 8 * 24 * 30)) / 100  = $655.2 per month, so don't necessarily use these as your primary web hosting solution for an app that soaks up all available CPU and RAM!)</p>
        <h4 id="two-of-my-favorite-problems-at-once">Two of my favorite problems at once</h4>
        <p>I was hopeful that Fly would enter the developer-friendly sandbox API market, especially given other entrants from companies like <a href="https://sandbox.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> and <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandboxes">Modal</a> and <a href="https://e2b.dev/">E2B</a>.</p>
        <p>I did not expect that they'd tackle the developer sandbox problem at the same time, and with the same product!</p>
        <p>My one concern here is that it makes the product itself a little harder to explain.</p>
        <p>I'm already spinning up some prototypes of sandbox-adjacent things I've always wanted to build, and early signs are very promising. I'll write more about these as they turn into useful projects.</p>
        
        
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: Here's some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557825#46560748">additional colour</a> from Thomas Ptacek on Hacker News:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>This has been in the works for quite awhile here. We put a long bet on "slow create fast start/stop" --- which is a really interesting and useful shape for execution environments --- but it didn't make sense to sandboxers, so "fast create" has been the White Whale at Fly.io for over a year.</p>

It&#39;s an interesting new product that&#39;s quite difficult to explain - Fly call it &#34;Stateful sandbox environments with checkpoint &#38; restore&#34; but I see it as hitting two of my current favorite problems: a safe development environment for running coding agents _and_ an API for running untrusted code in a secure sandbox.

- [Two of my favorite problems at once](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/9/sprites-dev/#two-of-my-favorite-problems-at-once)

#### Developer sandboxes

I predicted earlier this week that [&#34;we’re due a Challenger disaster with respect to coding agent security&#34;](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-a-challenger-disaster-for-coding-agent-security) due to the terrifying way most of us are using coding agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI. Running them in `--dangerously-skip-permissions` mode (aka YOLO mode, where the agent acts without constantly seeking approval first) unlocks so much more power, but also means that a mistake or a malicious prompt injection can cause all sorts of damage to your system and data.

The safe way to run YOLO mode is in a robust sandbox, where the worst thing that can happen is the sandbox gets messed up and you have to throw it away and get another one.

That&#39;s the first problem Sprites solves:

```
curl https://sprites.dev/install.sh | bash

sprite login
sprite create my-dev-environment
sprite console -s my-dev-environment
```

That&#39;s all it takes to get SSH connected to a fresh environment, running in an ~8GB RAM, 8 CPU server. And... Claude Code and Codex and Gemini CLI and Python 3.13 and Node.js 22.20 and a bunch of other tools are already installed.

The first time you run `claude` it neatly signs you in to your existing account with Anthropic. The Sprites VM is persistent so future runs of `sprite console -s` will get you back to where you were before.

... and it automatically sets up port forwarding, so you can run a localhost server on your Sprite and access it from `localhost:8080` on your machine.

There&#39;s also a command you can run to assign a public URL to your Sprite, so anyone else can access it if they know the secret URL.

#### Storage and checkpoints

In [the blog post](https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/) Kurt Mackey argues that ephemeral, disposable sandboxes are not the best fit for coding agents:

&#62; The state of the art in agent isolation is a read-only sandbox. At Fly.io, we’ve been selling that story for years, and we’re calling it: ephemeral sandboxes are obsolete. Stop killing your sandboxes every time you use them. \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; If you force an agent to, it’ll work around containerization and do work . But you’re not helping the agent in any way by doing that. They don’t want containers. They don’t want “sandboxes”. They want computers.
&#62;
&#62; \[...\] with an actual computer, Claude doesn’t have to rebuild my entire development environment every time I pick up a PR.

Each Sprite gets a proper filesystem which persists in between sessions, even while the Sprite itself shuts down after inactivity. It sounds like they&#39;re doing some clever filesystem tricks here, I&#39;m looking forward to learning more about those in the future.

There are some clues on [the homepage](https://sprites.dev/):

&#62; You read and write to fast, directly attached NVMe storage. Your data then gets written to durable, external object storage. \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; You don&#39;t pay for allocated filesystem space, just the blocks you write. And it&#39;s all TRIM friendly, so your bill goes down when you delete things.

The really clever feature is checkpoints. You (or your coding agent) can trigger a checkpoint which takes around 300ms. This captures the entire disk state and can then be rolled back to later.

For more on how that works, run this in a Sprite:

```
cat /.sprite/docs/agent-context.md

```

Here&#39;s the relevant section:

```
## Checkpoints
- Point-in-time checkpoints and restores available
- Copy-on-write implementation for storage efficiency
- Last 5 checkpoints mounted at `/.sprite/checkpoints`
- Checkpoints capture only the writable overlay, not the base image

```

Or run this to see the `--help` for the command used to manage them:

```
sprite-env checkpoints --help
```

Which looks like this:

```
sprite-env checkpoints - Manage environment checkpoints

USAGE:
    sprite-env checkpoints &#60;subcommand&#62; [options]

SUBCOMMANDS:
    list [--history &#60;ver&#62;]  List all checkpoints (optionally filter by history version)
    get &#60;id&#62;                Get checkpoint details (e.g., v0, v1, v2)
    create                  Create a new checkpoint (auto-versioned)
    restore &#60;id&#62;            Restore from a checkpoint (e.g., v1)

NOTE:
    Checkpoints are versioned as v0, v1, v2, etc.
    Restore returns immediately and triggers an async restore that restarts the environment.
    The last 5 checkpoints are mounted at /.sprite/checkpoints for direct file access.

EXAMPLES:
    sprite-env checkpoints list
    sprite-env checkpoints list --history v1.2.3
    sprite-env checkpoints get v2
    sprite-env checkpoints create
    sprite-env checkpoints restore v1

```

#### Really clever use of Claude Skills

I&#39;m [a big fan of Skills](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/), the mechanism whereby Claude Code (and increasingly other agents too) can be given additional capabilities by describing them in Markdown files in a specific directory structure.

In a smart piece of design, Sprites uses pre-installed skills to teach Claude how Sprites itself works. This means you can ask Claude on the machine how to do things like open up ports and it will talk you through the process.

There&#39;s all sorts of interesting stuff in the `/.sprite` folder on that machine - digging in there is a great way to learn more about how Sprites works.

#### A sandbox API

Also from my predictions post earlier this week: [&#34;We’re finally going to solve sandboxing&#34;](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-we-re-finally-going-to-solve-sandboxing). I am obsessed with this problem: I want to be able to run untrusted code safely, both on my personal devices and in the context of web services I&#39;m building for other people to use.

I have _so many things_ I want to build that depend on being able to take untrusted code - from users or from LLMs or from LLMs-driven-by-users - and run that code in a sandbox where I can be confident that the blast radius if something goes wrong is tightly contained.

Sprites offers a clean [JSON API](https://sprites.dev/api) for doing exactly that, plus client libraries in [Go](https://github.com/superfly/sprites-go) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/superfly/sprites-js) and coming-soon [Python](https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py) and [Elixir](https://github.com/superfly/sprites-ex).

From their quick start:

```
# Create a new sprite
curl -X PUT https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/my-sprite \
-H &#34;Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN&#34;

# Execute a command
curl -X POST https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/my-sprite/exec \
-H &#34;Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN&#34; \
-d &#39;{&#34;command&#34;: &#34;echo hello&#34;}&#39;

```

You can also checkpoint and rollback via the API, so you can get your environment exactly how you like it, checkpoint it, run a bunch of untrusted code, then roll back to the clean checkpoint when you&#39;re done.

Managing network access is an important part of maintaining a good sandbox. The Sprites API lets you [configure network access policies](https://sprites.dev/api/sprites/policies) using a DNS-based allow/deny list like this:

```
curl -X POST \
  &#34;https://api.sprites.dev/v1/sprites/{name}/policy/network&#34; \
  -H &#34;Authorization: Bearer $SPRITES_TOKEN&#34; \
  -H &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34; \
  -d &#39;{
    &#34;rules&#34;: [
      {
        &#34;action&#34;: &#34;allow&#34;,
        &#34;domain&#34;: &#34;github.com&#34;
      },
      {
        &#34;action&#34;: &#34;allow&#34;,
        &#34;domain&#34;: &#34;*.npmjs.org&#34;
      }
    ]
  }&#39;
```

#### Scale-to-zero billing

Sprites have scale-to-zero baked into the architecture. They go to sleep after 30 seconds of inactivity, wake up quickly when needed and bill you for just the CPU hours, RAM hours and GB-hours of storage you use while the Sprite is awake.

Fly [estimate](https://sprites.dev/#billing) a 4 hour intensive coding session as costing around 46 cents, and a low traffic web app with 30 hours of wake time per month at ~$4.

(I calculate that a web app that consumes all 8 CPUs and all 8GBs of RAM 24/7 for a month would cost ((7 cents \* 8 \* 24 \* 30) + (4.375 cents \* 8 \* 24 \* 30)) / 100 = $655.2 per month, so don&#39;t necessarily use these as your primary web hosting solution for an app that soaks up all available CPU and RAM!)

#### Two of my favorite problems at once

I was hopeful that Fly would enter the developer-friendly sandbox API market, especially given other entrants from companies like [Cloudflare](https://sandbox.cloudflare.com/) and [Modal](https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandboxes) and [E2B](https://e2b.dev/).

I did not expect that they&#39;d tackle the developer sandbox problem at the same time, and with the same product!

My one concern here is that it makes the product itself a little harder to explain.

I&#39;m already spinning up some prototypes of sandbox-adjacent things I&#39;ve always wanted to build, and early signs are very promising. I&#39;ll write more about these as they turn into useful projects.

**Update**: Here&#39;s some [additional colour](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557825#46560748) from Thomas Ptacek on Hacker News:

&#62; This has been in the works for quite awhile here. We put a long bet on &#34;slow create fast start/stop&#34; --- which is a really interesting and useful shape for execution environments --- but it didn&#39;t make sense to sandboxers, so &#34;fast create&#34; has been the White Whale at Fly.io for over a year.

        <![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://daverupert.com/2026/01/algorithmic-hover-states-with-contrast-color/">my first post on <code>contrast-color()</code></a> I demo’d using <code>color-mix()</code> to change a background-color on hover, but I will be honest… mixing black and white isn’t always what you want. It would be cool and helpful to coerce  <code>contrast-color()</code> to return either <code>1</code> or <code>-1</code> so that we could adjust lightness in a color function on hover instead of only mixing white and black.</p>
        <p>Building on the inline CSS <code>if()</code> statements <a href="https://daverupert.com/2026/01/contrast-color-with-custom-design-tokens/">in my last post</a>, we can use the same trick to interpolate the result of <code>contrast-color()</code> into a number.</p>

      <source:markdown>In [my first post on `contrast-color()`](https://daverupert.com/2026/01/algorithmic-hover-states-with-contrast-color/) I demo’d using `color-mix()` to change a background-color on hover, but I will be honest… mixing black and white isn’t always what you want. It would be cool and helpful to coerce `contrast-color()` to return either `1` or `-1` so that we could adjust lightness in a color function on hover instead of only mixing white and black.

Building on the inline CSS `if()` statements [in my last post](https://daverupert.com/2026/01/contrast-color-with-custom-design-tokens/), we can use the same trick to interpolate the result of `contrast-color()` into a number.

Disclaimer: All caveats from the previous post about browser support, caching quirks, and expected syntax changes still apply.

See the Pen [contrast-color() powered design system colors](https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/myPogBv) by Dave Rupert ( [@davatron5000](https://codepen.io/davatron5000))
on [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

Ahh… feel that? Now our states maintains its harmonious color palette where mixing in white or black gets us a bit muddier results. We’re picking another note on the scale of the color’s lightness ramp.

The relevant CSS to make this trick work goes like this:

```
/* Needed for if() statement */
@property --captured-color {
  syntax: &#34;&#60;color&#62;&#34;;
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: white;
}

/* https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/ */
@function --contrast-color(--bg-color) {
  --l: clamp(0, (l / var(--l-threshold, 0.623) - 1) * -infinity, 1);
  result: oklch(from var(--bg) var(--l) 0 0);
}

button {
  background-color: var(--ds-button-bg);
	--captured-color: --contrast-color(var(--ds-button-bg));
  --lighter-or-darker: if(
    style(--captured-color: oklch(1 0 0)): 2.5; /* go extra lighter */
    else: -1; /* go darker */
  );
  ...

	&#38;:hover, &#38;:focus {
		background-color: oklch(
			from var(--ds-button-bg)
			calc(l + (0.1 * var(--lighter-or-darker))) c h
		);
  }
}

```

For comparison’s sake, I web-inspected up a little apples-to-apples, side-by-side of the [adjusting lightness way](https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/myPogBv) and the [color-mixing way](https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/bNpzYzX) of algorithmic hover states where it’s 10% lightened/darkened versus 10% mix of white/black.

![a side by side look at adjusting lightness vs mixing in white and black. the rest for all the buttons is on top and the hover state for all the buttons is on the bottom.

        <![CDATA[Today's links bunnie's piggyback hack: An actual "one weird trick" that's pretty fucking spectacular. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: "Keyboard Practice"; Sam Bulte says she's no dirtier than other MPs; Gene Luen Yang's Amabassador for Young People's Literature speech; Menstruation innovation. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. bunnie's piggyback hack (permalink) If Andrew "bunnie" Huang didn't actually exist, I'd swear he was a character out of a(n extraordinarily technologically well-informed) cyberpunk novel. Every time I interact with this legendary hardware hacker, he blows my mind with some incredible project or insight that permanently alters how I think about technology. I first met bunnie when he came to EFF for help with the threats he'd received from Microsoft. At the time, bunnie was an electrical engineering grad student at MIT, and he'd taken the bootloader locks on the new Xbox platform as a personal affront and challenge. He applied his prodigious skill and talent to these digital handcuffs, and in short order, he had broken the Xbox and installed Linux on it. MIT's general counsel immediately washed its hands of any responsibility to defend this young grad student from bullying by a corporate monopolist, hanging him out to dry. So he turned to us &#8211; and we got his back. You can read all about it in Hacking the Xbox, his canonical work about hardware hacking and technological freedom (it's free!): https://bunniefoo.com/nostarch/HackingTheXbox_Free.pdf In the many years since, I've been lucky enough to count bunnie as a friend, colleague and comrade, albeit one I only physically run into every year or so, usually at some tech event or on the playa at Burning Man, where he still camps with the MIT crew at The Institute. I just got to see bunnie in person again, over Christmas week at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg. He gave a late-night presentation with his collaborator Sean "xobs" Cross, entitled "Xous: A Pure-Rust Rethink of the Embedded Operating System": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbWWGkyIBGM Don't let the technical-sounding title intimidate you! This was a banger of a talk, and as with every bunnie Huang production, it left a pleasant and persistent aftertaste. The background for this talk is bunnie's obsession with building a trustworthy computer. For decades, bunnie has been chasing the dream of a computer whose every component &#8211; operating system, drivers, firmware, and hardware designs &#8211; are open to inspection. Bunnie's reasoning here is that anything that can't be inspected (and, by extension, modified) by its users is a spot where bad guys can hide bad stuff, and where lurking bugs can fester until they are exploited by bad guys. Remember the spectacular (and still mysterious) claims that Apple's servers had all been compromised with minuscule hardware bugs? The single best explanation of that you will find comes from bunnie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqQhWitJ1As Bunnie was doing all this before there was an "open source hardware" movement, and he remains at its vanguard. His "Precursor" project is a reference hardware platform where every component is open to inspection and modification, from the chassis to the random number generator: https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/category/betrusted/precursor/ One area of especial concern and interest for bunnie is the promise and peril of the "system-on-a-chip" (SoC). This is exactly what it sounds like: a cheap chip that incorporates everything you need to do full-fledged computing, including interfaces and drivers for networks, screens, peripherals, etc. SoCs are ubiquitous. You find them in things like individual car engine components and inkjet printer cartridges, and each one is a whole-ass computer, capable of running some really ugly malware. As bunnie explained back in 2020, there are two problems with SoCs: first, they are packaged such that the silicon traces inside of them can't be readily inspected, and second, they are so expensive to fabricate that someone like bunnie can't possibly come up with the millions needed to make an open, trustworthy, inspectable alternative: https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#precursor That's where bunnie's CCC talk comes in. The chips that SoCs are etched upon have lots of space (relatively speaking &#8211; we're talking about nanometer-scale circuits, after all). Even after an SoC designer packs in a ton of extra traces to handle oddball applications, the chip is still mostly "dark matter" &#8211; blank silicon. The first half of bunnie and xobs's talk concerns itself with "Xous," a secure operating system for an SoC, written in Rust. But the second half of the talk tackles the problem of procuring an SoC that you can trust to run Xous on. That's where this dark matter comes in. Bunnie's day-job is consulting on extremely gnarly, high-stakes, high-value hardware design and manufacturing, so naturally, he's got lots of clients and contacts in the SoC manufacturing world. He approached one of these companies with a proposal: let me tape out a whole separate chip that fits in the dark matter for one of your upcoming chips. Adding these traces adds virtually no cost to the production, and adding bunnie's chips to the production run actually saves the manufacturer money, because the prices drop when the quantities increase. The idea is to put two chips on the chip, and badge most of them with the OEM's branding, while a small rump of the chips will have bunnie's branding (he calls it the Baochip). On bunnie's chips, the traces to the OEM chip will be physically cut, meaning that the Baochips will just be Baochips &#8211; the original chip will be inaccessible and unusable. What's more, bunnie didn't just fit one chip into the OEM's "dark matter" &#8211; he fit five separate, specialized SoCs into the unused space. Remember, the beauty of SoCs is that once they're taped out and sent to production, the cost of an actual chip is peanuts, meaning that these Baochips are cheap as hell. Even better: the traces on these chips are scaled to be readily inspected using relatively low-cost equipment, meaning that many parties around the world can grab one of these chips, stick it in a machine, and compare the traces on the chip to the free, open sourcefile that was used to produce it, confirming that there are no nasty surprises lurking inside. This was such an exciting talk, and as I sat through it, I had this nagging feeling that it reminded me of something else I'd learned about years before, though I couldn't quite place it. Finally, as bunnie and xobs were stepping off the stage, I had it &#8211; it reminded me of another bunnie talk I'd seen &#8211; this one at The Institute, the MIT Burning Man camp, more than a decade prior. Back in 2015, bunnie designed and built a set of really cool, wearable radio-linked badges for his campmates, which would help them locate one another on the playa at night. These badges were really cool &#8211; they used a genetic algorithm to "have sex" with one another and mutate their color patterns. Bunnie even worked in a "consent" mechanism! https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2015/sex-circuits-deep-house/ But the really cool part that stuck with me was the manufacturing story. Bunnie wanted to fabricate custom injection-molded plastic enclosures for these pendants, but injection molding &#8211; like chip design &#8211; is a mass production phenomenon, with sky-high setup costs and incredibly cheap per-unit costs thereafter. So (and this might sound familiar) bunnie reached out to a die-maker that he worked with in China and said, "Hey, the next time you're contracted to mill out a die for a client, let me know if there's any extra space on the face of the die, and I'll provide you with a shapefile you can carve out of this 'dark matter.'" This doesn't add any cost to the die setup, and it means that bunnie can run just a couple dozen injection-molded, custom cases at a cost of pennies per unit. I grabbed bunnie later that night and mentioned this old Burning Man project to him and he said, "You know, I haven't ever thought of it, but you're right, there's definitely a throughline between the two projects." I asked him what he called this technique and he shrugged and said he didn't really have a name for it, but he thought of it as "piggybacking," which seems like a good name to me. It seems to me that these two kinds of manufacturing can't be the only ones that can be "piggybacked" onto. That's what motivated me to write this post &#8211; to get people thinking about these high-setup/low-unit cost production types that might be piggybacked for small batch, delightful projects like bunnie's. Well, that, and just to do one of my periodic bunnie Huang appreciation posts. If there's one person that I'd recommend people pay more attention to, it's him.

Upcoming books: Like I said, I&#39;ll keep writin&#39; &#39;em. Colophon: All the rest. bunnie&#39;s piggyback hack (permalink) If Andrew &#34;bunnie&#34; Huang didn&#39;t actually exist, I&#39;d swear he was a character out of a(n extraordinarily technologically well-informed) cyberpunk novel. Every time I interact with this legendary hardware hacker, he blows my mind with some incredible project or insight that permanently alters how I think about technology. I first met bunnie when he came to EFF for help with the threats he&#39;d received from Microsoft. At the time, bunnie was an electrical engineering grad student at MIT, and he&#39;d taken the bootloader locks on the new Xbox platform as a personal affront and challenge. He applied his prodigious skill and talent to these digital handcuffs, and in short order, he had broken the Xbox and installed Linux on it. MIT&#39;s general counsel immediately washed its hands of any responsibility to defend this young grad student from bullying by a corporate monopolist, hanging him out to dry. So he turned to us – and we got his back. You can read all about it in Hacking the Xbox, his canonical work about hardware hacking and technological freedom (it&#39;s free!): https://bunniefoo.com/nostarch/HackingTheXbox\_Free.pdf In the many years since, I&#39;ve been lucky enough to count bunnie as a friend, colleague and comrade, albeit one I only physically run into every year or so, usually at some tech event or on the playa at Burning Man, where he still camps with the MIT crew at The Institute. I just got to see bunnie in person again, over Christmas week at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg. He gave a late-night presentation with his collaborator Sean &#34;xobs&#34; Cross, entitled &#34;Xous: A Pure-Rust Rethink of the Embedded Operating System&#34;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbWWGkyIBGM Don&#39;t let the technical-sounding title intimidate you! This was a banger of a talk, and as with every bunnie Huang production, it left a pleasant and persistent aftertaste. The background for this talk is bunnie&#39;s obsession with building a trustworthy computer. For decades, bunnie has been chasing the dream of a computer whose every component – operating system, drivers, firmware, and hardware designs – are open to inspection. Bunnie&#39;s reasoning here is that anything that can&#39;t be inspected (and, by extension, modified) by its users is a spot where bad guys can hide bad stuff, and where lurking bugs can fester until they are exploited by bad guys. Remember the spectacular (and still mysterious) claims that Apple&#39;s servers had all been compromised with minuscule hardware bugs? The single best explanation of that you will find comes from bunnie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqQhWitJ1As Bunnie was doing all this before there was an &#34;open source hardware&#34; movement, and he remains at its vanguard. His &#34;Precursor&#34; project is a reference hardware platform where every component is open to inspection and modification, from the chassis to the random number generator: https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/category/betrusted/precursor/ One area of especial concern and interest for bunnie is the promise and peril of the &#34;system-on-a-chip&#34; (SoC). This is exactly what it sounds like: a cheap chip that incorporates everything you need to do full-fledged computing, including interfaces and drivers for networks, screens, peripherals, etc. SoCs are ubiquitous. You find them in things like individual car engine components and inkjet printer cartridges, and each one is a whole-ass computer, capable of running some really ugly malware. As bunnie explained back in 2020, there are two problems with SoCs: first, they are packaged such that the silicon traces inside of them can&#39;t be readily inspected, and second, they are so expensive to fabricate that someone like bunnie can&#39;t possibly come up with the millions needed to make an open, trustworthy, inspectable alternative: https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/10/dark-matter/#precursor That&#39;s where bunnie&#39;s CCC talk comes in. The chips that SoCs are etched upon have lots of space (relatively speaking – we&#39;re talking about nanometer-scale circuits, after all). Even after an SoC designer packs in a ton of extra traces to handle oddball applications, the chip is still mostly &#34;dark matter&#34; – blank silicon. The first half of bunnie and xobs&#39;s talk concerns itself with &#34;Xous,&#34; a secure operating system for an SoC, written in Rust. But the second half of the talk tackles the problem of procuring an SoC that you can trust to run Xous on. That&#39;s where this dark matter comes in. Bunnie&#39;s day-job is consulting on extremely gnarly, high-stakes, high-value hardware design and manufacturing, so naturally, he&#39;s got lots of clients and contacts in the SoC manufacturing world. He approached one of these companies with a proposal: let me tape out a whole separate chip that fits in the dark matter for one of your upcoming chips. Adding these traces adds virtually no cost to the production, and adding bunnie&#39;s chips to the production run actually saves the manufacturer money, because the prices drop when the quantities increase. The idea is to put two chips on the chip, and badge most of them with the OEM&#39;s branding, while a small rump of the chips will have bunnie&#39;s branding (he calls it the Baochip). On bunnie&#39;s chips, the traces to the OEM chip will be physically cut, meaning that the Baochips will just be Baochips – the original chip will be inaccessible and unusable. What&#39;s more, bunnie didn&#39;t just fit one chip into the OEM&#39;s &#34;dark matter&#34; – he fit five separate, specialized SoCs into the unused space. Remember, the beauty of SoCs is that once they&#39;re taped out and sent to production, the cost of an actual chip is peanuts, meaning that these Baochips are cheap as hell. Even better: the traces on these chips are scaled to be readily inspected using relatively low-cost equipment, meaning that many parties around the world can grab one of these chips, stick it in a machine, and compare the traces on the chip to the free, open sourcefile that was used to produce it, confirming that there are no nasty surprises lurking inside. This was such an exciting talk, and as I sat through it, I had this nagging feeling that it reminded me of something else I&#39;d learned about years before, though I couldn&#39;t quite place it. Finally, as bunnie and xobs were stepping off the stage, I had it – it reminded me of another bunnie talk I&#39;d seen – this one at The Institute, the MIT Burning Man camp, more than a decade prior. Back in 2015, bunnie designed and built a set of really cool, wearable radio-linked badges for his campmates, which would help them locate one another on the playa at night. These badges were really cool – they used a genetic algorithm to &#34;have sex&#34; with one another and mutate their color patterns. Bunnie even worked in a &#34;consent&#34; mechanism! https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2015/sex-circuits-deep-house/ But the really cool part that stuck with me was the manufacturing story. Bunnie wanted to fabricate custom injection-molded plastic enclosures for these pendants, but injection molding – like chip design – is a mass production phenomenon, with sky-high setup costs and incredibly cheap per-unit costs thereafter. So (and this might sound familiar) bunnie reached out to a die-maker that he worked with in China and said, &#34;Hey, the next time you&#39;re contracted to mill out a die for a client, let me know if there&#39;s any extra space on the face of the die, and I&#39;ll provide you with a shapefile you can carve out of this &#39;dark matter.&#39;&#34; This doesn&#39;t add any cost to the die setup, and it means that bunnie can run just a couple dozen injection-molded, custom cases at a cost of pennies per unit. I grabbed bunnie later that night and mentioned this old Burning Man project to him and he said, &#34;You know, I haven&#39;t ever thought of it, but you&#39;re right, there&#39;s definitely a throughline between the two projects.&#34; I asked him what he called this technique and he shrugged and said he didn&#39;t really have a name for it, but he thought of it as &#34;piggybacking,&#34; which seems like a good name to me. It seems to me that these two kinds of manufacturing can&#39;t be the only ones that can be &#34;piggybacked&#34; onto. That&#39;s what motivated me to write this post – to get people thinking about these high-setup/low-unit cost production types that might be piggybacked for small batch, delightful projects like bunnie&#39;s. Well, that, and just to do one of my periodic bunnie Huang appreciation posts. If there&#39;s one person that I&#39;d recommend people pay more attention to, it&#39;s him. He&#39;s also a terrific communicator, and an indecently great writer. My readers might be familiar with him thanks to the afterword he contributed to Little Brother: https://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/ More recently, he wrote a fantastic intro for last year&#39;s Science Comics Computers: How Digital Computers Work, a brilliant middle-grades graphic novel that uses steampunk dinosaurs to explain digital logic and the building blocks of computation: https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/05/xor-xand-xnor-nand-nor/#brawniac He also co-authored a fascinating research paper with Edward Snowden, after the two of them collaborated on a daughter-board that spots otherwise untraceable malware: https://assets.pubpub.org/aacpjrja/AgainstTheLaw-CounteringLawfulAbusesofDigitalSurveillance.pdf Again, my readers will recognize this as a gimmick from my 2020 novel Attack Surface (a Little Brother novel for adults): https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757517/attacksurface/ That&#39;s not bunnie&#39;s only sweet hardware hack, of course.

Unfortunately, barring any future updates from the maintainers, it seems like [Mailhog has not been maintained](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/issues/466) for four years now.

      <title>Using your design system colors with contrast-color()</title>
      <link>https://daverupert.com/2026/01/contrast-color-with-custom-design-tokens/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>One predictable pain point with <code>contrast-color()</code> is that it only returns <code>black</code> and <code>white</code> named colors. From a design systems perspective, that’s not ideal because you want <em>your</em> colors. You want your harmonious brand and the colors you and your team spent thousands of man hours in meetings deciding on. Those colors.</p>
        <p>In fact, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/exploring-color-contrast-for-the-first-time/">an earlier version of Safari had <code>color-contrast()</code></a> (confusing I know, naming is hard) which allowed you to pass in a list of best candidates to choose from. I beleive that proposal got mired in standards discussions, color contrast algorithms, and competing proposals; and <code>contrast-color()</code> is what survived which got simplified down to a binary result.</p>
        <p>In the future though, we can use <code>contrast-color()</code> and <code>if()</code> together to help pick the value we want. Alas, at the time of writing no browser supports both <code>if()</code> and <code>contrast-color()</code>.  But we can use <a href="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/">Lea Verou’s <code>--contrast-color()</code> workaround</a> to experiment with how this will work in Chromium today.</p>
        <p class="codepen" data-height="500" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="myPogBv" data-pen-title="contrast-color() powered design system colors " data-user="davatron5000" style="height: 500px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

      <source:markdown>One predictable pain point with `contrast-color()` is that it only returns `black` and `white` named colors. From a design systems perspective, that’s not ideal because you want _your_ colors. You want your harmonious brand and the colors you and your team spent thousands of man hours in meetings deciding on. Those colors.

In fact, [an earlier version of Safari had `color-contrast()`](https://css-tricks.com/exploring-color-contrast-for-the-first-time/) (confusing I know, naming is hard) which allowed you to pass in a list of best candidates to choose from. I beleive that proposal got mired in standards discussions, color contrast algorithms, and competing proposals; and `contrast-color()` is what survived which got simplified down to a binary result.

In the future though, we can use `contrast-color()` and `if()` together to help pick the value we want. Alas, at the time of writing no browser supports both `if()` and `contrast-color()`. But we can use [Lea Verou’s `--contrast-color()` workaround](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/) to experiment with how this will work in Chromium today.

See the Pen [contrast-color() powered design system colors](https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/myPogBv) by Dave Rupert ( [@davatron5000](https://codepen.io/davatron5000))
on [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

The CSS to get this working looks something like this:

```
@property --captured-color {
  syntax: &#34;&#60;color&#62;&#34;;
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: white;
}

/* https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/ */
@function --contrast-color(--bg-color) {
  --l: clamp(0, (l / var(--l-threshold, 0.623) - 1) * -infinity, 1);
  result: oklch(from var(--bg) var(--l) 0 0);
}

:root {
  --ds-text-white: wheat;
  --ds-text-black: darkslategray;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--ds-button-bg);
  --captured-color: --contrast-color(var(--ds-button-bg));

  color: if(
     style(--captured-color: oklch(1 0 0)): var(--ds-text-white);
     else: var(--ds-text-black);
  );
}

```

And that’s it! Using (a form of) `contrast-color()` you can select the proper tokens from your design system. Cool.

One quirky bit needed to make it work is defining a type for `--captured-color` using CSS `@property`, [a trick I learned from Roma Komarov](https://blog.kizu.dev/captured-custom-properties/). To be honest I don’t fully understand _the why_ behind Registered Custom Properties and the [Computed Value Time Behavior](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-properties-values-api/#calculation-of-computed-values) superpower, but my simple brain created a rule “If you’re going to compare a variable to a `&#60;color&#62;` in a CSS `if()` statement, make sure to register the variable as a `&#60;color&#62;`.”

If/when any of the browsers start supporting both features, I expect we’ll have to update `oklch(1 0 0)` in the style query to `white` or `rgb(255 255 255)`. At least, I hope it works that way.

One unexpected challenge that I encountered with this demo was that if I abstracted out the `if` statement out into its own custom function, it would break. I’m not 100% sure why but I think it’s based on how CSS functions cache results. I’ll have to dig into this more, but I’m happy the inline `if` statement works. Hopefully someone smarter can figure it out.

      <title>LLM predictions for 2026, shared with Oxide and Friends</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I joined a recording of the Oxide and Friends podcast on Tuesday to talk about 1, 3 and 6 year predictions for the tech industry. This is my second appearance on their annual predictions episode, you can see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/10/ai-predictions/">my predictions from January 2025 here</a>. Here's <a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/predictions-2026">the page for this year's episode</a>, with options to listen in all of your favorite podcast apps or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8">directly on YouTube</a>.</p>
        <p>Bryan Cantrill started the episode by declaring that he's never been so unsure about what's coming in the next year. I share that uncertainty - the significant advances in coding agents just in the last two months have left me certain that things will change significantly, but unclear as to what those changes will be.</p>
        <p>Here are the predictions I shared in the episode.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-it-will-become-undeniable-that-llms-write-good-code">1 year: It will become undeniable that LLMs write good code</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-we-re-finally-going-to-solve-sandboxing">1 year: We're finally going to solve sandboxing</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-a-challenger-disaster-for-coding-agent-security">1 year: A "Challenger disaster" for coding agent security</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-k-k-p-parrots-will-have-an-outstanding-breeding-season">1 year: Kākāpō parrots will have an outstanding breeding season</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-the-coding-agents-jevons-paradox-for-software-engineering-will-resolve-one-way-or-the-other">3 years: the coding agents Jevons paradox for software engineering will resolve, one way or the other</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-someone-will-build-a-new-browser-using-mainly-ai-assisted-coding-and-it-won-t-even-be-a-surprise">3 years: Someone will build a new browser using mainly AI-assisted coding and it won't even be a surprise</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#6-years-typing-code-by-hand-will-go-the-way-of-punch-cards">6 years: Typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="1-year-it-will-become-undeniable-that-llms-write-good-code">1 year: It will become undeniable that LLMs write good code <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=1167s" class="predictions-video-link">▶ 19:27</a></h4>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I think that there are still people out there who are convinced that LLMs cannot write good code. Those people are in for a very nasty shock in 2026. I do not think it will be possible to get to the end of even the next three months while still holding on to that idea that the code they write is all junk and it's it's likely any decent human programmer will write better code than they will.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In 2023, saying that LLMs write garbage code was entirely correct. For most of 2024 that stayed true. In 2025 that changed, but you could be forgiven for continuing to hold out. In 2026 the quality of LLM-generated code will become impossible to deny.</p>
        <p>I base this on my own experience - I've spent more time exploring <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">AI-assisted programming</a> than most.</p>
        <p>The key change in 2025 (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#the-year-of-reasoning-">my overview for the year</a>) was the introduction of "reasoning models" trained specifically against code using Reinforcement Learning. The major labs spent a full year competing with each other on who could get the best code capabilities from their models, and that problem turns out to be perfectly attuned to RL since code challenges come with built-in verifiable success conditions.</p>
        <p>Since Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 came out in November and December respectively the amount of code I've written by hand has dropped to a single digit percentage of my overall output. The same is true for many other expert programmers I know.</p>
        <p>At this point if you continue to argue that LLMs write useless code you're damaging your own credibility.</p>
        <h4 id="1-year-we-re-finally-going-to-solve-sandboxing">1 year: We're finally going to solve sandboxing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=1205s" class="predictions-video-link">▶ 20:05</a></h4>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I think this year is the year we're going to solve sandboxing. I want to run code other people have written on my computing devices without it destroying my computing devices if it's malicious or has bugs. [...] It's crazy that it's 2026 and I still <code>pip install</code> random code and then execute it in a way that it can steal all of my data and delete all my files.

      </description>
      <source:markdown>I joined a recording of the Oxide and Friends podcast on Tuesday to talk about 1, 3 and 6 year predictions for the tech industry. This is my second appearance on their annual predictions episode, you can see [my predictions from January 2025 here](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/10/ai-predictions/). Here&#39;s [the page for this year&#39;s episode](https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/predictions-2026), with options to listen in all of your favorite podcast apps or [directly on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8).

Bryan Cantrill started the episode by declaring that he&#39;s never been so unsure about what&#39;s coming in the next year. I share that uncertainty - the significant advances in coding agents just in the last two months have left me certain that things will change significantly, but unclear as to what those changes will be.

Here are the predictions I shared in the episode.

- [1 year: It will become undeniable that LLMs write good code](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-it-will-become-undeniable-that-llms-write-good-code)

- [1 year: Kākāpō parrots will have an outstanding breeding season](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-k-k-p-parrots-will-have-an-outstanding-breeding-season)
- [3 years: the coding agents Jevons paradox for software engineering will resolve, one way or the other](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-the-coding-agents-jevons-paradox-for-software-engineering-will-resolve-one-way-or-the-other)
- [3 years: Someone will build a new browser using mainly AI-assisted coding and it won&#39;t even be a surprise](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-someone-will-build-a-new-browser-using-mainly-ai-assisted-coding-and-it-won-t-even-be-a-surprise)
- [6 years: Typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#6-years-typing-code-by-hand-will-go-the-way-of-punch-cards)

#### 1 year: It will become undeniable that LLMs write good code [▶ 19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&#38;t=1167s)

&#62; I think that there are still people out there who are convinced that LLMs cannot write good code. Those people are in for a very nasty shock in 2026. I do not think it will be possible to get to the end of even the next three months while still holding on to that idea that the code they write is all junk and it&#39;s it&#39;s likely any decent human programmer will write better code than they will.

In 2023, saying that LLMs write garbage code was entirely correct. For most of 2024 that stayed true. In 2025 that changed, but you could be forgiven for continuing to hold out. In 2026 the quality of LLM-generated code will become impossible to deny.

I base this on my own experience - I&#39;ve spent more time exploring [AI-assisted programming](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/) than most.

The key change in 2025 (see [my overview for the year](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#the-year-of-reasoning-)) was the introduction of &#34;reasoning models&#34; trained specifically against code using Reinforcement Learning. The major labs spent a full year competing with each other on who could get the best code capabilities from their models, and that problem turns out to be perfectly attuned to RL since code challenges come with built-in verifiable success conditions.

Since Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 came out in November and December respectively the amount of code I&#39;ve written by hand has dropped to a single digit percentage of my overall output. The same is true for many other expert programmers I know.

At this point if you continue to argue that LLMs write useless code you&#39;re damaging your own credibility.

#### 1 year: We&#39;re finally going to solve sandboxing [▶ 20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&#38;t=1205s)

&#62; I think this year is the year we&#39;re going to solve sandboxing. I want to run code other people have written on my computing devices without it destroying my computing devices if it&#39;s malicious or has bugs. \[...\] It&#39;s crazy that it&#39;s 2026 and I still `pip install` random code and then execute it in a way that it can steal all of my data and delete all my files. \[...\] I don&#39;t want to run a piece of code on any of my devices that somebody else wrote outside of sandbox ever again.

This isn&#39;t just about LLMs, but it becomes even more important now there are so many more people writing code often without knowing what they&#39;re doing. Sandboxing is also a key part of the battle against prompt injection.

We have a _lot_ of promising technologies in play already for this - containers and WebAssembly being the two I&#39;m most optimistic about. There&#39;s real commercial value involved in solving this problem. The pieces are there, what&#39;s needed is UX work to reduce the friction in using them productively and securely.

#### 1 year: A &#34;Challenger disaster&#34; for coding agent security [▶ 21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&#38;t=1281s)

&#62; I think we&#39;re due a Challenger disaster with respect to coding agent security\[...\] I think so many people, myself included, are running these coding agents practically as root, right? We&#39;re letting them do all of this stuff. And every time I do it, my computer doesn&#39;t get wiped. I&#39;m like, &#34;oh, it&#39;s fine&#34;.

I used this as an opportunity to promote my favourite recent essay about AI security, [the Normalization of Deviance in AI](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/the-normalization-of-deviance-in-ai/) by Johann Rehberger.

The Normalization of Deviance describes the phenomenon where people and organizations get used to operating in an unsafe manner because nothing bad has happened to them yet, which can result in enormous problems (like the 1986 Challenger disaster) when their luck runs out.

Every six months I predict that a headline-grabbing prompt injection attack is coming soon, and every six months it doesn&#39;t happen. This is my most recent version of that prediction!

#### 1 year: Kākāpō parrots will have an outstanding breeding season [▶ 50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&#38;t=3006s)

(I dropped this one to lighten the mood after a discussion of the deep sense of existential dread that many programmers are feeling right now!)

&#62; I think that Kākāpō parrots in New Zealand are going to have an outstanding breeding season. The reason I think this is that the Rimu trees are in fruit right now. There&#39;s only 250 of them, and they only breed if the Rimu trees have a good fruiting. The Rimu trees have been terrible since 2019, but this year the Rimu trees were all blooming. There are researchers saying that all 87 females of breeding age might lay an egg. And for a species with only 250 remaining parrots that&#39;s great news.

(I just [checked Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81k%C4%81p%C5%8D#Population_timeline) and I was right with the parrot numbers but wrong about the last good breeding season, apparently 2022 was a good year too.)

In a year with precious little in the form of good news I am utterly delighted to share this story. Here&#39;s more:

I don&#39;t often use AI-generated images on this blog, but the Kākāpō image the Oxide team created for this episode is just _perfect_:

![A beautiful green Kākāpō surrounded by candles gazes into a crystal ball](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/oxide-kakapo.jpg)

#### 3 years: the coding agents Jevons paradox for software engineering will resolve, one way or the other [▶ 54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&#38;t=3277s)

&#62; We will find out if the [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) saves our careers or not. This is a big question that anyone who&#39;s a software engineer has right now: we are driving the cost of actually producing working code down to a fraction of what it used to cost. Does that mean that our careers are completely devalued and we all have to learn to live on a tenth of our incomes, or does it mean that the demand for software, for custom software goes up by a factor of 10 and now our skills are even _more_ valuable because you can hire me and I can build you 10 times the software I used to be able to?

I&#39;m crossing my fingers for the latter! So far it feels to me like it&#39;s working out that way.

#### 3 years: Someone will build a new browser using mainly AI-assisted coding and it won&#39;t even be a surprise [▶ 65:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&#38;t=3913s)

&#62; I think somebody will have built a full web browser mostly using AI assistance, and it won&#39;t even be surprising. Rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine\[...\] the cheat code is the conformance suites. If there are existing tests that it&#39;ll get so much easier.

A common complaint today from AI coding skeptics is that LLMs are fine for toy projects but can&#39;t be used for anything large and serious.

I think within 3 years that will be comprehensively proven incorrect, to the point that it won&#39;t even be controversial anymore.

I picked a web browser here because so much of the work building a browser involves writing code that has to conform to an enormous and daunting selection of both formal tests and informal websites-in-the-wild.

Coding agents are _really good_ at tasks where you can define a concrete goal and then set them to work iterating in that direction.

A web browser is the most ambitious project I can think of that leans into those capabilities.

#### 6 years: Typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards [▶ 80:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&#38;t=4839s)

&#62; I think the job of being paid money to type code into a computer will go the same way as punching punch cards \[...\] in six years time, I do not think anyone will be paid to just to do the thing where you type the code.

        <p>The code above will dim your button on <code>:hover</code> 10% by mixing in black. But what if our Buttons are already dark (black, navy, etc)? In that situation we want to lighten the background-color instead of dimming. We can glue on new classes like <code>button.lighten-on-hover</code> or <code>button.invert-hover</code> and that works… until we get to light and dark theme modes of our Button where you probably want to lighten/darken oppositely depending on the mode…</p>
        <p>Ugh. In that situation you’d have <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>, <code>[data-theme=&quot;dark&quot;]</code> styles in your Button styles and people are mad now because the Button styles are too complex. There’s got to be a better way!</p>

      <source:markdown>Firefox 146 added support for [`contrast-color()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/color_value/contrast-color) joining Safari 26 in the First Implementor’s Club. For those unfamiliar, `contrast-color(&#60;color&#62;)` is a new CSS function that will take a `&#60;color&#62;` as input and returns either `white` or `black` depending on which has the most contrast.

The quintessential example is choosing a foreground text `color` with the best contrast.

```
button {
	--button-bg: red;
	background: var(--button-bg);
	color: contrast-color(var(--button-bg));
	/* @returns black (5.25:1 WCAG AA Pass)
			not white (3.99:1 WCAG AA Fail) */
}

```

If someone changes `--button-bg` to purple, the foreground color automatically resolves to the either white or black, whichever has more contrast. It avoids having to set an extra token for color and takes the guess work out of picking an accessible foreground color.

I think this is going to be an incredible boon to design systems where I don’t control what `--button-bg` is, but I do care about providing accessible experiences. And I think that’s the goal of this feature; to have “smart defaults” that lead to more accessible websites, easier algorithmically-driven color systems, and better “theme a whole website from a single color picker” demos.

## Sure contrast-color() can do foreground colors, but what about backgrounds?

We’re having conversations at work about algorithmically driven rest/hover/active states for Buttons. In the current [Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline/) you can use `color-mix()` to lighten/darken colors on `:hover`…

```
button {
	background-color: var(--button-bg);
	color: contrast-color(var(--button-bg));

	&#38;:hover, &#38;:focus {
		background-color: color-mix(
			in srgb,
			var(--button-bg) 90%,
			black 10%
		)
	}
}

```

The code above will dim your button on `:hover` 10% by mixing in black. But what if our Buttons are already dark (black, navy, etc)? In that situation we want to lighten the background-color instead of dimming. We can glue on new classes like `button.lighten-on-hover` or `button.invert-hover` and that works… until we get to light and dark theme modes of our Button where you probably want to lighten/darken oppositely depending on the mode…

Ugh. In that situation you’d have `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`, `[data-theme=&#34;dark&#34;]` styles in your Button styles and people are mad now because the Button styles are too complex. There’s got to be a better way!

Well, do I have good news for you…

See the Pen [contrast-color() powered lighten/darken bg on hover](https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/bNpzYzX) by Dave Rupert ( [@davatron5000](https://codepen.io/davatron5000))
on [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

Per my previous conversations, I wondered if we could use `contrast-color()` to programmatically lighten/darken an button based on its current `background-color`. If the Button is black, and the contrast-color is white, let’s mix in white (and vice versa):

```
:root {
	color-scheme: light dark;
	--button-bg: light-dark(navyblue, lightpurple);
}

button {
	background-color: var(--button-bg);
	color: color-contrast(var(--button-bg));

	&#38;:hover, &#38;:focus {
		background-color: color-mix(
			in srgb,
			var(--button-bg) 75%,
			contrast-color(var(--button-bg)) 10%
		)
	}
}

```

Huzzah! Now our Button’s hover states go in the desired direction and our foreground `color` is intrinsically styled based on its own `background-color`. Nice. From a design systems perspective I’m pretty excited about the possibility to remove a bunch of state-based tokens from our collection.

### Now available in… everywhere?

This approach only works in Safari and Firefox. However, if I use [Lea Verou’s method of polyfilling `contrast-color()`](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/contrast-color/), we can pop in a custom `@function --contrast-color()` that works in Chromium 139+. The final working solution looks like this:

```
/* @function supported in Chromium */
@function --contrast-color(--bg-color) {
  --l: clamp(0, (l / var(--l-threshold, 0.623) - 1) * -infinity, 1);
  result: oklch(from var(--bg-color) var(--l) 0 h);
}

button {
  /* contrast-color() supported in Safari &#38; Firefox */
  --button-fg: contrast-color(var(--button-bg));

  @supports not (color: contrast-color(red)) {
    --button-fg: --contrast-color(var(--button-bg));
  }

  background: var(--button-bg);
  color: var(--button-fg);

  &#38;:hover,
  &#38;:focus{
    background-color: color-mix(
      in srgb,
      var(--button-bg) 75%,
      var(--button-fg) 10%
    );
  }
}

```

Depending on your browser matrix, this may work for you. It’s probably a _smidge_ too new for us to roll out to customers, right now but for personal sites heck yeah.

This is interesting tech and I’m excited to dig in more. And spoiler alert, this is the first post in a small little series I have already written up for you.</source:markdown>

Hello and welcome to **A Newsletter of Humorous Writing**, a roundup of the week&#39;s finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. It’s only January 8th but we’re pleased to announce that we’ve already completed one of our major goals of 2026: Getting our heads unstuck from the way-too-small turtleneck sweaters we bought each other for Christmas.

## What We Enjoyed This Week

[**I Know We Don’t All See Eye-to-Eye About the Office Cobra**](https://www.pointsincase.com/articles/i-know-we-dont-all-see-eye-to-eye-about-the-office-cobra?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-425) **by** [**Jim Marino**](https://jamesjmarino.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-425) _(Points in Case)_ We love the dynamic here, with the narrator trying to be very tactful and reasonable about something that is extremely unreasonable. Jim also does a great job exploring many different, unexpected effects that the cobra has on this workplace, including on the decor: “At this point I don’t think it’s necessary to show us more baby pictures of the cobra. I think there are enough framed photographs on the office walls, visible from every work station, for us to be familiar with how the snake looked.”

      <title>Was the ICE murder pre-calculated?</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>When there's breaking news these days I check Fox News in addition to CNN, MSNOW, BBC, PBS. The best are the last two. But last night night when everyone was fixated on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Renee_Good">story</a> of Renee Nicole Good, the woman who was killed in cold blood, on video, by a masked ICE thug, I wondered what Fox was saying. They were showing the actual video over and over like the other networks. Their words were what Trump was saying, but they didn't hide what actually happened, at least as long as it's news. </p>
        <p>Then I wondered how much this was pre-calculated. It clearly doesn't hurt ICE to signal that they're killing US citizens in the US with impunity. Next time will be soon, and it will be more than one dead, and maybe they'll be kids. What makes me think this was not planned by the higher-ups is that they killed a middle-aged white woman, mother of 3,, who writes poetry. Not a very likely cartel leader or narco-terrorist. There were dolls in the glove compartment of the car. </p>
        <p>Every indication is that she was just afraid and trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. </p>
        <p>We also remember that in the aftermath of Jan 6, private texts from the top people at Fox indicated they were scared and appalled like most other relatively sane Americans. What had happened then was unthinkable. Well, what happened yesterday was just as unthinkable. Shocking. Makes you wonder what's next. Get ready, we're going to see a lot of ugliness now, hard to comprehend, hard to accept. We still have a skeletal democracy, and ICE isn't fully staffed yet (they have new billions of dollars to spend).</p>

        <p>I responded: "Or it's a test of it. The guy wasn't very well disguised, I think he will be identified if he hasn't already been identified. Will he be arrested and tried? If yes, then we just validated the rule-based order. If no, we're fucked.</p>
        <p>"Or even better the state of Minnesota could go to court and sue ICE to get their officers to wear identifying information, and no masks. For just this reason. And then here's an arrest warrant for the guy who fired his gun 3 times at the head of a 37-year old mom who writes poetry and drives an SUV with teddy bears in the glove compartment. In other words I'm not sure this was intentional (on behalf of ICE), and I think they may have to turn this guy over, otherwise someone is getting impeached. The video is too compelling."</p>]]>

      <title>How Google Got Its Groove Back and Edged Ahead of OpenAI</title>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-ai-openai-gemini-chatgpt-b766e160">How Google Got Its Groove Back and Edged Ahead of OpenAI</a></strong></p>
        I picked up a few interesting tidbits from this Wall Street Journal piece on Google's recent hard won success with Gemini.</p>
        <p>Here's the origin of the name "Nano Banana":</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Naina Raisinghani, known inside Google for working late into the night, needed a name for the new tool to complete the upload. It was 2:30 a.m., though, and nobody was around. So she just made one up, a mashup of two nicknames friends had given her: Nano Banana.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The WSJ credit OpenAI's Daniel Selsam with un-retiring Sergei Brin:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Around that time, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who had recently retired, was at a party chatting with a researcher from OpenAI named Daniel Selsam, according to people familiar with the conversation. Why, Selsam asked him, wasn’t he working full time on AI. Hadn’t the launch of ChatGPT captured his imagination as a computer scientist?</p>
        <p>ChatGPT was on its way to becoming a household name in AI chatbots, while Google was still fumbling to get its product off the ground. Brin decided Selsam had a point and returned to work.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And we get some rare concrete user numbers:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>By October, Gemini had more than 650 million monthly users, up from 450 million in July.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The LLM usage number I see cited most often is OpenAI's 800 million weekly active users for ChatGPT. That's from October 6th at OpenAI DevDay so it's comparable to these Gemini numbers, albeit not directly since it's weekly rather than monthly actives.</p>
        <p>I'm also never sure what counts as a "Gemini user" - does interacting via Google Docs or Gmail count or do you need to be using a Gemini chat interface directly?</p>
        <p><strong>Update 17th January 2025</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/lunixa380/status/2012610344741412909">@LunixA380 pointed out</a> that this 650m user figure comes from the <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/news/news-details/2025/Alphabet-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Results-2025-mIRgD3AI4A/default.aspx">Alphabet 2025 Q3 earnings report</a> which says this (emphasis mine):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Alphabet had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We delivered our first-ever $100 billion quarter," said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google.</p>
        <p>"[...] In addition to topping leaderboards, our first party models, like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute, via direct API use by our customers. <strong>The Gemini App now has over 650 million monthly active users</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Presumably the "Gemini App" encompasses the Android and iPhone apps as well as direct visits to <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">gemini.google.com</a> - that seems to be the indication from Google's <a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/gemini/gemini-3/">November 18th blog post</a> that also mentioned the 650m number.

I picked up a few interesting tidbits from this Wall Street Journal piece on Google&#39;s recent hard won success with Gemini.

Here&#39;s the origin of the name &#34;Nano Banana&#34;:

&#62; Naina Raisinghani, known inside Google for working late into the night, needed a name for the new tool to complete the upload. It was 2:30 a.m., though, and nobody was around. So she just made one up, a mashup of two nicknames friends had given her: Nano Banana.

The WSJ credit OpenAI&#39;s Daniel Selsam with un-retiring Sergei Brin:

&#62; Around that time, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who had recently retired, was at a party chatting with a researcher from OpenAI named Daniel Selsam, according to people familiar with the conversation. Why, Selsam asked him, wasn’t he working full time on AI. Hadn’t the launch of ChatGPT captured his imagination as a computer scientist?
&#62;
&#62; ChatGPT was on its way to becoming a household name in AI chatbots, while Google was still fumbling to get its product off the ground. Brin decided Selsam had a point and returned to work.

And we get some rare concrete user numbers:

&#62; By October, Gemini had more than 650 million monthly users, up from 450 million in July.

The LLM usage number I see cited most often is OpenAI&#39;s 800 million weekly active users for ChatGPT. That&#39;s from October 6th at OpenAI DevDay so it&#39;s comparable to these Gemini numbers, albeit not directly since it&#39;s weekly rather than monthly actives.

I&#39;m also never sure what counts as a &#34;Gemini user&#34; - does interacting via Google Docs or Gmail count or do you need to be using a Gemini chat interface directly?

**Update 17th January 2025**: [@LunixA380 pointed out](https://twitter.com/lunixa380/status/2012610344741412909) that this 650m user figure comes from the [Alphabet 2025 Q3 earnings report](https://abc.xyz/investor/news/news-details/2025/Alphabet-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Results-2025-mIRgD3AI4A/default.aspx) which says this (emphasis mine):

&#62; &#34;Alphabet had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We delivered our first-ever $100 billion quarter,&#34; said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google.
&#62;
&#62; &#34;\[...\] In addition to topping leaderboards, our first party models, like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute, via direct API use by our customers. **The Gemini App now has over 650 million monthly active users**.

Presumably the &#34;Gemini App&#34; encompasses the Android and iPhone apps as well as direct visits to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com/) \- that seems to be the indication from Google&#39;s [November 18th blog post](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/gemini/gemini-3/) that also mentioned the 650m number.

      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/08/after-the-moneys-gone/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links Where did the money go? Turning a mountain of (their) money into a pile of (your) money. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Revolutionary Colossus; T-Mobile CEO v EFF; Broadband isn't gasoline. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Where did the money go? (permalink) America is trudging through its third consecutive K-shaped recovery (an economic rally where the rich get richer and everyone else gets poorer). The rich have never been richer, and the debt-fueled consumption that kept the economy going is tapering down to a trickle. This isn't down to the iron laws of economics or the great forces of history. It's because we made rules that let rich people steal from everyone else, including local, state and federal tax authorities, and also workers, customers and suppliers (and society at large). From junk fees to wage theft to greedflation, politicians have thumbed the scales in favor of scumbags who drain the wealth of workers and remit it to parasites. These crooks and hustlers keep coming up with ways to squeeze a few more drops out of us. They come up with gimmicks like buy now/pay later (and then slam us with massive fees when we can't pay later), or margin-based gambling on cryptocurrency or "prediction markets," both of which are crooked poker tables where you are always the sucker and the house always wins. The Trump administration didn't invent the idea of government-supported scams and hustles, but they sure supercharged it. Trump rips off his supporters like crazy &#8211; as anyone who's long on $TRUMPcoin knows &#8211; and surrounds himself with "businessmen" notorious for scamming workers, customers, and the government itself. But even as Trump throws his support behind hustlers and con artists, he's also backing debt-collectors, whether they're chasing student debt, medical debt, or the spiraling penalties for missing the fourth payment on your Klarna. Broadly, these are the two industries in America now: scammers who put Americans into debt, and industries who torment Americans into paying the debt. And while these two industries represent a moral crisis for the nation, they also represent an economic crisis, because they are at irreconcilable odds with one another. If you're in the business of scamming Americans so they go into debt, you want your suckers to have money (so they can give it to you). But if you're in the business of collecting the losses that Americans incur at the hands of scammers, then you're at odds with those scammers themselves &#8211; every dollar you collect on the debt from the last scam is a dollar that can't be lost to the next scam. This is what gave us the Great Financial Crisis: scumbag bankers tricked people into taking out unsustainable mortgages whose "teaser rates" would blow up after a couple years to levels that the borrower couldn't possibly pay back. But the lenders didn't care, because they were only "loan originators" who could pass those loans off to "investors" via exotic financial instruments. These two groups had an irreconcilable conflict: the people making the loans could only keep their scam going so long as the people collecting the loans didn't demand repayment. But these two groups &#8211; scammers and arm-breakers &#8211; aren't the only two groups in the economy. There's a third group that you might call, "People who want to make useful things that we like and pay for." This third group is at odds with both the scammers and the arm-breakers, because their potential customers are being tricked (by scammers) and bankrupted (by arm-breakers). Say you want to go into business renting hotel rooms to people at reasonable rates. You're an honest sort, so you list your room prices right there on your site. But the scumbags you're competing with want to rip people off, so they list a lower price than yours, and then whack the customer with junk fees at check-in that make their room more expensive than yours. What's more, the scumbags make so much money that they can bribe the handful of dominant travel sites (which are all owned by one of two massive private-equity backed rollups) to list their hotels ahead of yours. They might not like paying bribes &#8211; in fact, they probably hate it &#8211; but they're willing to part with some of that hard-won ripoff money to keep the money-machine going. Besides, they can make up the difference with more junk fees. Whaddya gonna do, walk away from your nonrefundable, prepaid reservation and try and get a last-minute booking in a strange city? Societally speaking, the problem is that economic growth only comes from the third group. They're the ones inventing new categories of (useful) products and services that delight their customers and enrich their workers and shareholders (who then buy more things in the economy, keeping the virtuous cycle going). This festering economic zit is finally coming to a head with AI, whose most profitable use is in predicting how much a vendor can charge you &#8211; or how little a boss can pay you &#8211; without you walking away from the table: https://www.reddit.com/r/shitrentals/comments/1q38sh4/if_you_get_promoted_at_work_keep_it_a_secret_from/ AI's most enthusiastic customers, meanwhile, are bosses who dream of firing most of their workers and using the ensuing terror to force down the wages of the remaining workers: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism If the average American is a squeezed-flat toothpaste tube that's been drained of all its readily extractable contents, then AI is the scissors that slit the tube up the side so that the very last dregs can be scraped out. As Anil Dash put it, Those niceties that everybody loved, like great healthcare and decent benefits, were identified by the people running the big tech companies as “market inefficiencies” which indicated some wealth was going to you that should have been going to them. https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/06/500k-tech-workers-laid-off/ The scammer/arm-breaker economy is fundamentally extractive. When a private equity fund buys a company, sells off its assets, declares a special dividend and gives the proceeds to itself, and pronounces the company to have been "right-sized" because now it has to rent the things it used to own, they are setting that company up to fail. All it takes is one rent-shock or a couple bad quarters and a once-healthy business will fall over: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/23/spineless/#invertebrates Looking at America, it's hard not to ask, "Where did all the money go?" Where did free state college tuition, excellent public libraries, public housing, transit, fully staffed national parks and air-traffic control towers all go? Why can't we fix the potholes? How is it that a country that once electrified itself from top to bottom and sea to sea can't figure out how to run fiber lines to the same roofs where all those power lines connect? It's because the system is organized around cheaters and arm-breakers. The Heritage Foundation &#8211; architects of Trump's Project 2025 &#8211; were founded and funded by Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos, the guys who made their billions running Amway, a pyramid scheme that was legalized by their pet Congressman, Gerry Ford, shortly after he became president: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway The nation's system has been colonized and is being operated by people whose institutional home was created by pyramid-scheme hucksters. Why doesn't Trump's administration care about scam ads on Twitter and Facebook that clean out the very same Boomers who voted him into office? Because Trump's ideological project was founded by actual, non-metaphorical, non-hyperbolic con artists. That's where the money went. Smart people keep asking how Trump plans on stealing Venezuela's oil when the country is in a state of shambolic collapse and its people are starving? Who will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in new equipment when every dollar spent on capital will require a dollar for a gunman to keep it from being stolen and sold for food? You could ask the same question about America. In a country where we've literally legalized bribery, who wants to invest in productive businesses? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9Ej0L6rGk America's crisis is the world's opportunity. A chaotic mess of cyberwarfare, trade war, and invasions means that America is no longer your ally or your trading partner &#8211; it's a threat. To neutralize that threat, we must take away the money (and thus the power) of America's oligarchs. We start down that path by changing the international laws &#8211; passed at the insistence of the US over the past 25 years &#8211; that ban foreign tech companies from modifying America's tech products. Once other countries' companies start producing the tools that let farmers fix their tractors, that let games publishers sell outside of the official ripoff app stores, that let merchants avoid the Amazon tax, they will not only reap billions of dollars, they will also create a market that favors good products, rather than scams: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition America's largest companies have amassed trillions by robbing Americans (first) and then everyone else (once the US trade rep got laws passed that prevented non-US tech companies from making defensive products). The project of the next ten years is to convert those trillions to billions (in profits for companies that disenshittify America's defective technology &#8211; and in savings for people who use those tools to escape America's scam economy). The beneficiaries of this program aren't limited to the investors in foreign tech companies, nor their overseas customers. Americans will also benefit from this technology, because Americans were the first victims of the US scam economy. Everyday Americans pay the app tax, the Amazon tax, the streaming tax, the Apple tax, the Google tax, the Microsoft tax. Supply Americans with the digital arms to resist these corporate raids, and they will stage a tax revolt (a thing that Americans are remarkably good at). Escaping oligarchy, escaping the climate emergency, escaping economic desperation: these goals require doing things and making things. They require real products and services, they require real infrastructure and tools. By and large people would rather have real things than scams. Ponzi America is breaking down. It's run out of suckers. We just can't afford to structure our economy like an Amway downline anymore. We never could.

But the lenders didn&#39;t care, because they were only &#34;loan originators&#34; who could pass those loans off to &#34;investors&#34; via exotic financial instruments. These two groups had an irreconcilable conflict: the people making the loans could only keep their scam going so long as the people collecting the loans didn&#39;t demand repayment. But these two groups – scammers and arm-breakers – aren&#39;t the only two groups in the economy. There&#39;s a third group that you might call, &#34;People who want to make useful things that we like and pay for.&#34; This third group is at odds with both the scammers and the arm-breakers, because their potential customers are being tricked (by scammers) and bankrupted (by arm-breakers). Say you want to go into business renting hotel rooms to people at reasonable rates. You&#39;re an honest sort, so you list your room prices right there on your site. But the scumbags you&#39;re competing with want to rip people off, so they list a lower price than yours, and then whack the customer with junk fees at check-in that make their room more expensive than yours. What&#39;s more, the scumbags make so much money that they can bribe the handful of dominant travel sites (which are all owned by one of two massive private-equity backed rollups) to list their hotels ahead of yours. They might not like paying bribes – in fact, they probably hate it – but they&#39;re willing to part with some of that hard-won ripoff money to keep the money-machine going. Besides, they can make up the difference with more junk fees. Whaddya gonna do, walk away from your nonrefundable, prepaid reservation and try and get a last-minute booking in a strange city? Societally speaking, the problem is that economic growth only comes from the third group. They&#39;re the ones inventing new categories of (useful) products and services that delight their customers and enrich their workers and shareholders (who then buy more things in the economy, keeping the virtuous cycle going). This festering economic zit is finally coming to a head with AI, whose most profitable use is in predicting how much a vendor can charge you – or how little a boss can pay you – without you walking away from the table: https://www.reddit.com/r/shitrentals/comments/1q38sh4/if\_you\_get\_promoted\_at\_work\_keep\_it\_a\_secret\_from/ AI&#39;s most enthusiastic customers, meanwhile, are bosses who dream of firing most of their workers and using the ensuing terror to force down the wages of the remaining workers: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism If the average American is a squeezed-flat toothpaste tube that&#39;s been drained of all its readily extractable contents, then AI is the scissors that slit the tube up the side so that the very last dregs can be scraped out. As Anil Dash put it, Those niceties that everybody loved, like great healthcare and decent benefits, were identified by the people running the big tech companies as “market inefficiencies” which indicated some wealth was going to you that should have been going to them. https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/06/500k-tech-workers-laid-off/ The scammer/arm-breaker economy is fundamentally extractive. When a private equity fund buys a company, sells off its assets, declares a special dividend and gives the proceeds to itself, and pronounces the company to have been &#34;right-sized&#34; because now it has to rent the things it used to own, they are setting that company up to fail. All it takes is one rent-shock or a couple bad quarters and a once-healthy business will fall over: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/23/spineless/#invertebrates Looking at America, it&#39;s hard not to ask, &#34;Where did all the money go?&#34; Where did free state college tuition, excellent public libraries, public housing, transit, fully staffed national parks and air-traffic control towers all go? Why can&#39;t we fix the potholes? How is it that a country that once electrified itself from top to bottom and sea to sea can&#39;t figure out how to run fiber lines to the same roofs where all those power lines connect? It&#39;s because the system is organized around cheaters and arm-breakers. The Heritage Foundation – architects of Trump&#39;s Project 2025 – were founded and funded by Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos, the guys who made their billions running Amway, a pyramid scheme that was legalized by their pet Congressman, Gerry Ford, shortly after he became president: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway The nation&#39;s system has been colonized and is being operated by people whose institutional home was created by pyramid-scheme hucksters. Why doesn&#39;t Trump&#39;s administration care about scam ads on Twitter and Facebook that clean out the very same Boomers who voted him into office? Because Trump&#39;s ideological project was founded by actual, non-metaphorical, non-hyperbolic con artists. That&#39;s where the money went. Smart people keep asking how Trump plans on stealing Venezuela&#39;s oil when the country is in a state of shambolic collapse and its people are starving? Who will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in new equipment when every dollar spent on capital will require a dollar for a gunman to keep it from being stolen and sold for food? You could ask the same question about America. In a country where we&#39;ve literally legalized bribery, who wants to invest in productive businesses? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9Ej0L6rGk America&#39;s crisis is the world&#39;s opportunity. A chaotic mess of cyberwarfare, trade war, and invasions means that America is no longer your ally or your trading partner – it&#39;s a threat. To neutralize that threat, we must take away the money (and thus the power) of America&#39;s oligarchs. We start down that path by changing the international laws – passed at the insistence of the US over the past 25 years – that ban foreign tech companies from modifying America&#39;s tech products. Once other countries&#39; companies start producing the tools that let farmers fix their tractors, that let games publishers sell outside of the official ripoff app stores, that let merchants avoid the Amazon tax, they will not only reap billions of dollars, they will also create a market that favors good products, rather than scams: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition America&#39;s largest companies have amassed trillions by robbing Americans (first) and then everyone else (once the US trade rep got laws passed that prevented non-US tech companies from making defensive products). The project of the next ten years is to convert those trillions to billions (in profits for companies that disenshittify America&#39;s defective technology – and in savings for people who use those tools to escape America&#39;s scam economy). The beneficiaries of this program aren&#39;t limited to the investors in foreign tech companies, nor their overseas customers. Americans will also benefit from this technology, because Americans were the first victims of the US scam economy. Everyday Americans pay the app tax, the Amazon tax, the streaming tax, the Apple tax, the Google tax, the Microsoft tax. Supply Americans with the digital arms to resist these corporate raids, and they will stage a tax revolt (a thing that Americans are remarkably good at). Escaping oligarchy, escaping the climate emergency, escaping economic desperation: these goals require doing things and making things. They require real products and services, they require real infrastructure and tools. By and large people would rather have real things than scams. Ponzi America is breaking down. It&#39;s run out of suckers. We just can&#39;t afford to structure our economy like an Amway downline anymore. We never could.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2026-01-02-xobaque-does-rfc-5005">2026-01-02 Xobaque does RFC 5005</h1>
        
        <p>Very few blogs (this one?) support <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5005.html">RFC 5005</a> &ldquo;Feed Paging and Archiving&rdquo;.
        <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a> is a search engine that doesn&rsquo;t crawl the web. It gets fed using feeds. That makes it the ideal companion for web rings, blog planets and the like. And I just added blog crawling using RFC 5005 to it.</p>
        
        <p>As long as Xobaque finds a &ldquo;next&rdquo; link, it&rsquo;ll continue following that chain. In order to not overwhelm sites, there&rsquo;s a 5s pause between these requests. I&rsquo;m still not sure how good this idea is. A site like my own with a bit more than 6000 blog pages takes over 50 hours to crawl. And a new crawl is started every 24 hours.</p>
        
        <p>In my particular case, the next run that reaches a year-page, however, would notice that it hasn&rsquo;t changed and stop. So I hope it&rsquo;s still OK?</p>
        
        <p>I think the next thing I&rsquo;d like to do is support sitemaps. I don&rsquo;t have one but all the Blogspot blogs have one. There are 277 Blogspot blogs on the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg">RPG Planet</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The problem with sitemaps, as far as I am concerned, is that you then need to request each and every page. It&rsquo;s not quite random crawling, but it&rsquo;s getting closer. 😭</p>
        
        <p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Xobaque">#Xobaque</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Feeds">#Feeds</a></p>
        
        <p><strong>2026-01-03</strong>. There are four blogs on <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg">Planet RPG</a> which don&rsquo;t allow Xobaque using <code>robots.txt</code>. I wonder if <a href="Jupiter">Planet Jupiter</a> &ndash; the software I use to aggregate all the feeeds &ndash; takes <code>robots.txt</code> into account? I wrote it so long ago I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
        
        <p>As for the timeouts I&rsquo;ve been getting for Blogspot blogs and others, I think the problem is that their ASN is blocked as per my <a href="Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian Jihad</a>. The <code>fail2ban</code> firewall chain needs an exception.</p>
        
        <p>List the handles:</p>
        
        <pre><code>nft -a list chain inet f2b-table f2b-chain
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Insert the new rule between accept list and <code>fail2ban</code> list:</p>
        
        <pre><code>nft insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain handle 110 \
          ct state established,related accept \
          comment &quot;accept responses to outgoing traffic&quot;
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Result:</p>
        
        <pre><code>table inet f2b-table {
        	chain f2b-chain { # handle 1

        	}
        }
        </code></pre>
        
        <p><strong>2026-01-04</strong>. I implemented the import of sitemaps and sitemap indexes.
        Since those requests will all hit the same host, however, I&rsquo;m using a hard coded delay of 5s between requests.</p>
        
        <p>What I need to consider:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Get the crawl delay from <code>robots.txt</code>. Sadly, I just discovered that this was an extension that isn&rsquo;t supported by Google, for example.</li>
        <li>How to schedule the full crawl of an OPML such that the individual feed pages are fetched with the least amount of waiting while still upholding the crawl delay per host.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>2026-01-07</strong>. I&rsquo;ve been working on better parallelizing things. The current code assumes that there won&rsquo;t be all that many locations on the command line (!) and therefore starts a go routine for every OPML file to assemble a list of feeds and in a second step it then starts ten worker go routines that keep working on this task list. If full feeds are being fetched, finding a next page doesn&rsquo;t delay that go routine anymore. Instead, it starts a new go routine that delays and then adds the new URL to the task list, thus assuring that the delay is kept. And now, as I think about it, I guess that won&rsquo;t work because at the beginning, when the number of URLs is known, the task channel is stuffed with all the URLs and then closed. Gaaah.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2026-01-08</strong>. I think I fixed it. You don&rsquo;t close the task channel and the workers use <code>select</code> to get tasks off the channel and if there are no more tasks, they quit. The important part is that the workers must find the &ldquo;next&rdquo; link <em>before</em> doing the work of parsing and storing the page so that when they&rsquo;re done, the next task is already waiting. In previous iterations I was doing that at the end, at which point control returns to the worker, who pulls from the task list … and apparently often enough the task hasn&rsquo;t arrived, yet. Changing the order of things fixed this issue.</p>
        
        <p>Oh, and just in case the workers all get to go before the job that assembles the tasks, add a tiny millisecond sleep before they get started. Parallel stuff is hard.</p>]]>

      <source:markdown># 2026-01-02 Xobaque does RFC 5005

Very few blogs (this one?) support [RFC 5005](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5005.html) “Feed Paging and Archiving”.
[Xobaque](Xobaque) is a search engine that doesn’t crawl the web. It gets fed using feeds. That makes it the ideal companion for web rings, blog planets and the like. And I just added blog crawling using RFC 5005 to it.

As long as Xobaque finds a “next” link, it’ll continue following that chain. In order to not overwhelm sites, there’s a 5s pause between these requests. I’m still not sure how good this idea is. A site like my own with a bit more than 6000 blog pages takes over 50 hours to crawl. And a new crawl is started every 24 hours.

In my particular case, the next run that reaches a year-page, however, would notice that it hasn’t changed and stop. So I hope it’s still OK?

I think the next thing I’d like to do is support sitemaps. I don’t have one but all the Blogspot blogs have one. There are 277 Blogspot blogs on the [RPG Planet](https://campaignwiki.org/rpg).

The problem with sitemaps, as far as I am concerned, is that you then need to request each and every page. It’s not quite random crawling, but it’s getting closer. 😭

[#Xobaque](/search/?q=%23Xobaque) [#Feeds](/search/?q=%23Feeds)

**2026-01-03**. There are four blogs on [Planet RPG](https://campaignwiki.org/rpg) which don’t allow Xobaque using `robots.txt`. I wonder if [Planet Jupiter](Jupiter) – the software I use to aggregate all the feeeds – takes `robots.txt` into account? I wrote it so long ago I don’t remember.

As for the timeouts I’ve been getting for Blogspot blogs and others, I think the problem is that their ASN is blocked as per my [Butlerian Jihad](Butlerian_Jihad). The `fail2ban` firewall chain needs an exception.

List the handles:

```
nft -a list chain inet f2b-table f2b-chain

```

Insert the new rule between accept list and `fail2ban` list:

```
nft insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain handle 110 \
  ct state established,related accept \
  comment &#34;accept responses to outgoing traffic&#34;

```

Result:

```
table inet f2b-table {
	chain f2b-chain { # handle 1
		type filter hook input priority filter - 1; policy accept;
		tcp dport 0-65535 ip6 saddr @gotosocial6 accept # handle 12

	}
}

```

**2026-01-04**. I implemented the import of sitemaps and sitemap indexes.
Since those requests will all hit the same host, however, I’m using a hard coded delay of 5s between requests.

What I need to consider:

- Get the crawl delay from `robots.txt`. Sadly, I just discovered that this was an extension that isn’t supported by Google, for example.
- How to schedule the full crawl of an OPML such that the individual feed pages are fetched with the least amount of waiting while still upholding the crawl delay per host.

**2026-01-07**. I’ve been working on better parallelizing things. The current code assumes that there won’t be all that many locations on the command line (!) and therefore starts a go routine for every OPML file to assemble a list of feeds and in a second step it then starts ten worker go routines that keep working on this task list. If full feeds are being fetched, finding a next page doesn’t delay that go routine anymore. Instead, it starts a new go routine that delays and then adds the new URL to the task list, thus assuring that the delay is kept. And now, as I think about it, I guess that won’t work because at the beginning, when the number of URLs is known, the task channel is stuffed with all the URLs and then closed. Gaaah.

**2026-01-08**. I think I fixed it. You don’t close the task channel and the workers use `select` to get tasks off the channel and if there are no more tasks, they quit. The important part is that the workers must find the “next” link _before_ doing the work of parsing and storing the page so that when they’re done, the next task is already waiting. In previous iterations I was doing that at the end, at which point control returns to the worker, who pulls from the task list … and apparently often enough the task hasn’t arrived, yet. Changing the order of things fixed this issue.

Oh, and just in case the workers all get to go before the job that assembles the tasks, add a tiny millisecond sleep before they get started. Parallel stuff is hard.</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[rv is a new declarative command-line package manager for the R programming language written in Rust. Being declarative, I've found it to be far-and-away better at dependency resolution than any of the other package managers on the market, and being a command line tool rather than a tool to be called from inside an interactive R session makes it work much more agreeably with standard development workflows. In short, I really can't see myself recommending that anyone use any other tool for managing R dependencies any more.]]>

      <source:markdown>Matthias Ott [shared a link](https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott/115854306864049265) to a post from Anthropic titled [“Disrupting the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign”](https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage), which I read because [I’m interested](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/ai-browsers-frontier-security/) in the messy intersection of AI and security.

I gotta say: I don’t know if I’ve ever read anything quite like this article.

At first, the article felt like a responsible disclosure — “Hey, we’re reaching an inflection point where AI models are being used effectively for security exploits. Look at this one.”

But then I read further and found statements like this:

&#62; \[In the attack\] Claude didn’t always work perfectly. It occasionally hallucinated \[…\] This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks.

Wait, so is that a feature or a bug? Is it a good thing that your tool hallucinated and proved a stumbling block? Or is this bug you hope to fix?

The more I read, the more difficult it became to discern whether this security incident was a helpful warning or a feature sell.

&#62; With the correct setup, threat actors can now use agentic AI systems for extended periods to do the work of entire teams of experienced hackers: analyzing target systems, producing exploit code, and scanning vast datasets of stolen information more efficiently than any human operator. Less experienced and resourced groups can now potentially perform large-scale attacks of this nature.

Shoot, this sounds like a product pitch! Don’t have the experience or resources to keep up with your competitors who are cyberattacking? We’ve got a tool for you!

Wait, so if you’re creating something that can cause so much havoc, why are you still making it? Oh good, they address this exact question:

&#62; This raises an important question: if AI models can be misused for cyberattacks at this scale, why continue to develop and release them? The answer is that the very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defense.

Ok, so the article _is_ a product pitch:

- We’ve reached a tipping point in security.
- Look at this recent case where our AI was exploited to do malicious things with little human intervention.
- No doubt this same thing will happen again.
- You better go get our AI to protect yourself.

But that’s my words. Here’s theirs:

&#62; A fundamental change has occurred in cybersecurity. We advise security teams to experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like Security Operations Center automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. We also advise developers to continue to invest in safeguards across their AI platforms, to prevent adversarial misuse. The techniques described above will doubtless be used by many more attackers—which makes industry threat sharing, improved detection methods, and stronger safety controls all the more critical.

It appears AI is simultaneously the problem _and_ the solution.

It’s a great business to be in, if you think about it. You sell a tool for security exploits and you sell the self-same tool for protection against said exploits. Everybody wins!

I can’t help but read this post and think of a mafia shakedown. You know, where the mafia implies threats to get people to pay for their protection — a service they created the need for in the first place. ”Nice system you got there, would be a shame if anyone hacked into it using AI.

I find it funny that the URL slug for the article is:

`/disrupting-AI-espionage`

That’s a missed opportunity. They could’ve named it:

`/causing-and-disrupting-AI-espionage`

      <title>Pluralistic: Writing vs AI (07 Jan 2026)</title>
      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/07/delicious-pizza/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links Writing vs AI: If you wouldn't ask an AI to eat a delicious pizza for you, why would you ask it to write a college essay? Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: WELL State of the World; A poem in 30m logfiles; Weapons of Math Destruction; The cost of keeping "13" a British secret; Congress v. "Little Green Men"; "Food and Climate Change Without the Hot Air" Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Writing vs AI (permalink) I come from a family of teachers &#8211; both parents taught all their lives and now oversee Ed.D candidates, brother owns a school &#8211; which has left me painfully aware of the fact that I am not a great teacher. I am, however, a good teacher. The difference is that a good teacher can teach students who want to learn, whereas a great teacher can inspire students to want to learn. I've spent most of my life teaching, here and there, and while I'm not great, I am getting better. Last year, I started a new teaching gig: I'm one of Cornell's AD White Visiting Professors, meaning that I visit Cornell (and its NYC campus, Cornell Tech) every year or two for six years and teach, lecture, meet, and run activities. When I was in Ithaca in September for my inaugural stint, I had a string of what can only be called "peak experiences," meeting with researchers, teachers, undergrads, grads and community members. I had so many conversations that will stick with me, and today I want to talk about one of them. It was a faculty discussion, and one of the people at the table had been involved in a research project to investigate students' attitudes to their education. The research concluded that students come to Cornell to learn &#8211; because they love knowledge and critical thinking &#8211; but they are so haunted by the financial consequences of failure (wasting tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars repeating a year or failing out altogether, and then entering the job market debt-burdened and degree-less) that they feel pressured not to take intellectual risks, and, at worst, to cheat. They care about learning, but they're afraid of bad grades, and so chasing grades triumphs over learning. At that same discussion, I met someone who taught Cornell's version of freshman comp, the "here's how to write at a college level" course that every university offers. I've actually guest-taught some of these, starting in 2005/6, when I had a Fulbright Chair at USC. Now, while I'm not a great teacher, I am a pretty good writing teacher. I was lucky enough to be mentored by Judith Merril (starting at the age of 9!), who taught me how to participate in a peer-based writing workshop: https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/13/better-to-have-loved/#neofuturians In high school, I met Harriet Wolff, a gifted writing teacher, whose writing workshop (which Judith Merril had actually founded, decades earlier) was so good that I spent seven years in my four-year high-school, mostly just to keep going to Harriet's workshop: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/30/merely-clever/#rip-harriet-wolff I graduated from the Clarion science fiction and fantasy workshop (where Judith Merril learned to workshop) in 1992, and then went on to teach Clarion and Clarion West on several occasions, as well as other workshops in the field, such as Viable Paradise (today, I volunteer for Clarion's board). I have taught and been taught, and I've learned a thing or two. Here's the thing about every successful writing workshop I've been in: they don't necessarily make writing enjoyable (indeed, they can be painful), but they make it profoundly satisfying. When you repeatedly sit down with the same writers, week after week, to think about what went wrong with their work, and how they can fix it, and to hear the same about your work, something changes in how you relate to your work. You come to understand how to transform big, inchoate ideas into structured narratives and arguments, sure &#8211; but you also learn to recognize when the structure that emerges teaches you something about those big, inchoate ideas that was there all along, but not visible to you. It's revelatory. It teaches you what you know. It lets you know what you know. It lets you know more than you know. It's alchemical. It creates new knowledge, and dispels superstition. It sharpens how you think. It sharpens how you talk. And obviously, it sharpens how you write. The freshmen comp students I've taught over the years were amazed (or, more honestly, incredulous) when I told them this, because for them, writing was a totally pointless exercise. Well, almost totally pointless. Writing had one point: to get a passing grade so that the student could advance to other subjects. I'm not surprised by this, nor do I think it's merely because some of us are born to write and others will never get the knack (I've taught too many writers to think that anyone can guess who will find meaning in writing). It's because we don't generally teach writing this way until the most senior levels &#8211; the last year or two of undergrad, or, more likely, grad school (and then only if that grad program is an MFA). Writing instruction at lower levels, particularly in US high schools, is organized around standardized assessment. Students are trained to turn out the world's worst literary form: the five-paragraph essay: https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3749 The five-paragraph essay is so rigid that any attempt to enliven it is actually punished during the grading process. One cannot deviate from the structure, on penalty of academic censure. It's got all the structural constraints of a sonnet, and all the poetry of a car crusher. The five-paragraph essay is so terrible that a large part of the job of a freshman comp teacher is to teach students to stop writing them. But even after this is done, much of the freshman comp curriculum is also formulaic (albeit with additional flexibility). That's unavoidable: freshman comp classes are typically massive, since so many of the incoming students have to take it. When you're assessing 100-2,000 students, you necessarily fall back on a formula. Which brings me back to that faculty discussion at Cornell, where we learned first that students want to learn, but are afraid of failure; and then heard from the freshman comp teacher, who told us that virtually all of their students cheated on their assignments, getting chatbots to shit out their papers. And that's what I've been thinking about since September. Because of course those students cheat on their writing assignments &#8211; they are being taught to hit mechanical marks with their writing, improving their sentence structure, spelling and punctuation. What they're not learning is how to use writing to order and hone their thoughts, or to improve their ability to express those thoughts. They're being asked to write like a chatbot &#8211; why wouldn't they use a chatbot? You can't teach students to write &#8211; not merely to create formally correct sentences, but to write &#8211; through formal, easily graded assignments. Teaching writing is a relational practice. It requires that students interact extensively with one another's work, and with one another's criticism. It requires structure, sure &#8211; but the structure is in how you proceed through the critiques and subsequent discussion &#8211; not in the work itself. This is the kind of thing you do in small seminars, not big lecture halls. It requires that each student produce a steady stream of work for critique &#8211; multiple pieces per term or semester &#8211; and that each student closely read and discuss every other student's every composition. It's an intense experience that pushes students to think critically about critical thought itself. It's hard work that requires close supervision and it only works in small groups. Now, common sense will tell you that this is an impractical way to run a freshman comp class that thousands of students have to take. Not every school can be Yale, whose Daily Themes writing course is the most expensive program to deliver with one instructor for every two students: https://admissions.yale.edu/bulldogs-blogs/logan/2020/03/01/daily-themes But think back to the two statements that started me down this line of thinking: 1) Most students want to learn, but are afraid of the financial ruin that academic failure will entail and so they play things very safe; and 2) Virtually all freshman comp students use AI to cheat on their assignments. By the time we put our students in writing programs that you can't cheat on, and where you wouldn't want to cheat, they've had years of being taught to write like an LLM, but with the insistence that they not use an LLM. No wonder they're cheating! If you wanted to train a graduating class to cheat rather than learn, this is how you'd do it. Teaching freshman comp as a grammar/sentence structure tutorial misses the point. Sure, student writing is going to be bad at first. It'll be incoherent. It'll be riddled with errors. Reading student work is, for the most part, no fun. But for students, reading other students' writing, and thinking about what's wrong with it and how to fix it is the most reliable way to improve their own work (the dirty secret of writing workshops is that other writers' analysis of your work is generally less useful to you than the critical skills you learn by trying to fix their work). The amazing thing about bad writing is that it's easy to improve. It's much easier than finding ways to improve the work of a fluid, experienced writer. A beginning writer who makes a lot of easily spotted mistakes is a beginning writer who's making a lot of easily fixed mistakes. That means that the other writers around the circle are capable of spotting those errors, even if they're just starting out themselves. It also means that the writer whose work is under discussion will be able to make huge improvements through simple changes. Beginning writers can get a lot of momentum going this way, deriving real satisfaction from constant, visible progress. Replacing freshman comp with dozens of small groups run like graduate seminars is expensive and hard to imagine. But it would create a generation of students who wouldn't use an AI to write their essays any more than they'd ask an AI to eat a delicious pizza for them. We should aspire to assign the kinds of essays that change the lives of the students who write them, and to teach students to write that kind of essay. Freshman comp was always a machine for turning out reliable sentence-makers, not an atelier that trained reliable sense-makers. But AI changes the dynamic.

Colophon: All the rest. Writing vs AI (permalink) I come from a family of teachers – both parents taught all their lives and now oversee Ed.D candidates, brother owns a school – which has left me painfully aware of the fact that I am not a great teacher. I am, however, a good teacher. The difference is that a good teacher can teach students who want to learn, whereas a great teacher can inspire students to want to learn. I&#39;ve spent most of my life teaching, here and there, and while I&#39;m not great, I am getting better. Last year, I started a new teaching gig: I&#39;m one of Cornell&#39;s AD White Visiting Professors, meaning that I visit Cornell (and its NYC campus, Cornell Tech) every year or two for six years and teach, lecture, meet, and run activities. When I was in Ithaca in September for my inaugural stint, I had a string of what can only be called &#34;peak experiences,&#34; meeting with researchers, teachers, undergrads, grads and community members. I had so many conversations that will stick with me, and today I want to talk about one of them. It was a faculty discussion, and one of the people at the table had been involved in a research project to investigate students&#39; attitudes to their education. The research concluded that students come to Cornell to learn – because they love knowledge and critical thinking – but they are so haunted by the financial consequences of failure (wasting tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars repeating a year or failing out altogether, and then entering the job market debt-burdened and degree-less) that they feel pressured not to take intellectual risks, and, at worst, to cheat. They care about learning, but they&#39;re afraid of bad grades, and so chasing grades triumphs over learning. At that same discussion, I met someone who taught Cornell&#39;s version of freshman comp, the &#34;here&#39;s how to write at a college level&#34; course that every university offers. I&#39;ve actually guest-taught some of these, starting in 2005/6, when I had a Fulbright Chair at USC. Now, while I&#39;m not a great teacher, I am a pretty good writing teacher. I was lucky enough to be mentored by Judith Merril (starting at the age of 9!), who taught me how to participate in a peer-based writing workshop: https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/13/better-to-have-loved/#neofuturians In high school, I met Harriet Wolff, a gifted writing teacher, whose writing workshop (which Judith Merril had actually founded, decades earlier) was so good that I spent seven years in my four-year high-school, mostly just to keep going to Harriet&#39;s workshop: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/30/merely-clever/#rip-harriet-wolff I graduated from the Clarion science fiction and fantasy workshop (where Judith Merril learned to workshop) in 1992, and then went on to teach Clarion and Clarion West on several occasions, as well as other workshops in the field, such as Viable Paradise (today, I volunteer for Clarion&#39;s board). I have taught and been taught, and I&#39;ve learned a thing or two. Here&#39;s the thing about every successful writing workshop I&#39;ve been in: they don&#39;t necessarily make writing enjoyable (indeed, they can be painful), but they make it profoundly satisfying. When you repeatedly sit down with the same writers, week after week, to think about what went wrong with their work, and how they can fix it, and to hear the same about your work, something changes in how you relate to your work. You come to understand how to transform big, inchoate ideas into structured narratives and arguments, sure – but you also learn to recognize when the structure that emerges teaches you something about those big, inchoate ideas that was there all along, but not visible to you. It&#39;s revelatory. It teaches you what you know. It lets you know what you know. It lets you know more than you know. It&#39;s alchemical. It creates new knowledge, and dispels superstition. It sharpens how you think. It sharpens how you talk. And obviously, it sharpens how you write. The freshmen comp students I&#39;ve taught over the years were amazed (or, more honestly, incredulous) when I told them this, because for them, writing was a totally pointless exercise. Well, almost totally pointless. Writing had one point: to get a passing grade so that the student could advance to other subjects. I&#39;m not surprised by this, nor do I think it&#39;s merely because some of us are born to write and others will never get the knack (I&#39;ve taught too many writers to think that anyone can guess who will find meaning in writing). It&#39;s because we don&#39;t generally teach writing this way until the most senior levels – the last year or two of undergrad, or, more likely, grad school (and then only if that grad program is an MFA). Writing instruction at lower levels, particularly in US high schools, is organized around standardized assessment. Students are trained to turn out the world&#39;s worst literary form: the five-paragraph essay: https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3749 The five-paragraph essay is so rigid that any attempt to enliven it is actually punished during the grading process. One cannot deviate from the structure, on penalty of academic censure. It&#39;s got all the structural constraints of a sonnet, and all the poetry of a car crusher. The five-paragraph essay is so terrible that a large part of the job of a freshman comp teacher is to teach students to stop writing them. But even after this is done, much of the freshman comp curriculum is also formulaic (albeit with additional flexibility). That&#39;s unavoidable: freshman comp classes are typically massive, since so many of the incoming students have to take it. When you&#39;re assessing 100-2,000 students, you necessarily fall back on a formula. Which brings me back to that faculty discussion at Cornell, where we learned first that students want to learn, but are afraid of failure; and then heard from the freshman comp teacher, who told us that virtually all of their students cheated on their assignments, getting chatbots to shit out their papers. And that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking about since September. Because of course those students cheat on their writing assignments – they are being taught to hit mechanical marks with their writing, improving their sentence structure, spelling and punctuation. What they&#39;re not learning is how to use writing to order and hone their thoughts, or to improve their ability to express those thoughts. They&#39;re being asked to write like a chatbot – why wouldn&#39;t they use a chatbot? You can&#39;t teach students to write – not merely to create formally correct sentences, but to write – through formal, easily graded assignments. Teaching writing is a relational practice. It requires that students interact extensively with one another&#39;s work, and with one another&#39;s criticism. It requires structure, sure – but the structure is in how you proceed through the critiques and subsequent discussion – not in the work itself. This is the kind of thing you do in small seminars, not big lecture halls. It requires that each student produce a steady stream of work for critique – multiple pieces per term or semester – and that each student closely read and discuss every other student&#39;s every composition. It&#39;s an intense experience that pushes students to think critically about critical thought itself. It&#39;s hard work that requires close supervision and it only works in small groups. Now, common sense will tell you that this is an impractical way to run a freshman comp class that thousands of students have to take. Not every school can be Yale, whose Daily Themes writing course is the most expensive program to deliver with one instructor for every two students: https://admissions.yale.edu/bulldogs-blogs/logan/2020/03/01/daily-themes But think back to the two statements that started me down this line of thinking: 1) Most students want to learn, but are afraid of the financial ruin that academic failure will entail and so they play things very safe; and 2) Virtually all freshman comp students use AI to cheat on their assignments. By the time we put our students in writing programs that you can&#39;t cheat on, and where you wouldn&#39;t want to cheat, they&#39;ve had years of being taught to write like an LLM, but with the insistence that they not use an LLM. No wonder they&#39;re cheating! If you wanted to train a graduating class to cheat rather than learn, this is how you&#39;d do it. Teaching freshman comp as a grammar/sentence structure tutorial misses the point. Sure, student writing is going to be bad at first. It&#39;ll be incoherent. It&#39;ll be riddled with errors. Reading student work is, for the most part, no fun. But for students, reading other students&#39; writing, and thinking about what&#39;s wrong with it and how to fix it is the most reliable way to improve their own work (the dirty secret of writing workshops is that other writers&#39; analysis of your work is generally less useful to you than the critical skills you learn by trying to fix their work). The amazing thing about bad writing is that it&#39;s easy to improve. It&#39;s much easier than finding ways to improve the work of a fluid, experienced writer. A beginning writer who makes a lot of easily spotted mistakes is a beginning writer who&#39;s making a lot of easily fixed mistakes. That means that the other writers around the circle are capable of spotting those errors, even if they&#39;re just starting out themselves. It also means that the writer whose work is under discussion will be able to make huge improvements through simple changes. Beginning writers can get a lot of momentum going this way, deriving real satisfaction from constant, visible progress. Replacing freshman comp with dozens of small groups run like graduate seminars is expensive and hard to imagine. But it would create a generation of students who wouldn&#39;t use an AI to write their essays any more than they&#39;d ask an AI to eat a delicious pizza for them. We should aspire to assign the kinds of essays that change the lives of the students who write them, and to teach students to write that kind of essay. Freshman comp was always a machine for turning out reliable sentence-makers, not an atelier that trained reliable sense-makers. But AI changes the dynamic. Today, students are asking chatbots to write their essays for the same reason that corporations are asking chatbots to do their customer service (because they don&#39;t give a shit): https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/06/unmerchantable-substitute-goods/#customer-disservice I&#39;m not saying that small writing workshops of the sort that changed my life will work for everyone. But I am saying that teaching writing in huge lecture halls with assignments optimized for grading works for no one.

        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-12-23-a-problem-in-the-butlerian-jihad-setup">2025-12-23 A problem in the Butlerian Jihad setup</h1>
        
        <p>I think there&rsquo;s a problem with <a href="https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index">the setup</a> that defends my sites against the scraper-bots.
        I think I have ASNs banned but when I check the logs, requests are still getting through.
        As a result, Community Wiki is still down.</p>
        
        <p>Let&rsquo;s delve right in. If you&rsquo;re interested in scripts and shell aliases, see the <a href="/admin">admin folder</a>.</p>
        
        <p>These ASNs are my top hitters on Community Wiki right now:</p>
        
        <pre><code>10min-access-log \
          | awk '/^communitywiki/ {print $2}' \
          | asncounter --top 3 --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null
        count	percent	ASN	AS
        122	3.12	28573	Claro NXT Telecomunicacoes Ltda, BR
        84	2.15	45899	VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp, VN
        54	1.38	9541	CYBERNET-AP Cyber Internet Services Pvt Ltd., PK
        unique ASN: 1607
        total lookups: 3906
        total skipped: 0
        total failed: 0
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>And yet, the ASN seems to be banned!</p>
        
        <pre><code>asn-banned 28573
        28573 banned for 1h: 1
        28573 banned for 1w: 0
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Let&rsquo;s check:</p>
        
        <pre><code>10min-access-log | asn-access-log 28573 | tail -n 1
        communitywiki.org:443 187.23.18.103 - - [23/Dec/2025:09:05:17 +0100] &quot;GET /wiki?action=rc&amp;all=0&amp;days=7&amp;rcfilteronly=tag%3Aprojects&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 410 3928 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.131 Safari/537.36&quot; 379
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>This IP address doesn&rsquo;t seem to be banned after all!</p>
        
        <pre><code>fail2ban-client banned 187.23.18.103
        [[]]
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Nor is the range banned:</p>
        
        <pre><code>asn-find '187.23.18.103'
        187.23.0.0/19	28573	Claro NXT Telecomunicacoes Ltda, BR
        fail2ban-client banned 187.23.0.0/19
        [[]]
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>What is going on? It&rsquo;s definitely not banned:</p>
        
        <pre><code>fail2ban-client banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq | grep 187.23.0.0/19
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>No results. And that seems to be the problem. <code>asn-networks</code> doesn&rsquo;t list <code>187.23.0.0/19</code> as belonging to ASN 28573 even though looking up <code>187.23.18.103</code> says it belongs to ASN 28573!</p>
        
        <pre><code>asn-networks 28573 | grep  '^187\.23\.'
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>No results. So let&rsquo;s check whether this range is subsumed in some other range.</p>
        
        <pre><code>asn-networks 28573 | grep  '^187\.2'
        187.2.0.0/15
        187.20.0.0/14
        187.255.0.0/16
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Indeed!</p>
        
        <pre><code>cidr-to-ip-range 187.20.0.0/14
        187.20.0.0 - 187.23.255.255
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>So this IP range covers the IP number we&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
        
        <pre><code>fail2ban-client banned 187.20.0.0/14
        [['butlerian-jihad']]
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>OK! I&rsquo;m happy to see this.
        So now the question is, why are requests from <code>187.23.18.103</code> not dropped?</p>

        <p>No results. So it does seem like fail2ban is not working as I expected.</p>

        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I guess this is key: &ldquo;Error: You must add &lsquo;flags interval&rsquo; to your set declaration if you want to add prefix elements&rdquo;.</p>
        
        <p>I didn&rsquo;t know <code>fail2ban</code> was using <code>nft</code>. I must take a look at <code>/etc/fail2ban/action.d/nftables-multiport.conf</code>, I guess.</p>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at <a href="https://itsfoss.gitlab.io/blog/fail2ban-with-iptables-persistent/">Securing Your Server: Integrating Fail2ban with IPTables-Persistent for Enhanced Protection</a> and it makes me think I might use ipsets instead.
        I&rsquo;m hoping that won&rsquo;t be too hard since I already use <code>ipset</code> for my allowlists and my permanent banlists.
        See <a href="2025-07-11-allow-list">2025-07-11 A separate allow-list to bypass fail2ban</a>.</p>
        
        <p>When I do the switch, I must remember to flush the lists that <code>fail2ban</code> is currently using. If there are entries on the old list, they would stay there forever if the commands to add and remove entries got changed.</p>
        
        <p>I also learned that Debian installs tools that look like <code>iptables</code> but they&rsquo;re actually a compatibility layer that use <code>nft</code> instead.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;The iptables Debian package install both and gives the nft version more priority by default in the update-alternatives system. This means that if you install this package, you will be using the nft tools instead of the legacy ones.&rdquo; &ndash; <code>/usr/share/doc/iptables/README.Debian</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>🤯</p>
        
        <p>This is why <code>fail2ban</code> uses <code>iptables</code> but the error messages mention <code>nft</code>.</p>
        
        <p>So here is what I ended up doing.</p>
        
        <p>I switched from <code>iptables</code> to <code>nft</code> by creating a new file <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local</code>:</p>
        
        <pre><code>[DEFAULT]
        banaction = nftables[type=multiport]
        banaction_allports = nftables[type=allports]
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I created a local override for the nftables action so that <code>flags interval</code> gets added to the sets, and to add my allow-lists.
        Here&rsquo;s <code>/etc/fail2ban/action.d/nftables.local</code>.</p>
        
        <pre><code># -*- mode: Conf -*-
        [Definition]
        # add &quot;flags interval;&quot;
        # add special allowlists
        _nft_add_set = &lt;nftables&gt; add set &lt;table_family&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;addr_set&gt; \{ type &lt;addr_type&gt;\; flags interval\; \}
                      &lt;_nft_for_proto-&lt;type&gt;-iter&gt;
                      &lt;nftables&gt; add rule &lt;table_family&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;chain&gt; %(rule_stat)s
                      &lt;_nft_for_proto-&lt;type&gt;-done&gt;
        	     /etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist
        	     /etc/butlerian-jihad/remove-extra-allowlist-rules
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>To confirm, you can list all tables and then list the <code>f2b-table</code>. It contains all the sets, one for each jail of yours. The important part is that it says <code>flags interval</code> in there.</p>
        
        <pre><code>nft list sets inet f2b-table
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Note that if you check the <code>fail2ban</code> log, you&rsquo;ll still find errors such as &ldquo;interval overlaps with an existing one&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s OK, though. No double-banning, I guess. 😅</p>
        
        <p>But wait, what about <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist</code>? This is where I add my manual allow-list. Like <code>wilderland.ovh</code>, the other IRC server in our little network:</p>
        
        <pre><code>#!/usr/sbin/nft -f
        
        # define the sets
        add set inet f2b-table allowlist   { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
        add set inet f2b-table allowlist6  { type ipv6_addr; flags interval; }
        add set inet f2b-table gotosocial  { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
        add set inet f2b-table gotosocial6 { type ipv6_addr; flags interval; }
        
        # insert rules at the beginning

        <p>Notice the rule <code>ct state established,related accept</code>.
        That&rsquo;s so I can still make requests for websites on hosts that are bannned.</p>
        
        <p>And what about that <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft</code> file?
        That&rsquo;s generated every now and then from the local database so that all the IP numbers of instances where I follow someone or where someone follows me are on the allow list.
        I generate it using a script called <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare</code>
        This script is a <code>bash</code> script instead of a <code>fish</code> script because <code>fish</code> requires a directory where it writes its history.
        I found out when I had a gazillion protections in place.
        But then I could not get the script to access the database so I removed all the protections.
        And now I feel silly because the script is still written in <code>bash</code> but I prefer <code>fish</code>.</p>

        <p>The command here saves a copy in <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft</code>.
        This copy is important because it&rsquo;s the script called when <code>fail2ban</code> starts up and calls <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist</code> which includes it.
        The service also pipes the output straight to <code>nft</code> to execute it.</p>

        <p>Enable and start it:</p>
        
        <pre><code>systemctl enable --now ./gotosocial-prepare.timer
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Check it:</p>
        
        <pre><code>systemctl status gotosocial-prepare.timer
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>And now the allow-list should refresh every month. 😍</p>
        
        <p>A note on why the allow lists cannot be in a separate table.
        The key is this little info in the documentation, as I had to find out:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;If a packet is accepted and there is another chain, bearing the same hook type and with a later priority, then the packet will subsequently traverse this other chain. Hence, an accept verdict – be it by way of a rule or the default chain policy – isn&rsquo;t necessarily final.&rdquo;</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>So if the allow-list is in an earlier chain and is accepted, the later <code>fail2ban</code> chain can still drop the packets. Conversely, if the <code>fail2ban</code> chain comes first, the packets dropped are no longer available in later chains so the decision cannot be reversed.
        The sets with the addresses have to be in the <code>f2b-table</code> and the rules using them have to be in the <code>f2b-chain</code>.</p>
        
        <p>You might be wondering: Why is nobody else running into all this? The answer, I think, is that I started out banning whole ASNs, that is, all their IP address ranges. So now <code>fail2ban</code> manages address ranges instead of individual addresses and I can no longer use <code>fail2ban</code>’s <code>ignoreip</code> command which is probably what everybody else is using. But I want to ban the address ranges and allow individual addresses within those ranges.</p>
        
        <p>Note that multiple restarts keep adding rules the the chain.
        Therefore, another script runs after <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist</code>.
        It removes the duplicates, if any.</p>
        
        <p>Here&rsquo;s <code>/etc/butlerian-jihad/remove-extra-allowlist-rules</code>:</p>
        
        <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/bash
        for set in allowlist allowlist6 gotosocial gotosocial6; do

      <source:markdown># 2025-12-23 A problem in the Butlerian Jihad setup

I think there’s a problem with [the setup](https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index) that defends my sites against the scraper-bots.
I think I have ASNs banned but when I check the logs, requests are still getting through.
As a result, Community Wiki is still down.

Let’s delve right in. If you’re interested in scripts and shell aliases, see the [admin folder](/admin).

These ASNs are my top hitters on Community Wiki right now:

```
10min-access-log \
  | awk &#39;/^communitywiki/ {print $2}&#39; \
  | asncounter --top 3 --no-prefixes 2&#62;/dev/null
count	percent	ASN	AS
122	3.12	28573	Claro NXT Telecomunicacoes Ltda, BR
84	2.15	45899	VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp, VN
54	1.38	9541	CYBERNET-AP Cyber Internet Services Pvt Ltd., PK
unique ASN: 1607
total lookups: 3906
total skipped: 0
total failed: 0

```

And yet, the ASN seems to be banned!

```
asn-banned 28573
28573 banned for 1h: 1
28573 banned for 1w: 0

```

Let’s check:

```
10min-access-log | asn-access-log 28573 | tail -n 1
communitywiki.org:443 187.23.18.103 - - [23/Dec/2025:09:05:17 +0100] &#34;GET /wiki?action=rc&#38;all=0&#38;days=7&#38;rcfilteronly=tag%3Aprojects&#38;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&#34; 410 3928 &#34;-&#34; &#34;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.131 Safari/537.36&#34; 379

```

This IP address doesn’t seem to be banned after all!

```
fail2ban-client banned 187.23.18.103
[[]]

```

Nor is the range banned:

```
asn-find &#39;187.23.18.103&#39;
187.23.0.0/19	28573	Claro NXT Telecomunicacoes Ltda, BR
fail2ban-client banned 187.23.0.0/19
[[]]

```

What is going on? It’s definitely not banned:

```
fail2ban-client banned | sed &#39;s/\&#39;/&#34;/g&#39; | jq | grep 187.23.0.0/19

```

No results. And that seems to be the problem. `asn-networks` doesn’t list `187.23.0.0/19` as belonging to ASN 28573 even though looking up `187.23.18.103` says it belongs to ASN 28573!

```
asn-networks 28573 | grep  &#39;^187\.23\.&#39;

```

No results. So let’s check whether this range is subsumed in some other range.

```
asn-networks 28573 | grep  &#39;^187\.2&#39;
187.2.0.0/15
187.20.0.0/14
187.255.0.0/16

```

Indeed!

```
cidr-to-ip-range 187.20.0.0/14
187.20.0.0 - 187.23.255.255

```

So this IP range covers the IP number we’re interested in.

```
fail2ban-client banned 187.20.0.0/14
[[&#39;butlerian-jihad&#39;]]

```

OK! I’m happy to see this.
So now the question is, why are requests from `187.23.18.103` not dropped?

```
iptables --list

Chain f2b-recidive (1 references)
target     prot opt source               destination

```

Is the IP number on the `gotosocial` or `allowlist`?

```
ipset test allowlist 187.23.18.103
187.23.18.103 is NOT in set allowlist.
ipset test gotosocial 187.23.18.103
187.23.18.103 is NOT in set gotosocial.

```

No results. So it does seem like fail2ban is not working as I expected.

Looking for errors in the `fail2ban` log file, I find a lot of entries like this one:

```

So `fail2ban` manages to record the fact, that `187.20.0.0/14` is banned, and unbans it correctly, but the actual ban itself runs into an error!

Looking around some more, I see this:

```

```

I guess this is key: “Error: You must add ‘flags interval’ to your set declaration if you want to add prefix elements”.

I didn’t know `fail2ban` was using `nft`. I must take a look at `/etc/fail2ban/action.d/nftables-multiport.conf`, I guess.

I’ve been looking at [Securing Your Server: Integrating Fail2ban with IPTables-Persistent for Enhanced Protection](https://itsfoss.gitlab.io/blog/fail2ban-with-iptables-persistent/) and it makes me think I might use ipsets instead.
I’m hoping that won’t be too hard since I already use `ipset` for my allowlists and my permanent banlists.
See [2025-07-11 A separate allow-list to bypass fail2ban](2025-07-11-allow-list).

When I do the switch, I must remember to flush the lists that `fail2ban` is currently using. If there are entries on the old list, they would stay there forever if the commands to add and remove entries got changed.

I also learned that Debian installs tools that look like `iptables` but they’re actually a compatibility layer that use `nft` instead.

&#62; “The iptables Debian package install both and gives the nft version more priority by default in the update-alternatives system. This means that if you install this package, you will be using the nft tools instead of the legacy ones.” – `/usr/share/doc/iptables/README.Debian`

🤯

This is why `fail2ban` uses `iptables` but the error messages mention `nft`.

So here is what I ended up doing.

I switched from `iptables` to `nft` by creating a new file `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`:

```
[DEFAULT]
banaction = nftables[type=multiport]
banaction_allports = nftables[type=allports]

```

I created a local override for the nftables action so that `flags interval` gets added to the sets, and to add my allow-lists.
Here’s `/etc/fail2ban/action.d/nftables.local`.

```
# -*- mode: Conf -*-
[Definition]
# add &#34;flags interval;&#34;
# add special allowlists
_nft_add_set = &#60;nftables&#62; add set &#60;table_family&#62; &#60;table&#62; &#60;addr_set&#62; \{ type &#60;addr_type&#62;\; flags interval\; \}
              &#60;_nft_for_proto-&#60;type&#62;-iter&#62;
              &#60;nftables&#62; add rule &#60;table_family&#62; &#60;table&#62; &#60;chain&#62; %(rule_stat)s
              &#60;_nft_for_proto-&#60;type&#62;-done&#62;
	     /etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist
	     /etc/butlerian-jihad/remove-extra-allowlist-rules

```

To confirm, you can list all tables and then list the `f2b-table`. It contains all the sets, one for each jail of yours. The important part is that it says `flags interval` in there.

```
nft list sets inet f2b-table

```

Note that if you check the `fail2ban` log, you’ll still find errors such as “interval overlaps with an existing one”. That’s OK, though. No double-banning, I guess. 😅

But wait, what about `/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist`? This is where I add my manual allow-list. Like `wilderland.ovh`, the other IRC server in our little network:

```
#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

# define the sets
add set inet f2b-table allowlist   { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
add set inet f2b-table allowlist6  { type ipv6_addr; flags interval; }
add set inet f2b-table gotosocial  { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
add set inet f2b-table gotosocial6 { type ipv6_addr; flags interval; }

# insert rules at the beginning
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip  saddr @allowlist   accept
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip6 saddr @allowlist6  accept
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip  saddr @gotosocial  accept
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain tcp dport 0-65535 ip6 saddr @gotosocial6 accept
insert rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain ct state established,related accept comment &#34;accept responses to outgoing traffic&#34;

add element inet f2b-table allowlist {
  51.83.186.78 comment &#34;kyonshi and wilderland.ovh&#34;,
  # and a few more
}

add element inet f2b-table allowlist6 {
   2001:41d0:601:1100::12d comment &#34;kyonshi and wilderland.ovh&#34;,
  # and a few more
}

include &#34;/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft&#34;

```

Notice the rule `ct state established,related accept`.
That’s so I can still make requests for websites on hosts that are bannned.

And what about that `/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft` file?
That’s generated every now and then from the local database so that all the IP numbers of instances where I follow someone or where someone follows me are on the allow list.
I generate it using a script called `/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare`
This script is a `bash` script instead of a `fish` script because `fish` requires a directory where it writes its history.
I found out when I had a gazillion protections in place.
But then I could not get the script to access the database so I removed all the protections.
And now I feel silly because the script is still written in `bash` but I prefer `fish`.

```
#!/usr/bin/bash
# Redirect the output of this script into /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft
set -e
echo &#34;#!/usr/sbin/nft&#34;

    ipv4=$(host -t A &#34;$domain&#34; | awk &#39;/has address/ { print $4}&#39;)
    echo &#34;$i/$m $domain&#34; &#62;&#38;2
    for ip in $ipv6; do
        ipv6list+=(&#34;$ip comment \&#34;$domain\&#34;&#34;)
    done
    for ip in $ipv4; do
        ipv4list+=(&#34;$ip comment \&#34;$domain\&#34;&#34;)
    done
    i=$((i + 1))
done
echo &#34;add element inet f2b-table gotosocial {&#34;
for item in &#34;${ipv4list[@]}&#34;; do
    echo &#34;  $item,&#34;
done
echo &#34;}&#34;
echo
echo &#34;add element inet f2b-table gotosocial6 {&#34;
for item in &#34;${ipv6list[@]}&#34;; do
    echo &#34;  $item,&#34;
done
echo &#34;}&#34;

```

If you run it, it prints the results to `stdout` and the progress messages to `stderr`.

You can redirect it to a file:

```
./gotosocial-prepare &#62; gotosocial.nft

```

The content looks something like this:

```
#!/usr/sbin/nft

# 2025-12-25

flush set inet f2b-table gotosocial
flush set inet f2b-table gotosocial6

add element inet f2b-table gotosocial {
  78.47.204.93 comment &#34;berlin.social&#34;,
  # and many more
}

add element inet f2b-table gotosocial6 {
  2a01:4f8:c0c:3093::1 comment &#34;berlin.social&#34;,
  # and many more
}

```

And now for the `systemd` integration.

The unit file is `/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Update the allow-list for gotosocial

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=sh -c &#39;/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare | tee /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft | nft -f -&#39;

```

Enable it:

```
systemctl enable /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare.service

```

It complains that there is no way to run it since the timer is missing but we’re not ready, yet.

The command here saves a copy in `/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.nft`.
This copy is important because it’s the script called when `fail2ban` starts up and calls `/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist` which includes it.
The service also pipes the output straight to `nft` to execute it.

Test it:

```
systemctl start gotosocial-prepare-service

```

Assuming it works … we need a monthly timer, now.

The timer file is `/etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial-prepare.timer`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Update the allow-list for gotosocial

[Timer]
OnCalendar=1month
RandomizedDelaySec=600

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

```

Enable and start it:

```
systemctl enable --now ./gotosocial-prepare.timer

```

Check it:

```
systemctl status gotosocial-prepare.timer

```

And now the allow-list should refresh every month. 😍

A note on why the allow lists cannot be in a separate table.
The key is this little info in the documentation, as I had to find out:

&#62; “If a packet is accepted and there is another chain, bearing the same hook type and with a later priority, then the packet will subsequently traverse this other chain. Hence, an accept verdict – be it by way of a rule or the default chain policy – isn’t necessarily final.”

So if the allow-list is in an earlier chain and is accepted, the later `fail2ban` chain can still drop the packets. Conversely, if the `fail2ban` chain comes first, the packets dropped are no longer available in later chains so the decision cannot be reversed.
The sets with the addresses have to be in the `f2b-table` and the rules using them have to be in the `f2b-chain`.

You might be wondering: Why is nobody else running into all this? The answer, I think, is that I started out banning whole ASNs, that is, all their IP address ranges. So now `fail2ban` manages address ranges instead of individual addresses and I can no longer use `fail2ban`’s `ignoreip` command which is probably what everybody else is using. But I want to ban the address ranges and allow individual addresses within those ranges.

Note that multiple restarts keep adding rules the the chain.
Therefore, another script runs after `/etc/butlerian-jihad/add-allowlist`.
It removes the duplicates, if any.

Here’s `/etc/butlerian-jihad/remove-extra-allowlist-rules`:

```
#!/usr/bin/bash
for set in allowlist allowlist6 gotosocial gotosocial6; do
    nft -a list chain inet f2b-table f2b-chain \
	| awk &#39;/&#39;$set&#39; accept/ { print &#34;delete rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain handle &#34; $NF }&#39; \
	| head -n -1 \
	| nft -i
done

nft -a list chain inet f2b-table f2b-chain \
    | awk &#39;/ct state established,related/ { print &#34;delete rule inet f2b-table f2b-chain handle &#34; $NF }&#39; \
    | head -n -1 \
    | nft -i

```

[#Butlerian Jihad](/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad)

**2026-01-07**. I think instead of `host` I should be using `dig` for a whole bunch of lookups.

      <source:markdown>**[A field guide to sandboxes for AI](https://www.luiscardoso.dev/blog/sandboxes-for-ai)**

This guide to the current sandboxing landscape by Luis Cardoso is comprehensive, dense and absolutely fantastic.

He starts by differentiating between containers (which share the host kernel), microVMs (their own guest kernel behind hardwae virtualization), gVisor userspace kernels and WebAssembly/isolates that constrain everything within a runtime.

The piece then dives deep into terminology, approaches and the landscape of existing tools.

I think using the right sandboxes to safely run untrusted code is one of the most important problems to solve in 2026. This guide is an invaluable starting point.

        <p>For all the US citizens who are angry and disappointed about how they world is treating them only because they happen to be citizens of a country ruled by wanna-be dictators, all I have to offer is my impression of how the world treated Germans for decades after the second World War.

Yes, it was probably unfair to some. But what has haunted me ever since is this: How much resistance is required for you to be cleared of the stain of collective guilt? Not on the individual level, but on the collective level. Yes, some of my ancestors were Nazis, most likely. Or cowards. Or beneficiaries. It&rsquo;s the small fragments and rumours that remain. A great grandfather got wounded in Italy and deserted, walked all the way back to Lübeck and got nursed back to health in the cellar of his Grand Hotel. The neighbours felt that the Nazi got what he deserved. One grandfather apparently cheered the Anschluss on the Heldenplatz in Vienna. Does cheering for the wrong party make you as guilty as the concentration camp guard? No. Are all descendants absolved of their ancestor&rsquo;s sins? Also no. The responsibility remains. To keep the memory alive. To hear the accusations and to acknowledge what happened. To right the wrongs. To give back what was taken. Some have always been part of the resistance. Some might be waking up to it just now. Some might say, like in that meme, with a smirk, &ldquo;first time around?&rdquo; Some will never understand and they need to be outvoted or outgunned. Collective responsibility is hard because most of us were taught that the children must not suffer for the sins of their ancestors.

(For future readers some historical context: The Trump administration has kidnapped Maduro from Venezuela much like the Bush administration kidnapped Noriega from Panama and now the Trump administration is once again threatening to take Greenland from Denmark.)

When we visited Amsterdam many years ago, I think the museum that I remember best is the [Resistance museum](https://www.verzetsmuseum.org/en/world-war-ii-in-the-netherlands). “The Dutch Resistance Museum tells the story of people in times of war. These people aren’t heroes and villains, but ordinary people forced to make choices in the face of scarcity and oppression.” It showed that when your country is taken over by dictators, there’s a big spectrum of responses possible.

And just now I discovered that last year the list of suspected Nazi collaborators in the Netherlands got released: [A list of half a million names shines new light on Dutch collaboration with Nazis](https://text.npr.org/2025/01/07/nx-s1-5249956/nazi-collaborators-netherlands-archive). A law had kept access restricted for eighty years. About 425,000 individuals were suspected of collaborating with Nazi Germany. Wikipedia says there were [9.2 million inhabitants](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data:Netherlands_Total_Population.tab) at the time, so nearly 5% of the population.

Here’s what I’m hoping for all of us: When the time comes, don’t be a fucking collaborator.

        Some posts are a lot of work, and take more than a week. Major talks, such as <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/09/the-gaslit-asset-class.html"><i>The Gaslit Asset Class</i></a> or <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/04/paul-evan-peters-award-lecture.html"><i>Lessons from LOCKSS</i></a> typically represent a month's work, as do long posts such as <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/12/sabotaging-bitcoin.html"><i>Sabotaging Biitcoin</i></a>, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/12/drones.html"><i>Drones</i></a> or <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/05/the-dawn-of-nvidias-technology.html"><i>The Dawn Of Nvidia's Technology</i></a>.<br />
        <br />
        The 1000 posts have gained over 6.88M page views, 7.6% of which were for my <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/ee380-talk.html"><i>EE380 Talk</i></a>. Less publicized but popular posts get around 30K page views, well above the 6.9K average.<br />
        <br />
        The only one of these statistics that I care about is the goal of a post a week. Having an audience is nice when it happens, but that's not why I'm writing. I write for myself, to understand not necessarily to communicate. Despite this, I'd like to thank those who read and comment.<br />

      <title>Pluralistic: Code is a liability (not an asset) (06 Jan 2026)</title>
      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/06/1000x-liability/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links Code is a liability (not an asset): AI psychosis, tech boss edition. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Coldplay CD DRM; Star Wars Wars; Digital manorialism vs neofeudalism; Transvaginal foetal sonic bombardment: woo-tunes for your hoo-hah. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Code is a liability (not an asset) (permalink) Code is a liability (not an asset). Tech bosses don't understand this. They think AI is great because it produces 10,000 times more code than a programmer, but that just means it's producing 10,000 times more liabilities. AI is the asbestos we're shoveling into the walls of our high-tech society: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence Code is a liability. Code's capabilities are assets. The goal of a tech shop is to have code whose capabilities generate more revenue than the costs associated with keeping that code running. For a long time, firms have nurtured a false belief that code costs less to run over time: after an initial shakedown period in which the bugs in the code are found and addressed, code ceases to need meaningful maintenance. After all, code is a machine without moving parts &#8211; it does not wear out; it doesn't even wear down. This is the thesis of Paul Mason's 2015 book Postcapitalism, a book that has aged remarkably poorly (though not, perhaps, as poorly as Mason's own political credibility): code is not an infinitely reproducible machine that requires no labor inputs to operate. Rather, it is a brittle machine that requires increasingly heroic measures to keep it in good working order, and which eventually does "wear out" (in the sense of needing a top-to-bottom refactoring). To understand why code is a liability, you have to understand the difference between "writing code" and "software engineering." "Writing code" is an incredibly useful, fun, and engrossing pastime. It involves breaking down complex tasks into discrete steps that are so precisely described that a computer can reliably perform them, and optimising that performance by finding clever ways of minimizing the demands the code puts on the computer's resources, such as RAM and processor cycles. Meanwhile, "software engineering" is a discipline that subsumes "writing code," but with a focus on the long-term operations of the system the code is part of. Software engineering concerns itself with the upstream processes that generate the data the system receives. It concerns itself with the downstream processes that the system emits processed information to. It concerns itself with the adjacent systems that are receiving data from the same upstream processes and/or emitting data to the same downstream processes the system is emitting to. "Writing code" is about making code that runs well. "Software engineering" is about making code that fails well. It's about making code that is legible &#8211; whose functions can be understood by third parties who might be asked to maintain it, or might be asked to adapt the processes downstream, upstream or adjacent to the system to keep the system from breaking. It's about making code that can be adapted, for example, when the underlying computer architecture it runs on is retired and has to be replaced, either with a new kind of computer, or with an emulated version of the old computer: https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/hpux_end_of_life/ Because that's the thing: any nontrivial code has to interact with the outside world, and the outside world isn't static, it's dynamic. The outside world busts through the assumptions made by software authors all the time and every time it does, the software needs to be fixed. Remember Y2K? That was a day when perfectly functional code, running on perfectly functional hardware, would stop functioning &#8211; not because the code changed, but because time marched on. We're 12 years away from the Y2038 problem, when 32-bit flavors of Unix will all cease to work, because they, too, will have run out of computable seconds. These computers haven't changed, their software hasn't changed, but the world &#8211; by dint of ticking over, a second at a time, for 68 years &#8211; will wear through their seams, and they will rupture: https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/23/the_unix_epochalypse_might_be/ The existence of "the world" is an inescapable factor that wears out software and requires it to be rebuilt, often at enormous expense. The longer code is in operation, the more likely it is that it will encounter "the world." Take the code that devices use to report on their physical location. Originally, this was used for things like billing &#8211; determining which carrier or provider's network you were using and whether you were roaming. Then, our mobile devices used this code to help determine your location in order to give you turn-by-turn directions in navigation apps. Then, this code was repurposed again to help us find our lost devices. This, in turn, became a way to locate stolen devices, a use-case that sharply diverges from finding lost devices in important ways &#8211; for example, when locating a lost device, you don't have to contend with the possibility that a malicious actor has disabled the "find my lost device" facility. These additional use cases &#8211; upstream, downstream and adjacent &#8211; exposed bugs in the original code that never surfaced in the earlier applications. For example, all location services must have some kind of default behavior in the (very common) event that they're not really sure where they are. Maybe they have a general fix &#8211; for example, they know which cellular mast they're connected to, or they know where they were the last time they got an accurate location fix &#8211; or maybe they're totally lost. It turns out that in many cases, location apps drew a circle around all the places they could be and then set their location to the middle of that circle. That's fine if the circle is only a few feet in diameter, or if the app quickly replaces this approximation with a more precise location. But what if the location is miles and miles across, and the location fix never improves? What if the location for any IP address without a defined location is given as the center of the continental USA and any app that doesn't know where it is reports that it is in a house in Kansas, sending dozens of furious (occasionally armed) strangers to that house, insisting that the owners are in possession of their stolen phones and tablets? https://theweek.com/articles/624040/how-internet-mapping-glitch-turned-kansas-farm-into-digital-hell You don't just have to fix this bug once &#8211; you have to fix it over and over again. In Georgia: https://www.jezebel.com/why-lost-phones-keep-pointing-at-this-atlanta-couples-h-1793854491 In Texas: https://abc7chicago.com/post/find-my-iphone-apple-error-strangers-at-texas-familys-home-scott-schuster/13096627/ And in my town of Burbank, where Google's location-sharing service once told us that our then-11-year-old daughter (whose phone we couldn't reach) was 12 miles away, on a freeway ramp in an unincorporated area of LA county (she was at a nearby park, but out of range, and the app estimated her location as the center of the region it had last fixed her in) (it was a rough couple hours). The underlying code &#8211; the code that uses some once-harmless default to fudge unknown locations &#8211; needs to be updated constantly, because the upstream, downstream and adjacent processes connected to it are changing constantly. The longer that code sits there, the more superannuated its original behaviors become, and the more baroque, crufty and obfuscated the patches layered atop of it become. Code is not an asset &#8211; it's a liability. The longer a computer system has been running, the more tech debt it represents. The more important the system is, the harder it is to bring down and completely redo. Instead, new layers of code are slathered atop of it, and wherever the layers of code meet, there are fissures in which these systems behave in ways that don't exactly match up. Worse still: when two companies are merged, their seamed, fissured IT systems are smashed together, so that now there are adjacent sources of tech debt, as well as upstream and downstream cracks: https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/28/dealer-management-software/#antonin-scalia-stole-your-car That's why giant companies are so susceptible to ransomware attacks &#8211; they're full of incompatible systems that have been coaxed into a facsimile of compatibility with various forms of digital silly putty, string and baling wire. They are not watertight and they cannot be made watertight. Even if they're not taken down by hackers, they sometimes just fall over and can't be stood back up again &#8211; like when Southwest Airlines' computers crashed for all of Christmas week 2022, stranding millions of travelers: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/16/for-petes-sake/#unfair-and-deceptive Airlines are especially bad, because they computerized early, and can't ever shut down the old computers to replace them with new ones. This is why their apps are such dogshit &#8211; and why it's so awful that they've fired their customer service personnel and require fliers to use the apps for everything, even though the apps do. not. work. These apps won't ever work. The reason that British Airways' app displays "An unknown error has occurred" 40-80% of the time isn't (just) that they fired all their IT staff and outsourced to low bidders overseas. It's that, sure &#8211; but also that BA's first computers ran on electromechanical valves, and everything since has to be backwards-compatible with a system that one of Alan Turing's proteges gnawed out of a whole log with his very own front teeth. Code is a liability, not an asset (BA's new app is years behind schedule). Code is a liability. The servers for the Bloomberg terminals that turned Michael Bloomberg into a billionaire run on RISC chips, meaning that the company is locked into using a dwindling number of specialist hardware and data-center vendors, paying specialized programmers, and building brittle chains of code to connect these RISC systems to their less exotic equivalents in the world. Code isn't an asset. AI can write code, but AI can't do software engineering. Software engineering is all about thinking through context &#8211; what will come before this system? What will come after it? What will sit alongside of it? How will the world change? Software engineering requires a very wide "context window," the thing that AI does not, and cannot have. AI has a very narrow and shallow context window, and linear expansions to AI's context window requires geometric expansions in the amount of computational resources the AI consumes: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda Writing code that works, without consideration of how it will fail, is a recipe for catastrophe. It is a way to create tech debt at scale. It is shoveling asbestos into the walls of our technological society. Bosses do not know that code is a liability, not an asset. That's why they won't shut the fuck up about the chatbots that shit out 10,000 times more code than any human programmer. They think they've found a machine that produces assets at 10,000 times the rate of a human programmer. They haven't. They've found a machine that produces liability at 10,000 times the rate of any human programmer. Maintainability isn't just a matter of hard-won experience teaching you where the pitfalls are. It also requires the cultivation of "Fingerspitzengefühl" &#8211; the "fingertip feeling" that lets you make reasonable guesses about where never before seen pitfalls might emerge. It's a form of process knowledge. It is ineluctable. It is not latent in even the largest corpus of code that you could use as training data: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance Boy do tech bosses not get this. Take Microsoft. Their big bet right now is on "agentic AI." They think that if they install spyware on your computer that captures every keystroke, every communication, every screen you see and sends it to Microsoft's cloud and give a menagerie of chatbots access to it, that you'll be able to tell your computer, "Book me a train to Cardiff and find that hotel Cory mentioned last year and book me a room there" and it will do it. This is an incredibly unworkable idea. No chatbot is remotely capable of doing all these things, something that Microsoft freely stipulates. Rather than doing this with one chatbot, Microsoft proposes to break this down among dozens of chatbots, each of which Microsoft hopes to bring up to 95% reliability. That's an utterly implausible chatbot standard in and of itself, but consider this: probabilities are multiplicative. A system containing two processes that operate at 95% reliability has a net reliability of 90.25% (0.95 * 0.95). Break a task down among a couple dozen 95% accurate bots and the chance that this task will be accomplished correctly rounds to zero. Worse, Microsoft is on record as saying that they will grant the Trump administration secret access to all the data in its cloud: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/ So &#8211; as Signal's Meredith Whittaker and Udbhav Tiwari put it in their incredible 39C3 talk last week in Hamburg &#8211; Microsoft is about to abolish the very idea of privacy for any data on personal and corporate computers, in order to ship AI agents that cannot ever work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4 Meanwhile, a Microsoft exec got into trouble last December when he posted to Linkedin announcing his intention to have AI rewrite all of Microsoft's code. Refactoring Microsoft's codebase makes lots of sense. Microsoft &#8211; like British Airways and other legacy firms &#8211; has lots of very old code that represents unsustainable tech debt. But using AI to rewrite that code is a way to start with tech debt that will only accumulate as time goes by: https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/12/24/microsoft-denies-rewriting-windows-11-using-ai-after-an-employees-one-engineer-one-month-one-million-code-post-on-linkedin-causes-outrage/ Now, some of you reading this have heard software engineers extolling the incredible value of using a chatbot to write code for them. Some of you are software engineers who have found chatbots incredibly useful in writing code for you. This is a common AI paradox: why do some people who use AI find it really helpful, while others loathe it? Is it that the people who don't like AI are "bad at AI?" Is it that the AI fans are lazy and don't care about the quality of their work? There's doubtless some of both going on, but even if you teach everyone to be an AI expert, and cull everyone who doesn't take pride in their work out of the sample, the paradox will still remain. The true solution to the AI paradox lies in automation theory, and the concept of "centaurs" and "reverse centaurs": https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/11/vulgar-thatcherism/#there-is-an-alternative In automation theory, a "centaur" is a person who is assisted by a machine. A "reverse centaur" is someone who has been conscripted into assisting a machine. If you're a software engineer who uses AI to write routine code that you have the time and experience to validate, deploying your Fingerspitzengefühl and process knowledge to ensure that it's fit for purpose, it's easy to see why you might find using AI (when you choose to, in ways you choose to, at a pace you choose to go at) to be useful. But if you're a software engineer who's been ordered to produce code at 10x, or 100x, or 10,000x your previous rate, and the only way to do that is via AI, and there is no human way that you could possibly review that code and ensure that it will not break on first contact with the world, you'll hate it (you'll hate it even more if you've been turned into the AI's accountability sink, personally on the hook for the AI's mistakes): https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/27/rancid-vibe-coding/#class-war There's another way in which software engineers find AI-generated code to be incredibly helpful: when that code is isolated. If you're doing a single project &#8211; say, converting one batch of files to another format, just once &#8211; you don't have to worry about downstream, upstream or adjacent processes. There aren't any. You're writing code to do something once, without interacting with any other systems. A lot of coding is this kind of utility project. It's tedious, thankless, and ripe for automation. Lots of personal projects fall into this bucket, and of course, by definition, a personal project is a centaur project. No one forces you to use AI in a personal project &#8211; it's always your choice how and when you make personal use of any tool. But the fact that software engineers can sometimes make their work better with AI doesn't invalidate the fact that code is a liability, not an asset, and that AI code represents liability production at scale. In the story of technological unemployment, there's the idea that new technology creates new jobs even as it makes old ones obsolete: for every blacksmith put out of work by the automobile, there's a job waiting as a mechanic. In the years since the AI bubble began inflating, we've heard lots of versions of this: AI would create jobs for "prompt engineers" &#8211; or even create jobs that we can't imagine, because they won't exist until AI has changed the world beyond recognition. I wouldn't bank on getting work in a fanciful trade that literally can't be imagined because our consciousnesses haven't been so altered by AI that they've acquired the capacity to conceptualize of these new modes of work. But if you are looking for a job that AI will definitely create, by the millions, I have a suggestion: digital asbestos removal. For if AI code &#8211; written at 10,000 times the speed of any human coder, designed to work well, but not to fail gracefully &#8211; is the digital asbestos we're filling our walls with, then our descendants will spend generations digging that asbestos out of the walls. There will be plenty of work fixing the things that we broke thanks to the most dangerous AI psychosis of all &#8211; the hallucinatory belief that "writing code" is the same thing as "software engineering." At the rate we're going, we'll have full employment for generations of asbestos removers.

Colophon: All the rest. Code is a liability (not an asset) (permalink) Code is a liability (not an asset). Tech bosses don&#39;t understand this. They think AI is great because it produces 10,000 times more code than a programmer, but that just means it&#39;s producing 10,000 times more liabilities. AI is the asbestos we&#39;re shoveling into the walls of our high-tech society: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence Code is a liability. Code&#39;s capabilities are assets. The goal of a tech shop is to have code whose capabilities generate more revenue than the costs associated with keeping that code running. For a long time, firms have nurtured a false belief that code costs less to run over time: after an initial shakedown period in which the bugs in the code are found and addressed, code ceases to need meaningful maintenance. After all, code is a machine without moving parts – it does not wear out; it doesn&#39;t even wear down. This is the thesis of Paul Mason&#39;s 2015 book Postcapitalism, a book that has aged remarkably poorly (though not, perhaps, as poorly as Mason&#39;s own political credibility): code is not an infinitely reproducible machine that requires no labor inputs to operate. Rather, it is a brittle machine that requires increasingly heroic measures to keep it in good working order, and which eventually does &#34;wear out&#34; (in the sense of needing a top-to-bottom refactoring). To understand why code is a liability, you have to understand the difference between &#34;writing code&#34; and &#34;software engineering.&#34; &#34;Writing code&#34; is an incredibly useful, fun, and engrossing pastime. It involves breaking down complex tasks into discrete steps that are so precisely described that a computer can reliably perform them, and optimising that performance by finding clever ways of minimizing the demands the code puts on the computer&#39;s resources, such as RAM and processor cycles. Meanwhile, &#34;software engineering&#34; is a discipline that subsumes &#34;writing code,&#34; but with a focus on the long-term operations of the system the code is part of. Software engineering concerns itself with the upstream processes that generate the data the system receives. It concerns itself with the downstream processes that the system emits processed information to. It concerns itself with the adjacent systems that are receiving data from the same upstream processes and/or emitting data to the same downstream processes the system is emitting to. &#34;Writing code&#34; is about making code that runs well. &#34;Software engineering&#34; is about making code that fails well. It&#39;s about making code that is legible – whose functions can be understood by third parties who might be asked to maintain it, or might be asked to adapt the processes downstream, upstream or adjacent to the system to keep the system from breaking. It&#39;s about making code that can be adapted, for example, when the underlying computer architecture it runs on is retired and has to be replaced, either with a new kind of computer, or with an emulated version of the old computer: https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/hpux\_end\_of\_life/ Because that&#39;s the thing: any nontrivial code has to interact with the outside world, and the outside world isn&#39;t static, it&#39;s dynamic. The outside world busts through the assumptions made by software authors all the time and every time it does, the software needs to be fixed. Remember Y2K? That was a day when perfectly functional code, running on perfectly functional hardware, would stop functioning – not because the code changed, but because time marched on. We&#39;re 12 years away from the Y2038 problem, when 32-bit flavors of Unix will all cease to work, because they, too, will have run out of computable seconds. These computers haven&#39;t changed, their software hasn&#39;t changed, but the world – by dint of ticking over, a second at a time, for 68 years – will wear through their seams, and they will rupture: https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/23/the\_unix\_epochalypse\_might\_be/ The existence of &#34;the world&#34; is an inescapable factor that wears out software and requires it to be rebuilt, often at enormous expense. The longer code is in operation, the more likely it is that it will encounter &#34;the world.&#34; Take the code that devices use to report on their physical location. Originally, this was used for things like billing – determining which carrier or provider&#39;s network you were using and whether you were roaming. Then, our mobile devices used this code to help determine your location in order to give you turn-by-turn directions in navigation apps. Then, this code was repurposed again to help us find our lost devices. This, in turn, became a way to locate stolen devices, a use-case that sharply diverges from finding lost devices in important ways – for example, when locating a lost device, you don&#39;t have to contend with the possibility that a malicious actor has disabled the &#34;find my lost device&#34; facility. These additional use cases – upstream, downstream and adjacent – exposed bugs in the original code that never surfaced in the earlier applications. For example, all location services must have some kind of default behavior in the (very common) event that they&#39;re not really sure where they are. Maybe they have a general fix – for example, they know which cellular mast they&#39;re connected to, or they know where they were the last time they got an accurate location fix – or maybe they&#39;re totally lost. It turns out that in many cases, location apps drew a circle around all the places they could be and then set their location to the middle of that circle. That&#39;s fine if the circle is only a few feet in diameter, or if the app quickly replaces this approximation with a more precise location. But what if the location is miles and miles across, and the location fix never improves? What if the location for any IP address without a defined location is given as the center of the continental USA and any app that doesn&#39;t know where it is reports that it is in a house in Kansas, sending dozens of furious (occasionally armed) strangers to that house, insisting that the owners are in possession of their stolen phones and tablets? https://theweek.com/articles/624040/how-internet-mapping-glitch-turned-kansas-farm-into-digital-hell You don&#39;t just have to fix this bug once – you have to fix it over and over again. In Georgia: https://www.jezebel.com/why-lost-phones-keep-pointing-at-this-atlanta-couples-h-1793854491 In Texas: https://abc7chicago.com/post/find-my-iphone-apple-error-strangers-at-texas-familys-home-scott-schuster/13096627/ And in my town of Burbank, where Google&#39;s location-sharing service once told us that our then-11-year-old daughter (whose phone we couldn&#39;t reach) was 12 miles away, on a freeway ramp in an unincorporated area of LA county (she was at a nearby park, but out of range, and the app estimated her location as the center of the region it had last fixed her in) (it was a rough couple hours). The underlying code – the code that uses some once-harmless default to fudge unknown locations – needs to be updated constantly, because the upstream, downstream and adjacent processes connected to it are changing constantly. The longer that code sits there, the more superannuated its original behaviors become, and the more baroque, crufty and obfuscated the patches layered atop of it become. Code is not an asset – it&#39;s a liability. The longer a computer system has been running, the more tech debt it represents. The more important the system is, the harder it is to bring down and completely redo. Instead, new layers of code are slathered atop of it, and wherever the layers of code meet, there are fissures in which these systems behave in ways that don&#39;t exactly match up. Worse still: when two companies are merged, their seamed, fissured IT systems are smashed together, so that now there are adjacent sources of tech debt, as well as upstream and downstream cracks: https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/28/dealer-management-software/#antonin-scalia-stole-your-car That&#39;s why giant companies are so susceptible to ransomware attacks – they&#39;re full of incompatible systems that have been coaxed into a facsimile of compatibility with various forms of digital silly putty, string and baling wire. They are not watertight and they cannot be made watertight. Even if they&#39;re not taken down by hackers, they sometimes just fall over and can&#39;t be stood back up again – like when Southwest Airlines&#39; computers crashed for all of Christmas week 2022, stranding millions of travelers: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/16/for-petes-sake/#unfair-and-deceptive Airlines are especially bad, because they computerized early, and can&#39;t ever shut down the old computers to replace them with new ones. This is why their apps are such dogshit – and why it&#39;s so awful that they&#39;ve fired their customer service personnel and require fliers to use the apps for everything, even though the apps do. not. work. These apps won&#39;t ever work. The reason that British Airways&#39; app displays &#34;An unknown error has occurred&#34; 40-80% of the time isn&#39;t (just) that they fired all their IT staff and outsourced to low bidders overseas. It&#39;s that, sure – but also that BA&#39;s first computers ran on electromechanical valves, and everything since has to be backwards-compatible with a system that one of Alan Turing&#39;s proteges gnawed out of a whole log with his very own front teeth. Code is a liability, not an asset (BA&#39;s new app is years behind schedule). Code is a liability. The servers for the Bloomberg terminals that turned Michael Bloomberg into a billionaire run on RISC chips, meaning that the company is locked into using a dwindling number of specialist hardware and data-center vendors, paying specialized programmers, and building brittle chains of code to connect these RISC systems to their less exotic equivalents in the world. Code isn&#39;t an asset. AI can write code, but AI can&#39;t do software engineering. Software engineering is all about thinking through context – what will come before this system? What will come after it? What will sit alongside of it? How will the world change? Software engineering requires a very wide &#34;context window,&#34; the thing that AI does not, and cannot have. AI has a very narrow and shallow context window, and linear expansions to AI&#39;s context window requires geometric expansions in the amount of computational resources the AI consumes: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda Writing code that works, without consideration of how it will fail, is a recipe for catastrophe. It is a way to create tech debt at scale. It is shoveling asbestos into the walls of our technological society. Bosses do not know that code is a liability, not an asset. That&#39;s why they won&#39;t shut the fuck up about the chatbots that shit out 10,000 times more code than any human programmer. They think they&#39;ve found a machine that produces assets at 10,000 times the rate of a human programmer. They haven&#39;t. They&#39;ve found a machine that produces liability at 10,000 times the rate of any human programmer. Maintainability isn&#39;t just a matter of hard-won experience teaching you where the pitfalls are. It also requires the cultivation of &#34;Fingerspitzengefühl&#34; – the &#34;fingertip feeling&#34; that lets you make reasonable guesses about where never before seen pitfalls might emerge. It&#39;s a form of process knowledge. It is ineluctable. It is not latent in even the largest corpus of code that you could use as training data: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance Boy do tech bosses not get this. Take Microsoft. Their big bet right now is on &#34;agentic AI.&#34; They think that if they install spyware on your computer that captures every keystroke, every communication, every screen you see and sends it to Microsoft&#39;s cloud and give a menagerie of chatbots access to it, that you&#39;ll be able to tell your computer, &#34;Book me a train to Cardiff and find that hotel Cory mentioned last year and book me a room there&#34; and it will do it. This is an incredibly unworkable idea. No chatbot is remotely capable of doing all these things, something that Microsoft freely stipulates. Rather than doing this with one chatbot, Microsoft proposes to break this down among dozens of chatbots, each of which Microsoft hopes to bring up to 95% reliability. That&#39;s an utterly implausible chatbot standard in and of itself, but consider this: probabilities are multiplicative. A system containing two processes that operate at 95% reliability has a net reliability of 90.25% (0.95 \* 0.95). Break a task down among a couple dozen 95% accurate bots and the chance that this task will be accomplished correctly rounds to zero. Worse, Microsoft is on record as saying that they will grant the Trump administration secret access to all the data in its cloud: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/ So – as Signal&#39;s Meredith Whittaker and Udbhav Tiwari put it in their incredible 39C3 talk last week in Hamburg – Microsoft is about to abolish the very idea of privacy for any data on personal and corporate computers, in order to ship AI agents that cannot ever work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4 Meanwhile, a Microsoft exec got into trouble last December when he posted to Linkedin announcing his intention to have AI rewrite all of Microsoft&#39;s code. Refactoring Microsoft&#39;s codebase makes lots of sense. Microsoft – like British Airways and other legacy firms – has lots of very old code that represents unsustainable tech debt. But using AI to rewrite that code is a way to start with tech debt that will only accumulate as time goes by: https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/12/24/microsoft-denies-rewriting-windows-11-using-ai-after-an-employees-one-engineer-one-month-one-million-code-post-on-linkedin-causes-outrage/ Now, some of you reading this have heard software engineers extolling the incredible value of using a chatbot to write code for them. Some of you are software engineers who have found chatbots incredibly useful in writing code for you. This is a common AI paradox: why do some people who use AI find it really helpful, while others loathe it? Is it that the people who don&#39;t like AI are &#34;bad at AI?&#34; Is it that the AI fans are lazy and don&#39;t care about the quality of their work? There&#39;s doubtless some of both going on, but even if you teach everyone to be an AI expert, and cull everyone who doesn&#39;t take pride in their work out of the sample, the paradox will still remain. The true solution to the AI paradox lies in automation theory, and the concept of &#34;centaurs&#34; and &#34;reverse centaurs&#34;: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/11/vulgar-thatcherism/#there-is-an-alternative In automation theory, a &#34;centaur&#34; is a person who is assisted by a machine. A &#34;reverse centaur&#34; is someone who has been conscripted into assisting a machine. If you&#39;re a software engineer who uses AI to write routine code that you have the time and experience to validate, deploying your Fingerspitzengefühl and process knowledge to ensure that it&#39;s fit for purpose, it&#39;s easy to see why you might find using AI (when you choose to, in ways you choose to, at a pace you choose to go at) to be useful. But if you&#39;re a software engineer who&#39;s been ordered to produce code at 10x, or 100x, or 10,000x your previous rate, and the only way to do that is via AI, and there is no human way that you could possibly review that code and ensure that it will not break on first contact with the world, you&#39;ll hate it (you&#39;ll hate it even more if you&#39;ve been turned into the AI&#39;s accountability sink, personally on the hook for the AI&#39;s mistakes): https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/27/rancid-vibe-coding/#class-war There&#39;s another way in which software engineers find AI-generated code to be incredibly helpful: when that code is isolated. If you&#39;re doing a single project – say, converting one batch of files to another format, just once – you don&#39;t have to worry about downstream, upstream or adjacent processes. There aren&#39;t any. You&#39;re writing code to do something once, without interacting with any other systems. A lot of coding is this kind of utility project. It&#39;s tedious, thankless, and ripe for automation. Lots of personal projects fall into this bucket, and of course, by definition, a personal project is a centaur project. No one forces you to use AI in a personal project – it&#39;s always your choice how and when you make personal use of any tool. But the fact that software engineers can sometimes make their work better with AI doesn&#39;t invalidate the fact that code is a liability, not an asset, and that AI code represents liability production at scale. In the story of technological unemployment, there&#39;s the idea that new technology creates new jobs even as it makes old ones obsolete: for every blacksmith put out of work by the automobile, there&#39;s a job waiting as a mechanic. In the years since the AI bubble began inflating, we&#39;ve heard lots of versions of this: AI would create jobs for &#34;prompt engineers&#34; – or even create jobs that we can&#39;t imagine, because they won&#39;t exist until AI has changed the world beyond recognition. I wouldn&#39;t bank on getting work in a fanciful trade that literally can&#39;t be imagined because our consciousnesses haven&#39;t been so altered by AI that they&#39;ve acquired the capacity to conceptualize of these new modes of work. But if you are looking for a job that AI will definitely create, by the millions, I have a suggestion: digital asbestos removal. For if AI code – written at 10,000 times the speed of any human coder, designed to work well, but not to fail gracefully – is the digital asbestos we&#39;re filling our walls with, then our descendants will spend generations digging that asbestos out of the walls. There will be plenty of work fixing the things that we broke thanks to the most dangerous AI psychosis of all – the hallucinatory belief that &#34;writing code&#34; is the same thing as &#34;software engineering.&#34; At the rate we&#39;re going, we&#39;ll have full employment for generations of asbestos removers.

&#62; In my opinion, Apple took on an impossible task: to add an icon to every menu item. There are just not enough good metaphors to do something like that.

I joined the Oxide and Friends podcast [last year](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/10/ai-predictions/) to predict the next 1, 3 and 6 years(!) of AI developments. With hindsight I did very badly, but they&#39;re inviting me back again anyway to have another go.

We will be recording live today at 4pm Pacific on their Discord - [you can join that here](https://discord.com/invite/QrcKGTTPrF), and the podcast version will go out shortly afterwards.

I&#39;ll be recording at their office in Emeryville and then heading to [the Crucible](https://www.thecrucible.org/) to learn how to make neon signs.

      <title>Pluralistic: A world without people (05 Jan 2026)</title>
      <link>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's links A world without people: AI is a promise to wire the boss's toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Adding exclusive rights make economies weaker; Bloggers after the collapse; Why the media can't figure out Wikipedia; Who are these sf legends?; Anne Frank is in the public domain; Hollywood's MP in Canada; Piketty on Piketty; Vanilla ISIS; India throws out Facebook's astroturf emails; Google unionizes; "The Data Detective"; Breaking Apple ][+ DRM. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A world without people (permalink) To be a billionaire is to be a solipsist &#8211; to secretly believe that (most) other people don't really exist &#8211; otherwise, how could you live with the knowledge that your farcical wealth and power springs from the agony you have inflicted on whole populations? https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs This is what it means for Elon Musk to dismiss the people who disagree with him as "NPCs"; in some important sense, he doesn't think other people exist. It's a very ketamine-coded way to move through the world: https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/on-elon-musk-and-npcs Solipsism is a very difficult belief to maintain. No matter how sociopathic you are, there's always going to be a part of you that craves the approval, love and attention of others. That craving is a nagging reminder that other people do, in fact, exist. This creates the very weird insistence on the part of the ultra-rich that they are actually philanthropists. Thus, the very weird spectacle of corporate raiders &#8211; responsible for tens of thousands of job losses &#8211; describing themselves as "job creators," and funding whole economic subdisciplines dedicated to shoring up this absurd claim ("The search for a superior moral justification for selfishness" -JK Galbraith): https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/us/koch-donors-george-mason.html Trying to squeeze this claim through an ever-narrowing credibility aperture forces it into some extremely weird shapes. Take "Effective Altruism," the belief that you should make as much money as possible by working in the most exploitative and destructive fields you can find, in order to fund a program to improve the lives of 53 trillion hypothetical artificial people who will come into existence in 10,000 years: https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-long-run-future Effective Altruism, "job creators" (and other claims to billionaireism as a force for good in the world) show just how much work it takes to maintain the belief that other people don't exist. The ruling classes are haunted by this knowledge, and as more and more wealth accumulates in the hands of fewer and fewer people, those eminently guillotineable plutes need to perform increasingly complex mental gymnastics to keep from confronting the reality of other people. Corporate bosses have near-total control over the lives of their workers, who might number in the hundreds of thousands. But they also know, in their secret hearts, that they don't really control their businesses. If Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stops showing up for work, the company will continue to hum along, not missing a beat. But if all of Amazon's drivers or warehouse workers walk off the job, the company will grind to a halt. If they never come back, the company might never be able to restart, unable to recover the process knowledge that walks out the door with them: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance Andy Jassy wants to think that he's in Amazon's driver's seat, but is haunted by the undeniable reality that Amazon is really in the hands of its lowest-paid, most abused workers. Andy Jassy isn't driving Amazon &#8211; he's stuck in the back seat, playing with a Fisher Price steering-wheel toy. Enter AI. AI can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete Your boss is an easy mark for these AI swindlers, because your boss dreams of a world without workers, because that's a world where bosses are driving the bus. The Hollywood writers' strike was precipitated by studio bosses' fantasy of a world without writers &#8211; a world where studio bosses don't have to be satisfied with giving harebrained notes to writers who don't bother to disguise their contempt for their bosses' shitty ideas. In a world of AI scripts, the boss decides what kind of movie to make, and a chatbot shits out a script to order, without ever telling the boss that the idea stinks. The fact that this is an unshootable turkey of a script is of secondary importance. The most important thing is the boss's all-consuming need to avoid ego-shattering conflicts with people who actually know how to do things, who gain power thanks to that knowledge, and who use that power to imply (or state outright) that you're a fucking dunce. Same goes for the Hollywood actors' strike, and the continued project of cloning actors in software and puppeteering them via chatbot: it's the fantasy of a movie without actors, actors who tell you that the scenario you've spun is an incoherent mess, who insist that their expertise in an art you don't understand and can't perform yourself entitles them to challenge your ideas. AI is solipsism, the fantasy of a world without people. Bosses keep pushing the idea that AI can replace doctors and (especially) nurses. Health bosses &#8211; increasingly likely to be a giant private equity fund &#8211; want to cut care in order to direct more money to the hospital's shareholders. They want to stop paying exterminators and allow their hospitals to fill up with thousands of bats: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/28/5000-bats/#charnel-house They want to stop paying for clean needles at dialysis clinics and transmit blood-borne chronic illnesses to immunocompromised, sick patients: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-dirty-business-of-clean-blood They want to use algorithmic death panels to eject sick patients from their beds before they can sit up, walk or, you know, survive: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/05/any-metric-becomes-a-target/#hca The problem is that nurses and doctors are professionals, and that means &#8211; by definition &#8211; that they follow a professional code of ethics that requires them to refuse their bosses' orders when those orders are bad for patients. The same goes for shrinks of all kinds &#8211; psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and counselors. They are legally and professionally required to put patients' mental health ahead of commercial imperatives. That's a big problem for any boss who wants to swap out in-person counseling for dial-a-doc shrink-on-demand services delivered via videoconference that serve up a new therapist every time the patient dials in, chasing the lowest wages around the country or the globe. The mania for "AI therapists" isn't driven by efficiency or by our societal mental health crisis &#8211; it's driven by the fantasy of mental health counseling without counselors (who insist on minimum standards for patient care): https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/01/doctor-robo-blabbermouth/#fool-me-once-etc-etc Capitalism is a single-criterion optimization: it organizes itself around the accumulation of capital, to the exclusion of all other criteria: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59821b9ff14aa110e16b69c0/t/686621934eb5b7060da1cdaf/1751523732570/Aaron+Benanav%2C+Beyond+Capitalism+1%2C+NLR+153%2C+May+June+2025.pdf This means that capitalism is forever locked in a conflict with professionalism, since professionalism is a system that upholds a code of conduct before all other priorities, including capital accumulation. Professional ethics are, quite simply, bad for business. That's why bosses fantasize so furiously about pushing AI into professional situations &#8211; it's the fantasy of a profession without professionals. AI schoolteachers mean "education without educators," which means that there's no organized group of trained and trusted professionals telling you that chatbot slop, high-stakes testing, and standardized curriculum will fail students. This is true no matter how much money you stand to make by replacing the skilled craft process of teaching with automation. Professions are infamously resistant to automation, unlike, say, manufacturing. This means that the cost of professional services steadily increases, relative to the cost of manufactured goods. The labor, energy, materials and time it took to travel from New York to Vienna have plummeted since the 18th century &#8211; but the number of hours it takes a Viennese string quartet to perform Mozart's String Quartet No 1 is the same today as it was in 1773 &#8211; about half an hour. The cost of producing a chalkboard has crashed over the past two centuries &#8211; but the number of hours it takes a math teacher to show a classroom full of ten year olds how to do long division has hardly budged. The cost of producing a scalpel is lower today than at any time in history, but the duration of an appendectomy has only decreased a little over the past century. Economists have a name for this: they call it "cost disease." The fact that automation makes professional services (proportionally) more expensive over time isn't an indictment of professionalism, it's a testament to the power of automation for manufacturing. Bosses (should) know this, but they constantly bemoan the cost of professional services, as though the numerator (teaching, healthcare, screenwriting) is going up, when it's actually a shrinking denominator (automated manufacturing processes) that's increasing the relative price. The AI fantasy is a fantasy of dismantling the professions and replacing them with pliable chatbots who can be optimized for profits and thus cure cost disease for once and for all, and if that comes at the expense of the value that society derives from professional activities, that's a small price to pay for finally clearing the most stubborn barrier to capital accumulation. Last year, Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE fired or forced out a critical mass of government scientists, even as they gutted funding to research programs at the country's universities. You'd think that this would be a barrier to making scientific breakthroughs in America, but not according to Trump. He's promised that America will produce annual "moonshot"-scale breakthroughs, without scientists, by asking a chatbot to shit out paradigm-shattering scientific leaps on demand: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trump-spent-2025-attacking-science-that-could-set-back-his-genesis-mission/ The problem is that while AIs can shit out sentences that seem to qualify as scientific breakthroughs, they can't actually do science. Take Google's claim that its Deepmind product had advanced material science by 800 years, "discovering 2.2 million structures." It turns out that these "discoveries" are useless &#8211; in that they constitute trivial variations on known materials, and/or have no uses, and/or can only exist at absolute zero: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c00643 But the fact that a chatbot can't do science isn't important to Trump &#8211; or at least, not as important as all the other things a chatbot won't do. A chatbot won't tell Trump not to stare at an eclipse. A chatbot won't tell Trump not to inject bleach. A chatbot won't tell Trump that trans people exist. A chatbot won't tell Trump that the climate emergency is real. A chatbot will agree with Trump when he says that offshore wind kills whales and that Tylenol causes autism. For Trump, the fantasy of science without scientists is more important than whether any science happens. America needs science, but for Trump &#8211; a billionaire solipsist &#8211; America is a country populated by people who mostly don't really exist. That's true of tech bosses, too. After all, they were the original suckers for Effective Altruism and the fantasy of a world without people. Remember when Mark Zuckerberg announced that the average person has three friends, but wants 15 friends, and that he would solve this with chatbots? https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mark-zuckerberg-on-ai-friendships_l_681a4bf3e4b0c2b15d96851d Sure, we all dunked on him for being such an unlikable fucking Martian that he doesn't understand what a "friend" is. But I don't think that's what's actually going on there: it's not that Zuck doesn't understand what friends are; it's that he treats your friendships as problems to be solved. Your friends' behavior determines how much money Zuck can make. When your friends arrange their interactions with you in a way that increases how much time you spend on his platforms, Zuckerberg maximizes the number of ads he gets to show you and thus how much money he can make. The fact that your friends stubbornly refuse to help him maximize his capital accumulation is a problem, and the solution to that problem is chatbots, which can be instructed to relate to you in ways that are optimized for increasing Zuck's wealth. For Zuck, chatbots are a fantasy of a social network without socializing. It's not just users that tech bosses fantasize about replacing with AI, though &#8211; they really want to get rid of coders. Computer programmers aren't (formally) a profession, but they are quite powerful, and have a cultural norm of criticizing their bosses' stupid ideas: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/10/the-proletarianization-of-tech-workers/ Tech bosses are completely dependent on coders, who know how to do things they don't know how to do, and aren't shy about letting them know it. That's why tech bosses are so quick to equate "writing code" with "software engineering" (the latter being a discipline that requires consideration of upstream, downstream and adjacent processes while prioritizing legibility and maintainability by future generations of engineers). A chatbot can produce software routines that perform some well-scoped task, but one thing they can't do is maintain the wide, deep "context window" at the heart of software engineering &#8211; a linear increase in a chatbot's context window results in a geometric increase in the amount of computation the chatbot has to perform: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda But the fact that chatbots will produce technical debt at scale is less important to tech bosses than the fact that a chatbot will do what you tell it without giving the boss any lip. For tech bosses, chatbots are the fantasy of a coding shop without any coders. This is a bad joke, literally. When I worked in a shop, we used to sarcastically say, "Retail would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers." We were unknowingly reprising Brecht, whose "Die Lösung" contains the immortal line, "Would it not be simpler if the government simply dissolved the people and elected another?" Billionaires don't see the humor. For them, AI is a chance to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the firm's drive-train, and make movies without writers or actors, factories without workers, hospitals without nurses, schools without teachers, science without scientists, code shops without coders, social media without socializing, and yes, even retail without the fucking customers. Billionaires love the idea of "Universal Basic Income." For them, this is the apotheosis of the AI fantasy of a world without people. In this fantasy, the boss's toy steering wheel is steering the firm. Business consists of a boss and a computer that turns the boss's ideas into products. Who will consume these products? You will, thanks to UBI &#8211; the government will continue to exist in this fantasy, but for the sole purpose of creating new money and dispersing it to you, so that you can turn it over to billionaires who singlehandedly direct all of society's functions. Billionaires love UBI for the same reason they love charter schools. In the AI UBI fantasy, everyone who's not a billionaire has been replaced with a chatbot, and our only job is to receive government vouchers that we hand over to billionaire grifters who run the institutions that used to be under democratic control. We no longer vote with our ballots &#8211; only with our wallets, and in the wallet election, we only get the ballots that billionaires decide we deserve, and can only direct them between choices that are as meaningless as "Mac vs Windows" or "Coke vs Pepsi." A world optimized for capital accumulation. It's a world without people.

A world without people (permalink) To be a billionaire is to be a solipsist – to secretly believe that (most) other people don&#39;t really exist – otherwise, how could you live with the knowledge that your farcical wealth and power springs from the agony you have inflicted on whole populations? https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/18/seeing-like-a-billionaire/#npcs This is what it means for Elon Musk to dismiss the people who disagree with him as &#34;NPCs&#34;; in some important sense, he doesn&#39;t think other people exist. It&#39;s a very ketamine-coded way to move through the world: https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/on-elon-musk-and-npcs Solipsism is a very difficult belief to maintain. No matter how sociopathic you are, there&#39;s always going to be a part of you that craves the approval, love and attention of others. That craving is a nagging reminder that other people do, in fact, exist. This creates the very weird insistence on the part of the ultra-rich that they are actually philanthropists. Thus, the very weird spectacle of corporate raiders – responsible for tens of thousands of job losses – describing themselves as &#34;job creators,&#34; and funding whole economic subdisciplines dedicated to shoring up this absurd claim (&#34;The search for a superior moral justification for selfishness&#34; -JK Galbraith): https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/us/koch-donors-george-mason.html Trying to squeeze this claim through an ever-narrowing credibility aperture forces it into some extremely weird shapes. Take &#34;Effective Altruism,&#34; the belief that you should make as much money as possible by working in the most exploitative and destructive fields you can find, in order to fund a program to improve the lives of 53 trillion hypothetical artificial people who will come into existence in 10,000 years: https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-long-run-future Effective Altruism, &#34;job creators&#34; (and other claims to billionaireism as a force for good in the world) show just how much work it takes to maintain the belief that other people don&#39;t exist. The ruling classes are haunted by this knowledge, and as more and more wealth accumulates in the hands of fewer and fewer people, those eminently guillotineable plutes need to perform increasingly complex mental gymnastics to keep from confronting the reality of other people. Corporate bosses have near-total control over the lives of their workers, who might number in the hundreds of thousands. But they also know, in their secret hearts, that they don&#39;t really control their businesses. If Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stops showing up for work, the company will continue to hum along, not missing a beat. But if all of Amazon&#39;s drivers or warehouse workers walk off the job, the company will grind to a halt. If they never come back, the company might never be able to restart, unable to recover the process knowledge that walks out the door with them: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance Andy Jassy wants to think that he&#39;s in Amazon&#39;s driver&#39;s seat, but is haunted by the undeniable reality that Amazon is really in the hands of its lowest-paid, most abused workers. Andy Jassy isn&#39;t driving Amazon – he&#39;s stuck in the back seat, playing with a Fisher Price steering-wheel toy. Enter AI. AI can&#39;t do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can&#39;t do your job: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete Your boss is an easy mark for these AI swindlers, because your boss dreams of a world without workers, because that&#39;s a world where bosses are driving the bus. The Hollywood writers&#39; strike was precipitated by studio bosses&#39; fantasy of a world without writers – a world where studio bosses don&#39;t have to be satisfied with giving harebrained notes to writers who don&#39;t bother to disguise their contempt for their bosses&#39; shitty ideas. In a world of AI scripts, the boss decides what kind of movie to make, and a chatbot shits out a script to order, without ever telling the boss that the idea stinks. The fact that this is an unshootable turkey of a script is of secondary importance. The most important thing is the boss&#39;s all-consuming need to avoid ego-shattering conflicts with people who actually know how to do things, who gain power thanks to that knowledge, and who use that power to imply (or state outright) that you&#39;re a fucking dunce. Same goes for the Hollywood actors&#39; strike, and the continued project of cloning actors in software and puppeteering them via chatbot: it&#39;s the fantasy of a movie without actors, actors who tell you that the scenario you&#39;ve spun is an incoherent mess, who insist that their expertise in an art you don&#39;t understand and can&#39;t perform yourself entitles them to challenge your ideas. AI is solipsism, the fantasy of a world without people. Bosses keep pushing the idea that AI can replace doctors and (especially) nurses. Health bosses – increasingly likely to be a giant private equity fund – want to cut care in order to direct more money to the hospital&#39;s shareholders. They want to stop paying exterminators and allow their hospitals to fill up with thousands of bats: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/28/5000-bats/#charnel-house They want to stop paying for clean needles at dialysis clinics and transmit blood-borne chronic illnesses to immunocompromised, sick patients: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-dirty-business-of-clean-blood They want to use algorithmic death panels to eject sick patients from their beds before they can sit up, walk or, you know, survive: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/05/any-metric-becomes-a-target/#hca The problem is that nurses and doctors are professionals, and that means – by definition – that they follow a professional code of ethics that requires them to refuse their bosses&#39; orders when those orders are bad for patients. The same goes for shrinks of all kinds – psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and counselors. They are legally and professionally required to put patients&#39; mental health ahead of commercial imperatives. That&#39;s a big problem for any boss who wants to swap out in-person counseling for dial-a-doc shrink-on-demand services delivered via videoconference that serve up a new therapist every time the patient dials in, chasing the lowest wages around the country or the globe. The mania for &#34;AI therapists&#34; isn&#39;t driven by efficiency or by our societal mental health crisis – it&#39;s driven by the fantasy of mental health counseling without counselors (who insist on minimum standards for patient care): https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/01/doctor-robo-blabbermouth/#fool-me-once-etc-etc Capitalism is a single-criterion optimization: it organizes itself around the accumulation of capital, to the exclusion of all other criteria: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59821b9ff14aa110e16b69c0/t/686621934eb5b7060da1cdaf/1751523732570/Aaron+Benanav%2C+Beyond+Capitalism+1%2C+NLR+153%2C+May+June+2025.pdf This means that capitalism is forever locked in a conflict with professionalism, since professionalism is a system that upholds a code of conduct before all other priorities, including capital accumulation. Professional ethics are, quite simply, bad for business. That&#39;s why bosses fantasize so furiously about pushing AI into professional situations – it&#39;s the fantasy of a profession without professionals. AI schoolteachers mean &#34;education without educators,&#34; which means that there&#39;s no organized group of trained and trusted professionals telling you that chatbot slop, high-stakes testing, and standardized curriculum will fail students. This is true no matter how much money you stand to make by replacing the skilled craft process of teaching with automation. Professions are infamously resistant to automation, unlike, say, manufacturing. This means that the cost of professional services steadily increases, relative to the cost of manufactured goods. The labor, energy, materials and time it took to travel from New York to Vienna have plummeted since the 18th century – but the number of hours it takes a Viennese string quartet to perform Mozart&#39;s String Quartet No 1 is the same today as it was in 1773 – about half an hour. The cost of producing a chalkboard has crashed over the past two centuries – but the number of hours it takes a math teacher to show a classroom full of ten year olds how to do long division has hardly budged. The cost of producing a scalpel is lower today than at any time in history, but the duration of an appendectomy has only decreased a little over the past century. Economists have a name for this: they call it &#34;cost disease.&#34; The fact that automation makes professional services (proportionally) more expensive over time isn&#39;t an indictment of professionalism, it&#39;s a testament to the power of automation for manufacturing. Bosses (should) know this, but they constantly bemoan the cost of professional services, as though the numerator (teaching, healthcare, screenwriting) is going up, when it&#39;s actually a shrinking denominator (automated manufacturing processes) that&#39;s increasing the relative price. The AI fantasy is a fantasy of dismantling the professions and replacing them with pliable chatbots who can be optimized for profits and thus cure cost disease for once and for all, and if that comes at the expense of the value that society derives from professional activities, that&#39;s a small price to pay for finally clearing the most stubborn barrier to capital accumulation. Last year, Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE fired or forced out a critical mass of government scientists, even as they gutted funding to research programs at the country&#39;s universities. You&#39;d think that this would be a barrier to making scientific breakthroughs in America, but not according to Trump. He&#39;s promised that America will produce annual &#34;moonshot&#34;-scale breakthroughs, without scientists, by asking a chatbot to shit out paradigm-shattering scientific leaps on demand: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trump-spent-2025-attacking-science-that-could-set-back-his-genesis-mission/ The problem is that while AIs can shit out sentences that seem to qualify as scientific breakthroughs, they can&#39;t actually do science. Take Google&#39;s claim that its Deepmind product had advanced material science by 800 years, &#34;discovering 2.2 million structures.&#34; It turns out that these &#34;discoveries&#34; are useless – in that they constitute trivial variations on known materials, and/or have no uses, and/or can only exist at absolute zero: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c00643 But the fact that a chatbot can&#39;t do science isn&#39;t important to Trump – or at least, not as important as all the other things a chatbot won&#39;t do. A chatbot won&#39;t tell Trump not to stare at an eclipse. A chatbot won&#39;t tell Trump not to inject bleach. A chatbot won&#39;t tell Trump that trans people exist. A chatbot won&#39;t tell Trump that the climate emergency is real. A chatbot will agree with Trump when he says that offshore wind kills whales and that Tylenol causes autism. For Trump, the fantasy of science without scientists is more important than whether any science happens. America needs science, but for Trump – a billionaire solipsist – America is a country populated by people who mostly don&#39;t really exist. That&#39;s true of tech bosses, too. After all, they were the original suckers for Effective Altruism and the fantasy of a world without people. Remember when Mark Zuckerberg announced that the average person has three friends, but wants 15 friends, and that he would solve this with chatbots? https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mark-zuckerberg-on-ai-friendships\_l\_681a4bf3e4b0c2b15d96851d Sure, we all dunked on him for being such an unlikable fucking Martian that he doesn&#39;t understand what a &#34;friend&#34; is. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s actually going on there: it&#39;s not that Zuck doesn&#39;t understand what friends are; it&#39;s that he treats your friendships as problems to be solved. Your friends&#39; behavior determines how much money Zuck can make. When your friends arrange their interactions with you in a way that increases how much time you spend on his platforms, Zuckerberg maximizes the number of ads he gets to show you and thus how much money he can make. The fact that your friends stubbornly refuse to help him maximize his capital accumulation is a problem, and the solution to that problem is chatbots, which can be instructed to relate to you in ways that are optimized for increasing Zuck&#39;s wealth. For Zuck, chatbots are a fantasy of a social network without socializing. It&#39;s not just users that tech bosses fantasize about replacing with AI, though – they really want to get rid of coders. Computer programmers aren&#39;t (formally) a profession, but they are quite powerful, and have a cultural norm of criticizing their bosses&#39; stupid ideas: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/10/the-proletarianization-of-tech-workers/ Tech bosses are completely dependent on coders, who know how to do things they don&#39;t know how to do, and aren&#39;t shy about letting them know it. That&#39;s why tech bosses are so quick to equate &#34;writing code&#34; with &#34;software engineering&#34; (the latter being a discipline that requires consideration of upstream, downstream and adjacent processes while prioritizing legibility and maintainability by future generations of engineers). A chatbot can produce software routines that perform some well-scoped task, but one thing they can&#39;t do is maintain the wide, deep &#34;context window&#34; at the heart of software engineering – a linear increase in a chatbot&#39;s context window results in a geometric increase in the amount of computation the chatbot has to perform: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda But the fact that chatbots will produce technical debt at scale is less important to tech bosses than the fact that a chatbot will do what you tell it without giving the boss any lip. For tech bosses, chatbots are the fantasy of a coding shop without any coders. This is a bad joke, literally. When I worked in a shop, we used to sarcastically say, &#34;Retail would be great if it wasn&#39;t for the fucking customers.&#34; We were unknowingly reprising Brecht, whose &#34;Die Lösung&#34; contains the immortal line, &#34;Would it not be simpler if the government simply dissolved the people and elected another?&#34; Billionaires don&#39;t see the humor. For them, AI is a chance to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the firm&#39;s drive-train, and make movies without writers or actors, factories without workers, hospitals without nurses, schools without teachers, science without scientists, code shops without coders, social media without socializing, and yes, even retail without the fucking customers. Billionaires love the idea of &#34;Universal Basic Income.&#34; For them, this is the apotheosis of the AI fantasy of a world without people. In this fantasy, the boss&#39;s toy steering wheel is steering the firm. Business consists of a boss and a computer that turns the boss&#39;s ideas into products. Who will consume these products? You will, thanks to UBI – the government will continue to exist in this fantasy, but for the sole purpose of creating new money and dispersing it to you, so that you can turn it over to billionaires who singlehandedly direct all of society&#39;s functions. Billionaires love UBI for the same reason they love charter schools. In the AI UBI fantasy, everyone who&#39;s not a billionaire has been replaced with a chatbot, and our only job is to receive government vouchers that we hand over to billionaire grifters who run the institutions that used to be under democratic control. We no longer vote with our ballots – only with our wallets, and in the wallet election, we only get the ballots that billionaires decide we deserve, and can only direct them between choices that are as meaningless as &#34;Mac vs Windows&#34; or &#34;Coke vs Pepsi.&#34; A world optimized for capital accumulation. It&#39;s a world without people.

        <p>I made an input method to write Baybayin, a syllable-based writing system, using Roman letters on a hardware keyboard. <small>Banner photo lifted from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/fesl6p/gc60_x_baybayin_keycaps/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> showing Baybayin keycaps. This post is about a real Baybayin keyboard though.</small></p>
        
        <h2>The writing system</h2>
        
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin" target="_blank">Baybayin</a> is an ancient writing system in which a consonant-vowel syllable is written as one letter — it is an <strong>abugida</strong>. By default, letters have an inherent vowel which is /a/. To indicate a different vowel, a dot is added above or below the letter.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><i baybay=""><ruby>ᜃ<rp> (</rp><rt>ka</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></i>: The base letter on its own is the consonant plus the vowel <i>‘a’</i>.
          </li><li><i baybay=""><ruby>ᜃᜒ<rp> (</rp><rt>ki</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></i>: A dot above makes it end with <i>‘i’</i> / <i>‘e’</i>.
          </li><li><i baybay=""><ruby>ᜃᜓ<rp> (</rp><rt>ku</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></i>: A dot below makes it end with <i>‘u’</i> / <i>‘o’</i>.
          </li><li><i baybay=""><ruby>ᜃ᜕<rp> (</rp><rt>k</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></i>: A slash cancels the vowel (it’s called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virama" target="_blank"><strong>virama</strong></a>).
        </li></ol>
        
        <p>An example of a full word is <i baybay=""><ruby>ᜆ<rt>ta</rt>ᜆ᜕<rt>t</rt>ᜎᜓ<rt>lo</rt><rp>(tatlo)</rp></ruby></i>, which means the number three.</p>
        <box-note><strong>HTML tip:</strong> I’m using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/ruby" target="_blank"><code>&lt;ruby&gt;</code></a> element to annotate Baybayin pronunciation in this post, similar to furigana for Japanese.</box-note>
        <h2>Input design</h2>
        
        <p>There are many ways to design an input method for this writing system on a keyboard. The most straightforward would be to have a key for each letter. Assign every possible letter-diacritic combination its own key. There’d be a total of 63 resulting letters, which is a bit too much for a keyboard. For comparison, the Latin alphabet A-Z only has 26 letters.</p>
        
        <p>Layer or modes could help, accessed by holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Fn</kbd> key — after all, the Latin alphabet actually has 52 distinct symbols, counting both upper and lowercase.</p>

          <figcaption>In this design, pressing Shift would change the vowel endings.
        </figcaption></figure>
        
        <p>Or we could assign only the 17 base letters and the 3 vowel diacritics for a total of 20 keys for input. This would be a pretty efficient layout, and it’s the one used by Google’s mobile keyboard Gboard. Some logic on top of this would be required to combine diacritics and letters.</p>
        
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Gboard Baybayin layout
        </figcaption></figure>
        
        <p>However, both of the above would require learning a whole new keyboard layout, wasting years of Latin alphabet-based muscle memory. For me who primarily uses the Latin alphabet for typing, this is worth considering.</p>
        
        <p>Let’s say I wanted to type in romanised alphabet, like romaji for Japanese or pinyin for Chinese. What if the keyboard itself can be programmed to convert keystrokes directly into Baybayin outputs? Implementing this on the hardware presents a nice challenge; one keypress would no longer directly correspond to one character.</p>
        
        <h2>My solution</h2>
        
        <p>I implemented this on top of a <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank">QMK</a> firmware base, making use of its neat Unicode API. This runs my keyboard’s microcontroller.</p>
        
        <p>It’s a pretty basic solution, just a bunch of if-elses and variables. We don’t need a buffer or a trie or whatever data structure. It only needs to know about the last pressed key. <small>Well, it’s a buffer of length 1.</small></p>
        
        <pre><code>void on_key_press(uint16_t keycode) {
          bool curr_cons  = is_consonant(keycode);
          bool prev_cons  = is_consonant(prev_keycode);
          bool curr_vowel = !curr_cons;
          // special case for NG
          bool is_ng = prev_keycode == KEYCODE_N &amp;&amp; keycode == KEYCODE_G;
        
          // standalone vowel
          if (curr_vowel &amp;&amp; !prev_cons) {
            send_unicode(get_baybayin_unicode(keycode));
          }
          // initial consonant
          else if (curr_cons &amp;&amp; !is_ng) {
            send_unicode(get_baybayin_unicode(keycode));
            send_unicode("᜕"); // virama, because no vowel initially
          }
          // vowel after consonant
          else if (curr_vowel &amp;&amp; prev_cons) {
            backspace(); // remove the initial virama
        
            if (keycode == KEYCODE_I || keycode == KEYCODE_E) {
              send_unicode("ᜒ");
            } else if (keycode == KEYCODE_U || keycode == KEYCODE_O) {
              send_unicode("ᜓ");
            }
            // KEYCODE_A emits nothing since /a/ is the default vowel
          }
          // NG digraph
          else { // is_ng
            // replace previous N with the letter for NG
            backspace(); // remove virama
            backspace(); // remove ᜈ
            send_unicode("ᜅ");
            send_unicode("᜕");
          }
        
          prev_keycode = keycode;
        }</code></pre>
        
        <p>The code shown here is just the core loop for readability. Not shown is how to handle interference from other keys such as Backspace and Arrow keys and other housekeeping.</p>
        
        <h2>Housekeeping</h2>
        
        <p>Whenever a non-alphabet key is pressed, I just reset all state and skip further processing. This solves keyboard shortcuts: if I press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> I want to save, not output <i baybay=""><ruby>ᜐ᜕<rt>s</rt></ruby></i>.</p>
        
        <p>This also solves a stale <code>prev_keycode</code>. When you press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> for example, <code>prev_keycode</code> is no longer accurate. A buffer would actually help here, but it’d unnecessarily complicate the code. Cursor movement keys <kbd>←</kbd>, <kbd>→</kbd>, or any other non-letter key for that matter, <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>.</kbd>, <kbd>F2</kbd>, etc.; all reset state.</p>
        
        <p>This cannot catch any state-invalidating actions that happen outside the keyboard, like selecting text with the mouse! A timeout takes care of these cases. After a short time without typing, state is reset.</p>
        
        <p>Essentially, we only want to convert into Baybayin when continuously typing sequences of letters. Otherwise, it should behave like a regular keyboard.</p>
        
        <p>The full working code is in <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/qmk_firmware/blob/2be68c4e8dc3977aaef1037d82d29ed8a59db903/keyboards/lily58/keymaps/Kalabasa/features/baybayin.c" target="_blank">my QMK fork on GitHub</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Unicode encoding</h2>
        
        <p>The way the Unicode Consortium designed the encoding of the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_1700.html" target="_blank">Tagalog (Baybayin) Unicode block</a> made this solution pretty straightforward. The vowel-modifier diacritics are <strong>combining characters</strong>, which means they can just be output separately, right after the base character. There are no precomposed consonant-vowel symbols.</p>
        
        <pre><code>ᜆ +  ᜕ = ᜆ᜕</code></pre>
        
        <p>The word processing application or text renderer on the computer is what actually renders that sequence of characters as one combined symbol. In a way, one keypress still corresponds to one output character, except for a few special cases.</p>
        
        <h2>Special case: N + G</h2>
        
        <p>One special case is the letter <i baybay="">ᜅ</i>, representing the consonant /ŋ/. In English this sound is represented by two letters <i>‘ng’</i>. This romanisation breaks the rule of 1 Roman consonant letter to 1 Baybayin base letter. For example, <i>‘ngiti’</i> (meaning ‘smile’) is written as <i baybay=""><ruby>ᜅᜒ<rt>ngi</rt>ᜆᜒ<rt>ti</rt></ruby></i>. This special case is solved by <em>backtracking:</em> sending a signal to the computer to erase the previous N.</p>
        
        <h2>Backtracking</h2>
        
        <p>To backtrack, we just send a virtual Backspace to the computer. Coming from the keyboard, it will be indistinguishable from a real Backspace keypress.</p>
        
        <p>Backtracking is a thing mainly because the virama (‘vowel-killer’) is always output after typing a consonant. This is because when the user presses a consonant, we don’t know yet whether they’re going to type a syllable or stop at that point. <strong>Since base letters have an inherent vowel, we must immediately kill the inherent vowel with a virama when typing consonants.</strong> Only the next key will decide — we can backtrack the virama by then.</p>
        
        <p>The following simulation illustrates how the keyboard-based solution handles backtracking:</p>

        Alternative name: Figure
        Alternative text: simulation of the input method</pre>
        
        <p>So pressing, say, the <kbd>M</kbd> key should not output just the base letter <i baybay=""><ruby>ᜋ<rp> (</rp><rt>ma</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></i>, but the letter + virama <i baybay="">ᜋ᜕</i> at once. If you press <kbd>A</kbd> next, it would <em>actually output a Backspace</em>, erasing the virama and leaving <i baybay=""><ruby>ᜋ<rp> (</rp><rt>ma</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></i> as intended. If you had pressed <kbd>I</kbd>, a Backspace is sent along with the I vowel diacritic <span>ᜒ</span>, producing <i baybay=""><ruby>ᜋᜒ<rp> (</rp><rt>mi</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></i>.</p>
        
        <p>Because of the inherent vowel in most abugidas, a backtracking design seems to be used in other romanised input methods as well, such as <a href="https://anjal.net/" target="_blank">Anjal</a>, a romanised input method for Tamil.</p>
        
        <h2>Why not a buffer instead of backtracking?</h2>
        
        <p>Buffering keystrokes would remove the need to backtrack outputs, at the cost of responsiveness. In that setup, pressing a consonant would produce no glyph at all until the following key disambiguates the syllable and flushes the output. Loss of immediate visual feedback would make the keyboard feel unresponsive and breaks the rhythm of typing.</p>

        <p>One of the downsides of a hardware-based solution is that we can only communicate via keycodes<sup>1</sup>. A software-based input method <em>editor</em> (IME) doesn’t have these restrictions; it can easily <em>edit</em> the string, access the undo stack, get the currently selected text, and more. This would eliminate the need for aggressive state invalidation and timeouts. There are pros and cons.</p>
        
        <h2>Why not implement a software IME?</h2>
        
        <p>Because it’s more fun to hack on keyboard firmware!</p>
        
        <p>More seriously, implementing this on the hardware makes it portable. Not that I often need to write Baybayin, but I use multiple computers with a KVM switch. Software input methods are very OS- or application-dependent. (On Linux, it depends on even more things, such as your desktop environment, GTK or QT, X or Wayland, you name it.) <em>This</em> input method lives in <em>my</em> keyboard. I could plug my keyboard into any computer that supports arbitrary Unicode input<sup>1</sup> and not have to install or reimplement anything.</p>
        <box-note>Someone did <a href="https://inurwansah.my.id/2021/04/17/philippine-scripts-keyboard-for-linux/" target="_blank">make an input method for Baybayin</a> and other Philippine scripts for Linux (<a href="https://github.com/Ilhamkang/Phillippines-input-method" target="_blank">Github</a>).</box-note>
        <h2><sup>1</sup>How does a keyboard even output Unicode?</h2>
        
        <p>Technically, it can’t. It requires a certain understanding with the computer OS.</p>
        
        <p>You know the Alt codes in Windows where you can summon any character by their code number? The keyboard basically types that sequence of keystrokes in quick succession when we say ‘send unicode’. This abstraction is all done by QMK, supporting Windows, Linux, and Mac’s Unicode input method.</p>
        
        <p>To enter <code>U+1700</code> on Linux for example, the keyboard rapidly sends the following keystrokes in order: Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>. <kbd>U</kbd>. <kbd>1</kbd>. <kbd>7</kbd>. <kbd>0</kbd>. <kbd>0</kbd>. <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Release <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. Release <kbd>Shift</kbd>. This outputs a <i baybay="">ᜀ</i>.</p>
        
        <p>With all of the above logic, when I type <kbd>T</kbd><kbd>A</kbd>, the actual keycodes sent are: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>U</kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>7</kbd><kbd>0</kbd><kbd>6</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>U</kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>7</kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>5</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd><kbd>Backspace</kbd></p>
        
        <p>The same Unicode API from QMK powers <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/my-personalised-keyboard?ref=rss">emoji buttons in my keyboard!</a></p>
        
        <h2>Can this be generalised to other abugidas?</h2>
        
        <p>Baybayin is a relatively simple script, so the implementation here might be on the simpler side. Complications might come in the form of consonant clusters or different ways to join glyphs.</p>
        
        <p>The implementation depends heavily on the Unicode encoding of the script. From what I’ve seen, many other abugidas have been designed in a similar way having vowels encoded as combining characters that modify base consonants. So there’s probably a common pattern of implementation.</p>

      <source:markdown>_For RSS readers: This article contains interactive content available on the [original post on leanrada.com](https://leanrada.com/notes/baybayin_abugida_keyboard_qmk/?ref=rss)._

I made an input method to write Baybayin, a syllable-based writing system, using Roman letters on a hardware keyboard. Banner photo lifted from a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/fesl6p/gc60_x_baybayin_keycaps/) showing Baybayin keycaps. This post is about a real Baybayin keyboard though.

## The writing system

[Baybayin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin) is an ancient writing system in which a consonant-vowel syllable is written as one letter — it is an **abugida**. By default, letters have an inherent vowel which is /a/. To indicate a different vowel, a dot is added above or below the letter.

1. _ᜃ (ka)_: The base letter on its own is the consonant plus the vowel _‘a’_.

2. _ᜃᜒ (ki)_: A dot above makes it end with _‘i’_ / _‘e’_.

3. _ᜃᜓ (ku)_: A dot below makes it end with _‘u’_ / _‘o’_.

4. _ᜃ᜕ (k)_: A slash cancels the vowel (it’s called a [**virama**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virama)).


An example of a full word is _ᜆtaᜆ᜕tᜎᜓlo(tatlo)_, which means the number three.

**HTML tip:** I’m using the [`&#60;ruby&#62;`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/ruby) element to annotate Baybayin pronunciation in this post, similar to furigana for Japanese.

## Input design

There are many ways to design an input method for this writing system on a keyboard. The most straightforward would be to have a key for each letter. Assign every possible letter-diacritic combination its own key. There’d be a total of 63 resulting letters, which is a bit too much for a keyboard. For comparison, the Latin alphabet A-Z only has 26 letters.

Layer or modes could help, accessed by holding the `Shift` or `Fn` key — after all, the Latin alphabet actually has 52 distinct symbols, counting both upper and lowercase.

![](https://leanrada.com/notes/baybayin_abugida_keyboard_qmk/every-combination.png?ref=rss)In this design, pressing Shift would change the vowel endings.

Or we could assign only the 17 base letters and the 3 vowel diacritics for a total of 20 keys for input. This would be a pretty efficient layout, and it’s the one used by Google’s mobile keyboard Gboard. Some logic on top of this would be required to combine diacritics and letters.

However, both of the above would require learning a whole new keyboard layout, wasting years of Latin alphabet-based muscle memory. For me who primarily uses the Latin alphabet for typing, this is worth considering.

Let’s say I wanted to type in romanised alphabet, like romaji for Japanese or pinyin for Chinese. What if the keyboard itself can be programmed to convert keystrokes directly into Baybayin outputs? Implementing this on the hardware presents a nice challenge; one keypress would no longer directly correspond to one character.

## My solution

I implemented this on top of a [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) firmware base, making use of its neat Unicode API. This runs my keyboard’s microcontroller.

It’s a pretty basic solution, just a bunch of if-elses and variables. We don’t need a buffer or a trie or whatever data structure. It only needs to know about the last pressed key. Well, it’s a buffer of length 1.

```
void on_key_press(uint16_t keycode) {
  bool curr_cons  = is_consonant(keycode);
  bool prev_cons  = is_consonant(prev_keycode);
  bool curr_vowel = !curr_cons;
  // special case for NG
  bool is_ng = prev_keycode == KEYCODE_N &#38;&#38; keycode == KEYCODE_G;

  // standalone vowel
  if (curr_vowel &#38;&#38; !prev_cons) {
    send_unicode(get_baybayin_unicode(keycode));
  }
  // initial consonant
  else if (curr_cons &#38;&#38; !is_ng) {
    send_unicode(get_baybayin_unicode(keycode));
    send_unicode(&#34;᜕&#34;); // virama, because no vowel initially
  }
  // vowel after consonant
  else if (curr_vowel &#38;&#38; prev_cons) {
    backspace(); // remove the initial virama

    if (keycode == KEYCODE_I || keycode == KEYCODE_E) {
      send_unicode(&#34;ᜒ&#34;);
    } else if (keycode == KEYCODE_U || keycode == KEYCODE_O) {
      send_unicode(&#34;ᜓ&#34;);
    }
    // KEYCODE_A emits nothing since /a/ is the default vowel
  }
  // NG digraph
  else { // is_ng
    // replace previous N with the letter for NG
    backspace(); // remove virama
    backspace(); // remove ᜈ
    send_unicode(&#34;ᜅ&#34;);
    send_unicode(&#34;᜕&#34;);
  }

  prev_keycode = keycode;
}
```

The code shown here is just the core loop for readability. Not shown is how to handle interference from other keys such as Backspace and Arrow keys and other housekeeping.

## Housekeeping

Whenever a non-alphabet key is pressed, I just reset all state and skip further processing. This solves keyboard shortcuts: if I press `Ctrl` \+ `S` I want to save, not output _ᜐ᜕s_.

This also solves a stale `prev_keycode`. When you press `Backspace` for example, `prev_keycode` is no longer accurate. A buffer would actually help here, but it’d unnecessarily complicate the code. Cursor movement keys `←`, `→`, or any other non-letter key for that matter, `1`, `.`, `F2`, etc.; all reset state.

This cannot catch any state-invalidating actions that happen outside the keyboard, like selecting text with the mouse! A timeout takes care of these cases. After a short time without typing, state is reset.

Essentially, we only want to convert into Baybayin when continuously typing sequences of letters. Otherwise, it should behave like a regular keyboard.

The full working code is in [my QMK fork on GitHub](https://github.com/Kalabasa/qmk_firmware/blob/2be68c4e8dc3977aaef1037d82d29ed8a59db903/keyboards/lily58/keymaps/Kalabasa/features/baybayin.c).

## Unicode encoding

The way the Unicode Consortium designed the encoding of the [Tagalog (Baybayin) Unicode block](https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_1700.html) made this solution pretty straightforward. The vowel-modifier diacritics are **combining characters**, which means they can just be output separately, right after the base character. There are no precomposed consonant-vowel symbols.

```
ᜆ +  ᜕ = ᜆ᜕
```

The word processing application or text renderer on the computer is what actually renders that sequence of characters as one combined symbol. In a way, one keypress still corresponds to one output character, except for a few special cases.

## Special case: N + G

One special case is the letter _ᜅ_, representing the consonant /ŋ/. In English this sound is represented by two letters _‘ng’_. This romanisation breaks the rule of 1 Roman consonant letter to 1 Baybayin base letter. For example, _‘ngiti’_ (meaning ‘smile’) is written as _ᜅᜒngiᜆᜒti_. This special case is solved by _backtracking:_ sending a signal to the computer to erase the previous N.

## Backtracking

To backtrack, we just send a virtual Backspace to the computer. Coming from the keyboard, it will be indistinguishable from a real Backspace keypress.

Backtracking is a thing mainly because the virama (‘vowel-killer’) is always output after typing a consonant. This is because when the user presses a consonant, we don’t know yet whether they’re going to type a syllable or stop at that point. **Since base letters have an inherent vowel, we must immediately kill the inherent vowel with a virama when typing consonants.** Only the next key will decide — we can backtrack the virama by then.

The following simulation illustrates how the keyboard-based solution handles backtracking:

```

So pressing, say, the `M` key should not output just the base letter _ᜋ (ma)_, but the letter + virama _ᜋ᜕_ at once. If you press `A` next, it would _actually output a Backspace_, erasing the virama and leaving _ᜋ (ma)_ as intended. If you had pressed `I`, a Backspace is sent along with the I vowel diacritic ᜒ, producing _ᜋᜒ (mi)_.

Because of the inherent vowel in most abugidas, a backtracking design seems to be used in other romanised input methods as well, such as [Anjal](https://anjal.net/), a romanised input method for Tamil.

## Why not a buffer instead of backtracking?

Buffering keystrokes would remove the need to backtrack outputs, at the cost of responsiveness. In that setup, pressing a consonant would produce no glyph at all until the following key disambiguates the syllable and flushes the output. Loss of immediate visual feedback would make the keyboard feel unresponsive and breaks the rhythm of typing.

 **Input buffering demonstration!**

One of the downsides of a hardware-based solution is that we can only communicate via keycodes1. A software-based input method _editor_ (IME) doesn’t have these restrictions; it can easily _edit_ the string, access the undo stack, get the currently selected text, and more. This would eliminate the need for aggressive state invalidation and timeouts. There are pros and cons.

## Why not implement a software IME?

Because it’s more fun to hack on keyboard firmware!

More seriously, implementing this on the hardware makes it portable. Not that I often need to write Baybayin, but I use multiple computers with a KVM switch. Software input methods are very OS- or application-dependent. (On Linux, it depends on even more things, such as your desktop environment, GTK or QT, X or Wayland, you name it.) _This_ input method lives in _my_ keyboard. I could plug my keyboard into any computer that supports arbitrary Unicode input1 and not have to install or reimplement anything.

Someone did [make an input method for Baybayin](https://inurwansah.my.id/2021/04/17/philippine-scripts-keyboard-for-linux/) and other Philippine scripts for Linux ( [Github](https://github.com/Ilhamkang/Phillippines-input-method)).

## 1How does a keyboard even output Unicode?

Technically, it can’t. It requires a certain understanding with the computer OS.

You know the Alt codes in Windows where you can summon any character by their code number? The keyboard basically types that sequence of keystrokes in quick succession when we say ‘send unicode’. This abstraction is all done by QMK, supporting Windows, Linux, and Mac’s Unicode input method.

To enter `U+1700` on Linux for example, the keyboard rapidly sends the following keystrokes in order: Hold `Ctrl`. Hold `Shift`. `U`. `1`. `7`. `0`. `0`. `Enter`. Release `Ctrl`. Release `Shift`. This outputs a _ᜀ_.

With all of the above logic, when I type `T`  `A`, the actual keycodes sent are: `Ctrl`  `Shift`  `U`  `1`  `7`  `0`  `6`  `Enter`  `Ctrl`  `Shift`  `U`  `1`  `7`  `1`  `5`  `Enter`  `Backspace`

The same Unicode API from QMK powers [emoji buttons in my keyboard!](https://leanrada.com/notes/my-personalised-keyboard?ref=rss)

## Can this be generalised to other abugidas?

Baybayin is a relatively simple script, so the implementation here might be on the simpler side. Complications might come in the form of consonant clusters or different ways to join glyphs.

The implementation depends heavily on the Unicode encoding of the script. From what I’ve seen, many other abugidas have been designed in a similar way having vowels encoded as combining characters that modify base consonants. So there’s probably a common pattern of implementation.

But I will very much disagree with _and_ get mad at product decisions devoid of thought and care. I have no respect for that.

[It’s not really worth my time to respond to such a posture of shipping software](https://mastodon.social/@jimniels/115696622197427043), and yet here I am writing about it. Because I care about the things I choose to (or am required to) use.

So this is my one-time, general-purpose piece of feedback to all such purveyors of digital goods and tools. Just because nobody tells you that what you shipped sucks, doesn’t mean it’s worth keeping. You can’t measure an apathetic response because it is, by definition, the absence of data.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Here’s the new year, same as the old year. Well, not the same, but pretty similar.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21630">At the end of 2024</a>, I wrote:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>It was a year dominated by Ukraine and Gaza. Utterly horrific and unnecessary death courtesy of Putin and Netanyahu</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>See what I mean?</p>
        
        <p>2025 added an extra dose of American carnage with Trump’s psychotic combination of cruelty and incompetence directed at the very foundations of the country. I’ve got to be honest, I’m tired of the USA living rent-free in my head so I’ve issued an eviction notice. It’s not that I don’t have sympathy and empathy for what’s happening there, but a majority of the country voted for this …again. Like a dog voting to have its nose rubbed in its own shit. Maybe this time the lesson will stick.</p>
        
        <p>Anyway, leaving world events aside (yes, please!), I also said this at the end of last year:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>For me personally, 2024 was just fine. I was relatively healthy all year. The people I love were relatively healthy too. I don’t take that for granted.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Again, same. No major health issues in 2025. My loved ones are well. My gratitude grows.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve already written about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22324">how much music I played in 2025</a>. I’m hoping to continue that trajectory in 2026 with lots of sessions. We’re four days into the year and I’ve already had two excellent sessions. There are another three lined up this week.</p>
        
        <p>One of the highlights of 2025 was <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22026">my trip with Jessica to Donegal</a>. Learning Irish by day, playing in sessions by night, all while surrounded by gorgeous scenery. I’ve already got a return trip planned for 2026. I’m also planning to be back in Belfast for the annual <a href="https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/">tradfest</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Other 2025 highlights include:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21971">Curating an excellent edition of UX London</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21680">Releasing the new Salter Cane album</a> and <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21975">playing those songs live</a>—I want to do more of that in 2026.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Most of <a href="https://adactio.com/archive/2025/map">my travel in 2025</a> was either for music or family.</p>
        
        <p>I made three trips to the States to see the in-laws: California, Florida, and most recently, Arizona. I can’t say I feel very comfortable going to the States right now, especially to Florida, where people openly display their intolerance on their T-shirts, and Arizona where they openly display their guns.</p>
        
        <p>I went back to my hometown of Cobh a few times during the year to visit my mother.</p>
        
        <p>Aside from those family trips, I went to Belfast, Donegal, Galway, and Clare in Ireland, Cáceres in Spain, Namur in Belgium, and Amsterdam. Only that last one was work-related. I always make sure to get to CSS Day.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile here on my website, <a href="https://adactio.com/archive/2025">I posted 695 times in 2025</a>. That includes <a href="https://adactio.com/notes/archive/2025">345 notes</a>, <a href="https://adactio.com/links/archive/2025">262 links</a>, and <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/archive/2025">86 blog posts</a>. Here are some I’m quite fond of:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21728">The web on mobile</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22034">Portugeating</a></li>

        <li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22304">Tunes and typefaces</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>All in all, 2025 was a grand year for me. It wasn’t all that different from the year before. I’m at an age where the years aren’t all that differentiated from one another. I’m okay with that because I’m also at an age where I know what brings me joy and satisfaction, and I can focus on those things.</p>
        
        <p>So here’s to 2026, which I hope I will spend doing more of what I did in 2025: playing music, speaking Irish, eating good food, hanging out with friends, reading good books, travelling to interesting places, and staying relatively healthy.</p>

      <source:markdown>Here’s the new year, same as the old year. Well, not the same, but pretty similar.

[At the end of 2024](https://adactio.com/journal/21630), I wrote:

&#62; It was a year dominated by Ukraine and Gaza. Utterly horrific and unnecessary death courtesy of Putin and Netanyahu

See what I mean?

2025 added an extra dose of American carnage with Trump’s psychotic combination of cruelty and incompetence directed at the very foundations of the country. I’ve got to be honest, I’m tired of the USA living rent-free in my head so I’ve issued an eviction notice. It’s not that I don’t have sympathy and empathy for what’s happening there, but a majority of the country voted for this …again. Like a dog voting to have its nose rubbed in its own shit. Maybe this time the lesson will stick.

Anyway, leaving world events aside (yes, please!), I also said this at the end of last year:

&#62; For me personally, 2024 was just fine. I was relatively healthy all year. The people I love were relatively healthy too. I don’t take that for granted.

Again, same. No major health issues in 2025. My loved ones are well. My gratitude grows.

I’ve already written about [how much music I played in 2025](https://adactio.com/journal/22324). I’m hoping to continue that trajectory in 2026 with lots of sessions. We’re four days into the year and I’ve already had two excellent sessions. There are another three lined up this week.

One of the highlights of 2025 was [my trip with Jessica to Donegal](https://adactio.com/journal/22026). Learning Irish by day, playing in sessions by night, all while surrounded by gorgeous scenery. I’ve already got a return trip planned for 2026. I’m also planning to be back in Belfast for the annual [tradfest](https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/).

Other 2025 highlights include:

- [Curating an excellent edition of UX London](https://adactio.com/journal/21971).
- [Releasing the new Salter Cane album](https://adactio.com/journal/21680) and [playing those songs live](https://adactio.com/journal/21975)—I want to do more of that in 2026.

Most of [my travel in 2025](https://adactio.com/archive/2025/map) was either for music or family.

I made three trips to the States to see the in-laws: California, Florida, and most recently, Arizona. I can’t say I feel very comfortable going to the States right now, especially to Florida, where people openly display their intolerance on their T-shirts, and Arizona where they openly display their guns.

I went back to my hometown of Cobh a few times during the year to visit my mother.

Aside from those family trips, I went to Belfast, Donegal, Galway, and Clare in Ireland, Cáceres in Spain, Namur in Belgium, and Amsterdam. Only that last one was work-related. I always make sure to get to CSS Day.

Meanwhile here on my website, [I posted 695 times in 2025](https://adactio.com/archive/2025). That includes [345 notes](https://adactio.com/notes/archive/2025), [262 links](https://adactio.com/links/archive/2025), and [86 blog posts](https://adactio.com/journal/archive/2025). Here are some I’m quite fond of:

- [The web on mobile](https://adactio.com/journal/21728)
- [Portugeating](https://adactio.com/journal/22034)
- [Style your underlines](https://adactio.com/journal/22084)
- [Hounds Of Love](https://adactio.com/journal/22155)
- [Research](https://adactio.com/journal/22183)
- [Bóthar](https://adactio.com/journal/22228)
- [Why use React?](https://adactio.com/journal/22265)
- [Tunes and typefaces](https://adactio.com/journal/22304)

All in all, 2025 was a grand year for me. It wasn’t all that different from the year before. I’m at an age where the years aren’t all that differentiated from one another. I’m okay with that because I’m also at an age where I know what brings me joy and satisfaction, and I can focus on those things.

So here’s to 2026, which I hope I will spend doing more of what I did in 2025: playing music, speaking Irish, eating good food, hanging out with friends, reading good books, travelling to interesting places, and staying relatively healthy.

      <source:markdown>Something I like about our weird new LLM-assisted world is the number of people I know who are coding again, having mostly stopped as they moved into management roles or lost their personal side project time to becoming parents.

AI assistance means you can get something useful done in half an hour, or even while you are doing other stuff. You don&#39;t need to carve out 2-4 hours to ramp up anymore.

If you have significant previous coding experience - even if it&#39;s a few years stale - you can drive these things really effectively. Especially if you have management experience, quite a lot of which transfers to &#34;managing&#34; coding agents - communicate clearly, set achievable goals, provide all relevant context. Here&#39;s a relevant [recent tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/2007249835465072857) from Ethan Mollick:

&#62; When you see how people use Claude Code/Codex/etc it becomes clear that managing agents is really a management problem
&#62;
&#62; Can you specify goals? Can you provide context? Can you divide up tasks? Can you give feedback?

        Every culture produces heroes that reflect its deepest anxieties. The

        The Victorians, haunted by social mobility, gave us the self-made
        industrialist. And Silicon Valley, drunk on exponential curves and both
        terrified and entranced by endless funding rounds, has given us the Hero
        Developer: a figure who ships features at midnight, who “moves fast and
        breaks things,” who transforms whiteboard scribbles into billion-dollar
        unicorns through sheer caffeinated will.

        get screenshotted and shared like saintly relics.

        <p>
        Meanwhile, an unsung developer is updating dependencies, patching
        security vulnerabilities, and refactoring code that the Hero Developer
        wrote three years ago before moving on to their next “zero to one”

        Today, Ruby 4.0 was released. What an exciting milestone for the
        language!
        </p>
        <p>
        This release brings some amazing new features like the experimental
        Ruby::Box isolation mechanism, the new ZJIT compiler, significant
        performance improvements for class instantiation, and promotions of Set
        and Pathname to core classes. It’s incredible to see how Ruby continues
        to thrive and be pushed forward 30 years after its first release.
        </p>
        To celebrate this release, I’m happy to announce that I’ve been working
        on porting the Charmbracelet Go terminal libraries to Ruby, and today
        I’m releasing a first version of them. What better way to make this Ruby
        4.0 release a little more glamorous and charming?

        I remembered that people have been working towards documenting the Mac

        give it a shot and see if Apple’s Serial Test Manager could identify my
        Performa’s issue. Where was the fault on this complicated board? Sure, I
        could test a zillion traces by hand, but why bother when the computer
        already knows what is wrong?

        Cormac McCarthy, one of the greatest novelists America has ever produced
        and one of the most private, had been dead for 13 months when I arrived
        at his final residence outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was a stately
        old adobe house, two stories high with beam-ends jutting out of the
        exterior walls, set back from a country road in a valley below the
        mountains. First built in 1892, the house was expanded and modernized in
        the 1970s and extensively modified by McCarthy himself, who, it turns
        out, was a self-taught architect as well as a master of literary
        fiction.
        </p>
        I was invited to the house by two McCarthy scholars who were embroiled
        in a herculean endeavor. Working unpaid, with help from other volunteer
        scholars and occasional graduate students, they had taken it upon
        themselves to physically examine and digitally catalog every single book
        in McCarthy’s enormous and chaotically disorganized personal library.
        They were guessing it contained upwards of 20,000 volumes. By
        comparison, Ernest Hemingway, considered a voracious book collector,
        left behind a personal library of 9,000.

      <source:markdown>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.

## 🔖 [Pho\ &#38; Banh Mi Saigonese](https://www.phobanhmisaigonese.com/)

We have been at this location for over 20 years as formerly Saigonese
Restaurant. The Wheaton area has changed dramatically over time as our
customers and their preferences. Our restaurant became more and
well-known good places to enjoy Vietnamese cuisines. After serious
considerations, with kind suggestions from our customers, we rebranded
to Pho and Banh Mi Saigonese.

## 🔖 [About\ Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/about)

Standard Ebooks is a volunteer-driven effort to produce a collection of
high quality, carefully formatted, accessible, open source, and free
public domain ebooks that meet or exceed the quality of commercially
produced ebooks. The text and cover art in our ebooks are already
believed to be in the U.S. public domain, and Standard Ebooks dedicates
its own work to the public domain, thus releasing the entirety of each
ebook file into the public domain. All the ebooks we produce are
distributed free of cost and free of U.S. copyright restrictions.

## 🔖 [The Rime of the Ancient Maintainer](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-rime-of-the-ancient-maintainer/)

Every culture produces heroes that reflect its deepest anxieties. The
Greeks, terrified of both mortality and immortality, gave us Achilles.
The Victorians, haunted by social mobility, gave us the self-made
industrialist. And Silicon Valley, drunk on exponential curves and both
terrified and entranced by endless funding rounds, has given us the Hero
Developer: a figure who ships features at midnight, who “moves fast and
breaks things,” who transforms whiteboard scribbles into billion-dollar
unicorns through sheer caffeinated will.

We celebrate this person constantly. They’re on the front page of
TechCrunch et al. They keynote conferences. Their GitHub contributions
get screenshotted and shared like saintly relics.

Meanwhile, an unsung developer is updating dependencies, patching
security vulnerabilities, and refactoring code that the Hero Developer
wrote three years ago before moving on to their next “zero to one”
opportunity.

They will never be profiled in Wired.

But they’re doing something far more important than innovation.

They’re preventing collapse.

## 🔖 [One Number I Trust: Plain-Text Accounting for a Multi-Currency Household](https://lalitm.com/post/one-number-i-trust/)

No app did exactly what I needed, so I built my own personal finance
system using plain-text accounting principles and a powerful Python
library called Beancount. This post shows you how I handle imports,
investments, multi-currency, and a two-person view.

## 🔖 [Glamorous Christmas: Bringing Charm to Ruby](https://marcoroth.dev/posts/glamorous-christmas)

Today, Ruby 4.0 was released. What an exciting milestone for the
language!

This release brings some amazing new features like the experimental
Ruby::Box isolation mechanism, the new ZJIT compiler, significant
performance improvements for class instantiation, and promotions of Set
and Pathname to core classes. It’s incredible to see how Ruby continues
to thrive and be pushed forward 30 years after its first release.

To celebrate this release, I’m happy to announce that I’ve been working
on porting the Charmbracelet Go terminal libraries to Ruby, and today
I’m releasing a first version of them. What better way to make this Ruby
4.0 release a little more glamorous and charming?

## 🔖 [29 Finding a broken trace on my old Mac with the help of its ROM\ diagnostics](https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2025/12/finding-a-broken-trace-on-my-old-mac-with-the-help-of-its-rom-diagnostics/)

I remembered that people have been working towards documenting the Mac
ROM startup tests and using them to diagnose problems, so I decided to
give it a shot and see if Apple’s Serial Test Manager could identify my
Performa’s issue. Where was the fault on this complicated board? Sure, I
could test a zillion traces by hand, but why bother when the computer
already knows what is wrong?

## 🔖 [Public Domain Day 2026](https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/516)

1925 was a watershed year for the recording industry. The Jazz Age was

      <source:markdown>![Copy Files via Command Line with C++](/assets/img/cpp/xclip.jpg)

* * *

How about the convenience of copying files via the command line? You can quickly create your own command with [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp).

See the step-by-step guide below!

* * *

## Dependencies

Example for distros that use APT as the package manager

&#62; Look for corresponding names for your distro.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libx11-dev libxcb1-dev libpng-dev
```

Also compile and install [clip](https://github.com/dacap/clip)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dacap/clip
cd clip
cmake . -B build
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

* * *

## Create the Code

Example: `main.cpp`

```cpp
#include &#60;clip.h&#62;
#include &#60;fstream&#62;
#include &#60;iostream&#62;
#include &#60;sstream&#62;
#include &#60;memory&#62;

const auto use = [](){
  std::cerr &#60;&#60; &#34;Use: xclip++ &#60;file&#62; [file...]\n&#34;;
};

class Xclip {
  public:
    Xclip(int argc, char** argv){
      std::ostringstream buffer;

      for (int i = 1; i &#60; argc; ++i) {
        std::ifstream file(argv[i], std::ios::binary);
        if (!file) {
          std::cerr &#60;&#60; &#34;Error opening: &#34; &#60;&#60; argv[i] &#60;&#60; &#34;\n&#34;;
          std::exit(1);
        }

        buffer &#60;&#60; file.rdbuf();

        if(i + 1 &#60; argc){
          buffer &#60;&#60; &#39;\n&#39;;
        }
      }

      clip::set_text(buffer.str());
    }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv){
  if(argc &#60; 2){
    use();
    return 1;
  }

  auto xclip = std::make_unique&#60;Xclip&#62;(argc, argv);
}
```

* * *

## Compile and Install

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o xclip++ -lclip -lxcb -lX11 -lpng -pthread
sudo install -v xclip++ /usr/local/bin/
```

* * *

## Use Easily

```bash
xclip++ file.txt
# Or multiple files
xclip++ file1.txt file2.md file3.cpp # ...
```

* * *

This is an advantage of earlier stage companies, because you can often find aspects of all three of those in a single person, or at least across two people. In larger companies, you need three different _organizations_ doing this work together, this is just objectively hard

      <source:markdown>**[The most popular blogs of Hacker News in 2025](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/)**

Michael Lynch maintains [HN Popularity Contest](https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/), a site that tracks personal blogs on Hacker News and scores them based on how well they perform on that platform.

The engine behind the project is the [domain-meta.csv](https://github.com/mtlynch/hn-popularity-contest-data/blob/master/data/domains-meta.csv) CSV on GiHub, a hand-curated list of known personal blogs with author and bio and tag metadata, which Michael uses to separate out personal blog posts from other types of content.

I came top of the rankings in 2023, 2024 and 2025 but I&#39;m listed [in third place](https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/) for all time behind Paul Graham and Brian Krebs.

I dug around in the browser inspector and was delighted to find that the data powering the site is served with open CORS headers, which means you can easily explore it with external services like Datasette Lite.

Here&#39;s a convoluted window function query Claude Opus 4.5 [wrote for me](https://claude.ai/share/8e1cb294-0ff0-4d5b-b83f-58e4c7fdb0d2) which, for a given domain, shows where that domain ranked for each year since it first appeared in the dataset:

```
with yearly_scores as (
  select
    domain,
    strftime(&#39;%Y&#39;, date) as year,
    sum(score) as total_score,
    count(distinct date) as days_mentioned
  from &#34;hn-data&#34;
  group by domain, strftime(&#39;%Y&#39;, date)
),
ranked as (
  select
    domain,
    year,
    total_score,
    days_mentioned,
    rank() over (partition by year order by total_score desc) as rank
  from yearly_scores
)
select
  r.year,
  r.total_score,
  r.rank,
  r.days_mentioned
from ranked r
where r.domain = :domain
  and r.year &#62;= (
    select min(strftime(&#39;%Y&#39;, date))
    from &#34;hn-data&#34;
    where domain = :domain
  )
order by r.year desc
```

(I just noticed that the last `and r.year &#62;= (` clause isn&#39;t actually needed here.)

My [simonwillison.net results](https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https://hn-popularity.cdn.refactoringenglish.com/hn-data.csv#/data?sql=with+yearly_scores+as+%28%0A++select+%0A++++domain%2C%0A++++strftime%28%27%25Y%27%2C+date%29+as+year%2C%0A++++sum%28score%29+as+total_score%2C%0A++++count%28distinct+date%29+as+days_mentioned%0A++from+%22hn-data%22%0A++group+by+domain%2C+strftime%28%27%25Y%27%2C+date%29%0A%29%2C%0Aranked+as+%28%0A++select+%0A++++domain%2C%0A++++year%2C%0A++++total_score%2C%0A++++days_mentioned%2C%0A++++rank%28%29+over+%28partition+by+year+order+by+total_score+desc%29+as+rank%0A++from+yearly_scores%0A%29%0Aselect+%0A++r.year%2C%0A++r.total_score%2C%0A++r.rank%2C%0A++r.days_mentioned%0Afrom+ranked+r%0Awhere+r.domain+%3D+%3Adomain%0A++and+r.year+%3E%3D+%28%0A++++select+min%28strftime%28%27%25Y%27%2C+date%29%29+%0A++++from+%22hn-data%22%0A++++where+domain+%3D+%3Adomain%0A++%29%0Aorder+by+r.year+desc&#38;domain=simonwillison.net) show me ranked 3rd in 2022, 30th in 2021 and 85th back in 2007 - though I expect there are many personal blogs from that year which haven&#39;t yet been manually added to Michael&#39;s list.

Also useful is that every domain gets its own CORS-enabled CSV file with details of the actual Hacker News submitted from that domain, e.g. `https://hn-popularity.cdn.refactoringenglish.com/domains/simonwillison.net.csv`. Here&#39;s [that one in Datasette Lite](https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https://hn-popularity.cdn.refactoringenglish.com/domains/simonwillison.net.csv#/data/simonwillison).

        <![CDATA[<p>This is one of those times when you pay the price for working past your timeout, like a pitcher pitching too many pitches in one game.

        <p>While you're preparing to get up you decide to share a linkblog item, and when it boots up there's something severely broken. It has nothing to do with anything on your list! You roll it up for the day anyway, figuring it'll be easy to find when you start the next session. No sir. You have to work through complicated code you haven't touched in months! Where the fuck is this, and how the fuck did it happen. Drink more coffee. Keep stepping through the code to identify when things went bad. It happens in the most impossible place. You keep digging in. Even more impossible. Unfathomable. But you keep going in, making sure every bit of code does something you think it should and then boom! You left a copy in some DOM code in something you cribbed so now there are two of this thing you hadn't touched or even looked at in months. Delete the mistake, rebuild, click off all the breakpoints. And yup that was it. </p>
        <p>I started work at approx 9AM and it's 11:41AM — wasted the best part of the day, all to learn the lesson that no more "one more feature" before I get up bullshit. If you're tired you make mistakes, and you can't not pay for them. </p>
        <p>No doubt I will continue to learn this and other lessons all through what remains of my career. Some things you never learn, like "I can always roll back" — but where should I roll back to? When did I break this mofo? Oy. I'm never willing to go back that way.</p>]]>

And I like the AI response they put at the top of the page, even though I get that it's bad for the web. Maybe there's a position for a web-only search engine. One where my writing has a chance of being seen by interested parties, rather than being converted to <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=slurry">slurry</a> to be fed to consumers as one would get a <a href="https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/hot-dog-stand-new-york.html?sortBy=relevant">tasty hot dog</a> from a NYC street vendor. Another level of processing. If I recall correctly one of the browsers is saying they're not using AI at all. But this would be different, it would be for search, not the browser. </p>
        <p>But Google, if you want to be fair about it, there should be a permalink for the AI-generated answers. This is something none of the AI vendors seem to be able to do. If so, I wonder why? </p>
        <p>I just tried looking up "Regular Medicare" on Google, I was looking for an official page and ended up using the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/providers-services/original-medicare">Medicare.gov</a> one. But I could have decided the Google synopsis was the best. No way that I can see to use that as a link. </p>
        <p>Maybe we should all start thinking about how we would like the new post-AI web to work? </p>
        <p>I am trying to reach the well-known political pundits to tell them we don't have to accept the web the billionaires give us. The costs are very low, their money doesn't help them as much as you might think, because they have different concerns from the ones you (writer) and I (developer) have. I don't care about revenue (disclaimer that doesn't mean everything will be free and there won't be a business model, it just isn't the reason I'm doing the work). This is my way of giving back, the area I have the greatest leverage. I always argued that Bill Gates who kept saying in the 90s he was going to be a scrappy competitor now and give away his wealth when he retired. He <i>is</i> doing that btw, but I thought man you're never going to have the leverage you have now. Your money as a way to end famine or fight the climate crisis is nothing compared to the power you had when you had the dominant operating system in a time of great transition. You could, I argued, make the web a breakthrough for self-government, so we could <i>systematically</i> solve those problems with the resources of the United States, not just the resources of the world's richest man. That possibility really was within reach, I believed then and still do now. </p>
        <p>I made the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html">choice</a> Bill didn't and it worked. We were able to build something amazing, only to see it broken down into that slurry I mentioned at the top of the page. </p>
        <p>I love AI, I don't want to go back. But I also have big plans for human thinkers and developers -- writers, using the technology we never got a chance to develop while we were busy being dominated by Larry and Sergey, Zuckerberg, the Twitter founders, et al. </p>
        <p>As I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3mbgv3xaah22u">said</a> on Bluesky today, we're going to insist this time that the political punditry get involved, assuming they are serious about saving what's left of our democracy.</p>]]>

      <title>Good Old Medicare</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This year I switched to <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/providers-services/original-medicare">Original Medicare</a> for 2026 after being on super duper insurance industry enhanced Medicare for the first five years. I should've known that it's super duper for them but not so great for the insured person or the taxpayer, that is -- me. They have set it up so they can scam it 18 different ways, Some of the "services" they offer are just ways for them to charge the government more for your care, in return for doing absolutely nothing. </p>
        <p>So today I had my first Regular Medicare experience. I went to renew my prescriptions, and the vendor already knew my insurance info which was impressive use of computers. I was prepared to give it the new info. And in case you're confused, you still have to pay the insurance industry for Regular Medicare, even though that's actually a deal between me and my government. No way to deal them out, though I'm sure it would make total sense for us to do exactly that. Don't believe that when it comes to health care the US has been anything like a democracy.</p>
        <p>Where the old plan each prescription cost $0, this time I actually have to pay out of pocket approx $100 for a 90 day supply of five different medications. On the other hand, I'm paying much less for this insurance. I haven't done the math yet, but it feels like I'm not getting ripped off. See how many qualifiers there are.</p>
        <p>Oh the great old US of A where you can give your tax money and retirement funds to insurance companies who buy politicians etc and so on. Maybe the only thing to appreciate is that we get some health care for all our tax payments over our careers? </p>
        <p>And one good thing is now I get to keep most of my Social Security payments instead of it all going to United Healthcare. ;-)</p>]]>

We watched Condor cameras zoom in on a woman walking her dog on a bike path in suburban Atlanta; a camera followed a man walking through a Macy&#8217;s parking lot in Bakersfield; surveil children swinging on a swingset at a playground; and film high-res video of people sitting at a stoplight in traffic.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>2025 was… a year. And I made it to the end of that year. If you’re reading this, I imagine you did too and let’s celebrate that. But also not one without loss; of loved ones, of health, of relationships, of jobs, of liberties, of pursuits of happiness. Let’s mourn those.</p>
        <p>My year was mundane by most accounts. I worked, I family’d, and with the remaining life force I focused on myself. A couple failed side projects and half-baked game ideas in there but welcomingly “unproductive” relative to what I normally subject myself to. On a handful of fronts this year has been about scaling back in what I burden myself with, in material posessions, in finances, in obligations, and elsewhere. Ideally, I can clear the plate of duties that demand my limited attention. To be so bored that I read a magazine.</p>
        <h2>Resolutions resolved</h2>
        <p>I set some slightly different goals last year. Let’s check on last year’s goals:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>🟢 <strong>Seize work opportunities</strong> - I’ll call this a success. Released a design system and token system. An executive-level mandate caused us to pivot the entire design language using the tokens. Success. Other big products are beginning to use our team’s work, we’re recognized for the accessibility of our product… which is great.</li>
        <li>🔴 <strong>Hunker down and be creative</strong> - In the interest of binaries, I’ll say no. I think I gravitated to work and mind-numbing recovery, not creativity. I wasn’t very productive beyond work and family life. I think given “the situation” in the homeland, that’s okay.</li>
        <li>🟠  <strong>Slow down to 1x mode</strong> - I still watch and listen way too much in 2x but at a certain point it does feel natural. Certain content gets the 1x treatment, but not enough. I did slow down though, generally speaking. Less books, less blog posts, less side projects. And that’s okay.</li>
        <li>🔴 <strong>Join a club</strong> - I made attempts to join two different writing clubs, but it didn’t work out. One met on an inconvenient night and I guess I failed the application for the other one. I joined a Discord for a Gunpla group… but never went. Closest I got to joining a club is a dad band that plays after our kids’ band practices.</li>
        <li>🟢 <strong>Understand myself</strong> - I’m progressing on my health journey to untangle the knot of anxiety, weight, and ADHD. I’ve done all the important appointments and follow-ups. I’ve done the diet. I’ve done the exercise. I’ve got new medications all lined up. Waiting for something to change.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The school rush and kid activities fill most non-working hours. It’s a lot of work right now but we signed up for it by having children. Speaking of children, my daughter’s cheer team won a national championship, which is an incredible accomplishment and experience for her. And my son started playing guitar this year which makes the whole family happy. Both kids are 10+ now which feels like we’re entering a new era in parenting; more autonomy, different problems, deeper conversations, movies with curse words, and more attitude. It’s new territory.</p>
        <h2>An average amount of books</h2>
        <p>I had a sub-goal of reading less this year and I succeeded! That feels good.</p>

        <p>I encountered a lot of mediocre books this year but there were some bangers in there like <a href="https://amzn.to/45g0s5b">The Dawn of Everything</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3SZMflH">The Wrong Stuff</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/3YEqwTD">The Sirens’ Call</a>. It’s possible I’ve maxed out on books though. My appetite to seek out new books to read in the last two months has been super low. They’re all starting to blur into a large mush. I have a backlog of manga to read… perhaps next year is the year I get back into comics?</p>
        <h2>An average amount of blogging</h2>
        <p>I published 53 posts in 2025 which averages to a post-a-week, but there’s some hot streaks in there skewing the stats. It’s less than the year before which (again) I’ll count as a win. Behind the scenes there’s dozens of half-finished posts, but it takes so much effort to finish a technical post about CSS or web components who knows when those will see the light of day.</p>
        <p>Here’s a smattering of posts that either made the rounds or I’m proud of:</p>

        <h2>Living in the zone of shit</h2>
        <p>American politics drove a lot of my daily vibes this year. Day-after-day of bullshit executive orders, tariffs, lies, DOGE, fuckups, coverups, corruption, kidnappings, gulags, military occupation of democratic US cities under false pretenses, murders at sea, billionaires, institutional collapse, and everything else is exhausting. The economic anxiety weighed heavily on me; we even panic bought a car! But watching groceries get more expensive, budgets get tighter, all while the President and his cronies launch crypto grifts to launder money from billionaires and foreign governments in an open influence peddling scheme is infuriating.</p>
        <p>I had to step back from news a bit for my own mental health, but also it’s getting repetitive. Regime does stupid/illegal thing, PERSON gets DESTROYED by THING (but never does), consequences never happen, the world is unjust. I <em>know</em> the strategy is to exhaust, but I hit peak outrage years ago and this feels like a long, unshakable hangover of bad decisions. My trust in any form of government erodes like sand cliffs.</p>
        <p>Mix in a highly speculative tech hype cycle which makes up a disproportionate amount of the economy and stock market valuation… and it’s hard to shake off a sense of dread.</p>
        <h2>Focusing on my physical and mental health</h2>
        <p>All my extra spoons went to wrangling my physical and mental health. Sometimes that manifested as staring at an iPad on my recliner after long day at work, but it also involved a lot of doctors visits. This has been a year and a half long journey (since good healthcare kicked in) of prioritizing myself. And while the news isn’t all great, I’m getting a clearer picture of the brain and body I’m dealing with. There’s a long road ahead and I don’t actually know when/if it gets better, but having a pathway forward means a lot right now.</p>
        <p>I was unconsolably grumpy for nearly two months straight. It could be burnout. It could be cheese-moving. It could be depression manifesting differently. What I learned from going through that spell was <strong>good people and great music are the secret to being happy</strong>. At least for me. And I need to make sure I’m building that into the regular rhythms of my life.</p>
        <h2>2026: No New Projects</h2>
        <p>Next year has the potential to be good. If a certain elderly statesman, for example, passed away from age-related illnesses… that might change the mood considerably. But speaking to what’s within my sphere of control, I think there’s capacity for goodness.</p>
        <p>For 2026, I’m adopting a mantra of “No new projects.” There will be new projects of course; they fit all the interest, novelty, challenge, urgency, and passion (INCUP) requirements that motivate ADHD brains. The spirit of “No new projects” is to finish more projects than I start. In the last month or so I’ve been aggressive on closing out old lingering to-dos; home improvements, organizing, taxes, managing devices, etc. and I want to continue that work of clearing out all those nagging unfinished bits. I want to buy back precious Brain RAM so I feel less overwhelmed all the time.</p>
        <p>“No new projects” helps me be more present and realize when I’m creating work for myself. When I buy a new device, or an instrument, or think about building my own home server array… “No new projects” puts a hurdle in the way of that decision so that I don’t DDoS myself with a backlog of small jobs pursuing an impulse.</p>

      <source:markdown>2025 was… a year. And I made it to the end of that year. If you’re reading this, I imagine you did too and let’s celebrate that. But also not one without loss; of loved ones, of health, of relationships, of jobs, of liberties, of pursuits of happiness. Let’s mourn those.

My year was mundane by most accounts. I worked, I family’d, and with the remaining life force I focused on myself. A couple failed side projects and half-baked game ideas in there but welcomingly “unproductive” relative to what I normally subject myself to. On a handful of fronts this year has been about scaling back in what I burden myself with, in material posessions, in finances, in obligations, and elsewhere. Ideally, I can clear the plate of duties that demand my limited attention. To be so bored that I read a magazine.

## Resolutions resolved

I set some slightly different goals last year. Let’s check on last year’s goals:

- 🟢 **Seize work opportunities** \- I’ll call this a success. Released a design system and token system. An executive-level mandate caused us to pivot the entire design language using the tokens. Success. Other big products are beginning to use our team’s work, we’re recognized for the accessibility of our product… which is great.
- 🔴 **Hunker down and be creative** \- In the interest of binaries, I’ll say no. I think I gravitated to work and mind-numbing recovery, not creativity. I wasn’t very productive beyond work and family life. I think given “the situation” in the homeland, that’s okay.
- 🟠 **Slow down to 1x mode** \- I still watch and listen way too much in 2x but at a certain point it does feel natural. Certain content gets the 1x treatment, but not enough. I did slow down though, generally speaking. Less books, less blog posts, less side projects. And that’s okay.
- 🔴 **Join a club** \- I made attempts to join two different writing clubs, but it didn’t work out. One met on an inconvenient night and I guess I failed the application for the other one. I joined a Discord for a Gunpla group… but never went. Closest I got to joining a club is a dad band that plays after our kids’ band practices.
- 🟢 **Understand myself** \- I’m progressing on my health journey to untangle the knot of anxiety, weight, and ADHD. I’ve done all the important appointments and follow-ups. I’ve done the diet. I’ve done the exercise. I’ve got new medications all lined up. Waiting for something to change.

## A month-by-month breakdown

- **Jan**
  - New pain meds
  - New ADHD meds
- **Feb**
  - Launched internal design system
  - Shipped cross-product/platform token system
- **Mar**
  - Landscaping project
  - Trip to Arizona
  - Renaissance Faire
- **Apr**
  - Cheer competition in New Orleans
  - New car
  - 45th Birthday
- **May**
  - New ADHD meds
- **Jun**
  - Trip to Grand Canyon
- **Jul**
  - Shipped design system redesign
  - Trip to San Diego
- **Aug**
  - Back to school
- **Sept**
  - Volunteered at Austin-Oita 夏祭り
  - New BP meds
- **Oct**
  - Trip to Santa Barbara
- **Nov**
  - The Beths
  - Rainer Maria and Cap’n Jazz
  - Launched Grid-Paper
- **Dec**
  - New BP meds
  - New GLP-1 meds
  - Christmas in Nebraska

The school rush and kid activities fill most non-working hours. It’s a lot of work right now but we signed up for it by having children. Speaking of children, my daughter’s cheer team won a national championship, which is an incredible accomplishment and experience for her. And my son started playing guitar this year which makes the whole family happy. Both kids are 10+ now which feels like we’re entering a new era in parenting; more autonomy, different problems, deeper conversations, movies with curse words, and more attitude. It’s new territory.

## An average amount of books

I had a sub-goal of reading less this year and I succeeded! That feels good.

I encountered a lot of mediocre books this year but there were some bangers in there like [The Dawn of Everything](https://amzn.to/45g0s5b), [The Wrong Stuff](https://amzn.to/3SZMflH), and [The Sirens’ Call](https://amzn.to/3YEqwTD). It’s possible I’ve maxed out on books though. My appetite to seek out new books to read in the last two months has been super low. They’re all starting to blur into a large mush. I have a backlog of manga to read… perhaps next year is the year I get back into comics?

## An average amount of blogging

I published 53 posts in 2025 which averages to a post-a-week, but there’s some hot streaks in there skewing the stats. It’s less than the year before which (again) I’ll count as a win. Behind the scenes there’s dozens of half-finished posts, but it takes so much effort to finish a technical post about CSS or web components who knows when those will see the light of day.

Here’s a smattering of posts that either made the rounds or I’m proud of:

I’m sure I left something out but no need to overthink it. You can [peruse the archive](https://daverupert.com/archive/) if you want.

## Living in the zone of shit

American politics drove a lot of my daily vibes this year. Day-after-day of bullshit executive orders, tariffs, lies, DOGE, fuckups, coverups, corruption, kidnappings, gulags, military occupation of democratic US cities under false pretenses, murders at sea, billionaires, institutional collapse, and everything else is exhausting. The economic anxiety weighed heavily on me; we even panic bought a car! But watching groceries get more expensive, budgets get tighter, all while the President and his cronies launch crypto grifts to launder money from billionaires and foreign governments in an open influence peddling scheme is infuriating.

I had to step back from news a bit for my own mental health, but also it’s getting repetitive. Regime does stupid/illegal thing, PERSON gets DESTROYED by THING (but never does), consequences never happen, the world is unjust. I _know_ the strategy is to exhaust, but I hit peak outrage years ago and this feels like a long, unshakable hangover of bad decisions. My trust in any form of government erodes like sand cliffs.

Mix in a highly speculative tech hype cycle which makes up a disproportionate amount of the economy and stock market valuation… and it’s hard to shake off a sense of dread.

## Focusing on my physical and mental health

All my extra spoons went to wrangling my physical and mental health. Sometimes that manifested as staring at an iPad on my recliner after long day at work, but it also involved a lot of doctors visits. This has been a year and a half long journey (since good healthcare kicked in) of prioritizing myself. And while the news isn’t all great, I’m getting a clearer picture of the brain and body I’m dealing with. There’s a long road ahead and I don’t actually know when/if it gets better, but having a pathway forward means a lot right now.

I was unconsolably grumpy for nearly two months straight. It could be burnout. It could be cheese-moving. It could be depression manifesting differently. What I learned from going through that spell was **good people and great music are the secret to being happy**. At least for me. And I need to make sure I’m building that into the regular rhythms of my life.

## 2026: No New Projects

Next year has the potential to be good. If a certain elderly statesman, for example, passed away from age-related illnesses… that might change the mood considerably. But speaking to what’s within my sphere of control, I think there’s capacity for goodness.

For 2026, I’m adopting a mantra of “No new projects.” There will be new projects of course; they fit all the interest, novelty, challenge, urgency, and passion (INCUP) requirements that motivate ADHD brains. The spirit of “No new projects” is to finish more projects than I start. In the last month or so I’ve been aggressive on closing out old lingering to-dos; home improvements, organizing, taxes, managing devices, etc. and I want to continue that work of clearing out all those nagging unfinished bits. I want to buy back precious Brain RAM so I feel less overwhelmed all the time.

“No new projects” helps me be more present and realize when I’m creating work for myself. When I buy a new device, or an instrument, or think about building my own home server array… “No new projects” puts a hurdle in the way of that decision so that I don’t DDoS myself with a backlog of small jobs pursuing an impulse.

I tend to externalize, but 2026 also feels highly dependent on what happens in tech in the next year. A change in my job? A robot taking my job? A mass layoff? A bubble bursting? An industry collapse? A retreat to a smaller web? A new and unexpected technological breakthrough? As I hinted earlier, it feels like the entirety of tech has hitched itself to a highly speculative bet and we all have to wait and see what happens. The lack of clarity and concrete vision for the future of human-centered computing and labor creates a feeling of insecurity for me. A trillion dollar hurricane. Displacement.

But we can write. And we can dream. And we can imagine a future where humans connect.</source:markdown>
