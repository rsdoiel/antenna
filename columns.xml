      <title>Hacking the WiFi-enabled color screen GitHub Universe conference badge</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/28/github-universe-badge/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I'm at <a href="https://githubuniverse.com/">GitHub Universe</a> this week (thanks to a free ticket from Microsoft). Yesterday I picked up my conference badge... which incorporates a full Raspberry Pi with a battery, color screen, WiFi and bluetooth.</p>
        <p>GitHub Universe has a tradition of hackable conference badges - the badge last year had an eInk display. This year's is a huge upgrade though - a color screen and WiFI connection makes this thing a genuinely useful little computer!</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gitub-universe-badge.jpg" alt="Photo of the badge - it has a color screen with six app icons" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>The only thing it's missing is a keyboard - the device instead provides five buttons total - Up, Down, A, B, C. It might be possible to get a bluetooth keyboard to work though I'll believe that when I see it - there's not a lot of space on this device for a keyboard driver.</p>
        <p>Everything is written using MicroPython, and the device is designed to be hackable: connect it to a laptop with a USB-C cable and you can start modifying the code directly on the device.</p>
        <h4 id="getting-setup-with-the-badge">Getting setup with the badge</h4>
        <p>Out of the box the badge will play an opening animation (implemented as a sequence of PNG image frames) and then show a home screen with six app icons.</p>
        <p>The default apps are mostly neat Octocat-themed demos: a flappy-bird clone, a tamagotchi-style pet, a drawing app that works like an etch-a-sketch, an IR scavenger hunt for the conference venue itself (this thing has an IR sensor too!), and a gallery app showing some images.</p>
        <p>The sixth app is a badge app. This will show your GitHub profile image and some basic stats, but will only work if you dig out a USB-C cable and make some edits to the files on the badge directly.</p>
        <p>I did this on a Mac. I plugged a USB-C cable into the badge which caused MacOS to treat it as an attached drive volume. In that drive are several files including <code>secrets.py</code>. Open that up, confirm the WiFi details are correct and add your GitHub username. The file should look like this:</p>
        <pre><span class="pl-c1">WIFI_SSID</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"..."</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">WIFI_PASSWORD</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"..."</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">GITHUB_USERNAME</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"simonw"</span></pre>
        <p>The badge comes with the SSID and password for the GitHub Universe WiFi network pre-populated.</p>
        <p>That's it! Unmount the disk, hit the reboot button on the back of the badge and when it comes back up again the badge app should look something like this:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-profile.jpg" alt="Badge shows my GitHub avatar, plus 10,947 followers, 4,083 contribs, 893 repos" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <h4 id="building-your-own-apps">Building your own apps</h4>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://badger.github.io/">the official documentation</a> for building software for the badge.</p>
        <p>When I got mine yesterday the official repo had not yet been updated, so I had to figure this out myself.</p>
        <p>I copied all of the code across to my laptop, added it to a Git repo and then fired up Claude Code and told it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Investigate this code and add a detailed README</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/15773c7a53275e7836216c3aa9a8a781c06f7859/README.md">the result</a>, which was really useful for getting a start on understanding how it all worked.</p>
        <p>Each of the six default apps lives in a <code>apps/</code> folder, for example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/sketch">apps/sketch/</a> for the sketching app.</p>
        <p>There's also a menu app which powers the home screen. That lives in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/menu">apps/menu/</a>. You can edit code in here to add new apps that you create to that screen.</p>
        <p>I told Claude:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Add a new app to it available from the menu which shows network status and other useful debug info about the machine it is running on</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This was a bit of a long-shot, but it totally worked!</p>
        <p>The first version had an error:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-error.jpg" alt="A stacktrace! file badgeware.py line 510 has a list index out of range error." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>I OCRd that photo (with the Apple Photos app) and pasted the message into Claude Code and it fixed the problem.</p>
        <p>This almost worked... but the addition of a seventh icon to the 2x3 grid meant that you could select the icon but it didn't scroll into view. I had Claude <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/commit/2a60f75db101dc1dc7568ff466ad5c97dc86b336">fix that for me too</a>.</p>
        <p>Here's the code for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/main/apps/debug/__init__.py">apps/debug/__init__.py</a>, and <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?276d3e0c6566ddbc93adc7020ef6b439">the full Claude Code transcript</a> created using my terminal-to-HTML app <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/">described here</a>.</p>
        <p>Here are the four screens of the debug app:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-network.jpg" alt="Network info, showing WiFi network details and IP address" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-storage.jpg" alt="Storage screen, it has 1MB total, 72BK used. Usage 7%. CMD is /system/apps/debug" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-system.jpg" alt="System: Platform rp2, Python 1.26.0, CPU freq 200MHz, Uptime 13m46s" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-memory.jpg" alt="Memory info - 100KB used, 241KB total, and a usage bar. Press B to run GC." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <h4 id="an-icon-editor">An icon editor</h4>
        <p>The icons used on the app are 24x24 pixels. I decided it would be neat to have a web app that helps build those icons, including the ability to start by creating an icon from an emoji.</p>
        <p>I bulit this one <a href="https://claude.ai/share/ca05bd58-859e-4ceb-b5c7-7428b348df3c">using Claude Artifacts</a>. Here's the result, now available at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor">tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor</a>:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/icon-editor.jpg" alt="A stacktrace! file badgeware.py line 510 has a list index out of range error." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <h4 id="and-a-repl">And a REPL</h4>
        <p>I noticed that last year's badge configuration app (which I can't find in <a href="https://github.com/badger/badger.github.io/">github.com/badger/badger.github.io</a> any more, I think they reset the history on that repo?) worked by talking to MicroPython over the Web Serial API from Chrome. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/2004-badger.github.io/blob/e3501d631a987bfbc12d93c9e35bf2c64e55d052/public/script.js#L305-L394">my archived copy of that code</a>.</p>
        <p>Wouldn't it be useful to have a REPL in a web UI that you could use to interact with the badge directly over USB?</p>
        <p>I pointed Claude Code at a copy of that repo and told it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Based on this build a new HTML with inline JavaScript page that uses WebUSB to simply test that the connection to the badge works and then list files on that device using the same mechanism</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It took a bit of poking (here's <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?13d93a9e3b0ce1c921cd20303f2f1d84">the transcript</a>) but the result is now live at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl">tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl</a>. It only works in Chrome - you'll need to plug the badge in with a USB-C cable and then click "Connect to Badge".</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-repl.jpg" alt="Badge Interactive REPL. Note: This tool requires the Web Serial API (Chrome/Edge on desktop).

      </description>
      <source:markdown>I&#39;m at [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) this week (thanks to a free ticket from Microsoft). Yesterday I picked up my conference badge... which incorporates a full Raspberry Pi with a battery, color screen, WiFi and bluetooth.

GitHub Universe has a tradition of hackable conference badges - the badge last year had an eInk display. This year&#39;s is a huge upgrade though - a color screen and WiFI connection makes this thing a genuinely useful little computer!

![Photo of the badge - it has a color screen with six app icons](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gitub-universe-badge.jpg)

The only thing it&#39;s missing is a keyboard - the device instead provides five buttons total - Up, Down, A, B, C. It might be possible to get a bluetooth keyboard to work though I&#39;ll believe that when I see it - there&#39;s not a lot of space on this device for a keyboard driver.

Everything is written using MicroPython, and the device is designed to be hackable: connect it to a laptop with a USB-C cable and you can start modifying the code directly on the device.

#### Getting setup with the badge

Out of the box the badge will play an opening animation (implemented as a sequence of PNG image frames) and then show a home screen with six app icons.

The default apps are mostly neat Octocat-themed demos: a flappy-bird clone, a tamagotchi-style pet, a drawing app that works like an etch-a-sketch, an IR scavenger hunt for the conference venue itself (this thing has an IR sensor too!), and a gallery app showing some images.

The sixth app is a badge app. This will show your GitHub profile image and some basic stats, but will only work if you dig out a USB-C cable and make some edits to the files on the badge directly.

I did this on a Mac. I plugged a USB-C cable into the badge which caused MacOS to treat it as an attached drive volume. In that drive are several files including `secrets.py`. Open that up, confirm the WiFi details are correct and add your GitHub username. The file should look like this:

```
WIFI_SSID = &#34;...&#34;
WIFI_PASSWORD = &#34;...&#34;
GITHUB_USERNAME = &#34;simonw&#34;
```

The badge comes with the SSID and password for the GitHub Universe WiFi network pre-populated.

That&#39;s it! Unmount the disk, hit the reboot button on the back of the badge and when it comes back up again the badge app should look something like this:

![Badge shows my GitHub avatar, plus 10,947 followers, 4,083 contribs, 893 repos](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-profile.jpg)

#### Building your own apps

Here&#39;s [the official documentation](https://badger.github.io/) for building software for the badge.

When I got mine yesterday the official repo had not yet been updated, so I had to figure this out myself.

I copied all of the code across to my laptop, added it to a Git repo and then fired up Claude Code and told it:

&#62; `Investigate this code and add a detailed README`

Here&#39;s [the result](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/15773c7a53275e7836216c3aa9a8a781c06f7859/README.md), which was really useful for getting a start on understanding how it all worked.

Each of the six default apps lives in a `apps/` folder, for example [apps/sketch/](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/sketch) for the sketching app.

There&#39;s also a menu app which powers the home screen. That lives in [apps/menu/](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/menu). You can edit code in here to add new apps that you create to that screen.

I told Claude:

&#62; `Add a new app to it available from the menu which shows network status and other useful debug info about the machine it is running on`

This was a bit of a long-shot, but it totally worked!

The first version had an error:

![A stacktrace! file badgeware.py line 510 has a list index out of range error.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-error.jpg)

I OCRd that photo (with the Apple Photos app) and pasted the message into Claude Code and it fixed the problem.

This almost worked... but the addition of a seventh icon to the 2x3 grid meant that you could select the icon but it didn&#39;t scroll into view. I had Claude [fix that for me too](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/commit/2a60f75db101dc1dc7568ff466ad5c97dc86b336).

Here&#39;s the code for [apps/debug/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/main/apps/debug/__init__.py), and [the full Claude Code transcript](https://gistpreview.github.io/?276d3e0c6566ddbc93adc7020ef6b439) created using my terminal-to-HTML app [described here](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/).

Here are the four screens of the debug app:

![Network info, showing WiFi network details and IP address](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-network.jpg)

![Storage screen, it has 1MB total, 72BK used. Usage 7%. CMD is /system/apps/debug](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-storage.jpg)

![System: Platform rp2, Python 1.26.0, CPU freq 200MHz, Uptime 13m46s](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-system.jpg)

![Memory info - 100KB used, 241KB total, and a usage bar. Press B to run GC.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-memory.jpg)

#### An icon editor

The icons used on the app are 24x24 pixels. I decided it would be neat to have a web app that helps build those icons, including the ability to start by creating an icon from an emoji.

I bulit this one [using Claude Artifacts](https://claude.ai/share/ca05bd58-859e-4ceb-b5c7-7428b348df3c). Here&#39;s the result, now available at [tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor](https://tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor):

![A stacktrace! file badgeware.py line 510 has a list index out of range error.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/icon-editor.jpg)

#### And a REPL

I noticed that last year&#39;s badge configuration app (which I can&#39;t find in [github.com/badger/badger.github.io](https://github.com/badger/badger.github.io/) any more, I think they reset the history on that repo?) worked by talking to MicroPython over the Web Serial API from Chrome. Here&#39;s [my archived copy of that code](https://github.com/simonw/2004-badger.github.io/blob/e3501d631a987bfbc12d93c9e35bf2c64e55d052/public/script.js#L305-L394).

Wouldn&#39;t it be useful to have a REPL in a web UI that you could use to interact with the badge directly over USB?

I pointed Claude Code at a copy of that repo and told it:

&#62; `Based on this build a new HTML with inline JavaScript page that uses WebUSB to simply test that the connection to the badge works and then list files on that device using the same mechanism`

It took a bit of poking (here&#39;s [the transcript](https://gistpreview.github.io/?13d93a9e3b0ce1c921cd20303f2f1d84)) but the result is now live at [tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl](https://tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl). It only works in Chrome - you&#39;ll need to plug the badge in with a USB-C cable and then click &#34;Connect to Badge&#34;.

![Badge Interactive REPL. Note: This tool requires the Web Serial API (Chrome/Edge on desktop). Connect to Badge, Disconnect and Clear Terminal buttons. Then a REPL interface displaying: Ready to connect.

#### Get hacking

If you&#39;re a GitHub Universe attendee I hope this is useful. The official [badger.github.io](https://badger.github.io/) site has plenty more details to help you get started.

There isn&#39;t yet a way to get hold of this hardware outside of GitHub Universe - I know they had some supply chain challenges just getting enough badges for the conference attendees!

It&#39;s a very neat device, built for GitHub by [Pimoroni](https://www.pimoroni.com/) in Sheffield, UK. A version of this should become generally available in the future under the name &#34;Pimoroni Tufty 2350&#34;.

&#62; 1. Atlas substitutes its own AI-generated content for the web, but it looks like it’s showing you the web
&#62; 2. The user experience makes you guess what commands to type instead of clicking on links
&#62; 3. You’re the agent for the browser, it’s not being an agent for you
&#62;
&#62; It’s very clear that a lot of the new AI era is about dismantling the web’s original design.

Trends in the `immameco` question.

Release 2 of the 2024 GSS cross-section and 1972-2024 culumative data are [now available](https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data.html). I’ve updated [`gssr`](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/) and [`gssrdoc`](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/) to incorporate them. There are quite a few changes in the data and variables, thanks in part to some changes in data collection methods and a privacy/disclosure review.

        For more than a decade Backblaze has been providing an important public service by publishing data on the reliability of their hard drives, and more recently their SSDs. Below the fold I comment on this month's post from their Drive Stats Team, <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/are-hard-drives-getting-better-lets-revisit-the-bathtub-curve/"><i>Are Hard Drives Getting Better? Let’s Revisit the Bathtub Curve</i></a>.<br />
        <br />
        Wikipedia defines the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub_curve">Bathtub Curve</a> as a common concept in reliability engineering:<br />
        <blockquote>
        The 'bathtub' refers to the shape of a line that curves up at both ends, similar in shape to a bathtub. The bathtub curve has 3 regions:<br />
        <ol>
        <li>The first region has a decreasing failure rate due to early failures.</li>
        <li>The middle region is a constant failure rate due to random failures.</li>
        <li>The last region is an increasing failure rate due to wear-out failures.</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <span><a name='more'></a></span>
        <br />
        In 2017's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/10/storage-failures-in-field.html"><i>Storage Failures In The Field</i></a> I commented on Backblaze's observation that the 10TB and 12TB HDD generations showed much reduced infant mortality:<br />
        <blockquote>
        devoting engineering effort to reducing infant mortality can have a significant return on investment. A drive that fails early will be returned under warranty, costing the company money. A drive that fails after the warranty expires cannot be returned. Warranty costs must be reserved against in the company's accounts. Any reduction in the rate of early failures goes straight to the company's bottom line.
        </blockquote>
        Enterprise disks are typically warranted for 5 years, so a disk manufacturer is incentized to focus engineering effort on eliminating the "first region", the left side of the bathtub, and ensuring that the second region extends past the 5 year mark. Eight years ago Backblaze was starting to see that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/big-hard-disks-may-be-breaking-the-bathtub-curve/">engineers were succeeding in the first region</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        While the data so far is very limited, with 1,240 disks and 14,220 aggregate drive days accumulated so far, none of these disks (both Seagate models) have failed. The low level of usage means that the disks have been installed and formatted and not much beyond that, but true infant mortality—disks that immediately expire on their first use—hasn’t become apparent.

        Four years later in <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/drive-failure-over-time-the-bathtub-curve-is-leaking/"><i>Drive Failure Over Time: The Bathtub Curve Is Leaking</i></a> Klein had some much stronger evidence:<br />
        <blockquote>
        The left side of the bathtub, the area of “decreasing failure rate,” is dramatically lower in 2021 than in 2013. In fact, for our 2021 curve, there is almost no left side of the bathtub, making it hard to take a bath, to say the least. We have reported how <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-to-build-a-hard-drive-a-factory-tour/">Seagate breaks in and tests their newly manufactured hard drives</a> before shipping in an effort to lower the failure rates of their drives. Assuming all manufacturers do the same, that may explain some or all of this observation.
        </blockquote>
        Note that the engineers hadn't quite succeeded in the second region, as the 2021 failure rate for years 4 and 5 was noticeably higher than for younger drives. But they had succeeded in pushing the major increase in failures out beyond 5.5 years. Everything before that was less than 4% Annual Failure Rate (AFR).<br />

        Another four years later in the current graph things have changed quite a bit:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>For the first 5 years the AFR is under 2%.</li>
        <li>For the first 5 years the AFR gradually increases, the first region has been completely eliminated.</li>

        Backblaze's final graph puts all three sets of data in one graph and shows a dramatic improvement in drive longevity:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>Drives in 2013 were dramatically less reliable than in later years, both because their AFRs were consistently higher and because their AFR hit 13% after 3 years.</li>
        <li>By 2021 the engineers had kept the AFR around 2% through the warranty, but the drives wore out rapidly in the 7th year.</li>
        <li>Now, the drives are only showing signs of beginning to wear out at 10.5 years.</li>
        </ul>
        That is some serious engineering at the long end! And at the short end <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/are-hard-drives-getting-better-lets-revisit-the-bathtub-curve/">things are great</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        we see that the drive failure rates on the front end of the curve are also incredibly low—when a drive is between zero and one years old, we barely crack 1.30% AFR.
        </blockquote>
        The left side of the bathtub is really gone, improving the manufacturers' margins. But if I eyeball the 2025 graph's first 20 quarters I estimate the AFR averages 1.6%, which implies that over the 5-year warranty 8% of the drives failed. Clearly, the engineers still have work to do.<br />

Backblaze&#39;s final graph puts all three sets of data in one graph and shows a dramatic improvement in drive longevity:

- Drives in 2013 were dramatically less reliable than in later years, both because their AFRs were consistently higher and because their AFR hit 13% after 3 years.
- By 2021 the engineers had kept the AFR around 2% through the warranty, but the drives wore out rapidly in the 7th year.
- Now, the drives are only showing signs of beginning to wear out at 10.5 years.

That is some serious engineering at the long end! And at the short end [things are great](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/are-hard-drives-getting-better-lets-revisit-the-bathtub-curve/):

&#62; we see that the drive failure rates on the front end of the curve are also incredibly low—when a drive is between zero and one years old, we barely crack 1.30% AFR.

The left side of the bathtub is really gone, improving the manufacturers&#39; margins. But if I eyeball the 2025 graph&#39;s first 20 quarters I estimate the AFR averages 1.6%, which implies that over the 5-year warranty 8% of the drives failed. Clearly, the engineers still have work to do.

&#62;
&#62; It&#39;s the work that I don&#39;t know how to do and would have to research. Or the grunge work I don&#39;t even want to do. On this it is hard to even put a number on. Many of the projects I do with Claude day to day I just wouldn&#39;t have done at all pre-Claude.

      <source:markdown>**[The PSF has withdrawn a $1.5 million proposal to US government grant program](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html)**

The Python Software Foundation was recently &#34;recommended for funding&#34; (NSF terminology) for a $1.5m grant from the US government National Science Foundation to help improve the security of the Python software ecosystem, after an grant application process lead by Seth Larson and Loren Crary.

The PSF&#39;s annual budget is less than $6m so this is a meaningful amount of money for the organization!

We were forced to withdraw our application and turn down the funding, thanks to new language that was added to the agreement requiring us to affirm that we &#34;do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.&#34;

Our legal advisors confirmed that this would not just apply to security work covered by the grant - this would apply to all of the PSF&#39;s activities.

This was not an option for us. Here&#39;s the [mission](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/) of the PSF:

&#62; The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

If we accepted and spent the money despite this term, there was a very real risk that the money could be clawed back later. That represents an existential risk for the foundation since we would have already spent the money!

I was one of the board members who voted to reject this funding - a unanimous but tough decision. I’m proud to serve on a board that can make difficult decisions like this.

If you&#39;d like to sponsor the PSF you can find out more [on our site](https://www.python.org/sponsors/application/). I&#39;d love to see a few more of the large AI labs show up [on our top-tier visionary sponsors list](https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/).

        <p><strong>2025-10-04</strong>. The first day we went for a walk from Estoril to
        Cascais with my stepmom and her sister.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XARZJWQCH73Y5HMDWBT9BX.jpeg" alt="Me, my stepmom, my wife, and my stepmom’s sister, all with sunglasses and grinning into the camera, with the bright sky and the blue ocean in our back." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-04</strong>. The second day we went to Ericeira with my mom and two
        of her friends, watching the ocean and then going to eat seafood. Very
        nice.</p>
        
        <video src="2025-portugal/01K6XANNZXC6XX39NC8C6A6DXA.mp4" poster="/wiki/2025-portugal/01K6XANNZXC6XX39NC8C6A6DXA.jpeg" alt="Waves are crashing into the rocky shore.

        <p><strong>2025-10-06</strong>. On the third day we went to see Sintra. So many
        people! So many cars. So little parking.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XB7K0TPPGNYBHYJAYPS8A3.jpeg" alt="My wife and my stepmom in front of a wine bar." />

        <p><strong>2025-10-07</strong>. We ended the fourth day at
        <a href="https://www.asevera.com/en/fado-restaurant/">Severa</a>, one of the Fado
        places in Lisbon. I usually go to Clube do Fado but my stepmother
        knows the places to go and Faia had no tables left.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-08</strong>. On the fifth day we went to in Palmela, an old
        fortress town north of Setúbal. The view is great. From now on it&rsquo;s
        just the two of us.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7261CQX4B6SFETX2MMH9WJP.jpeg" alt="Driving over a long bridge. The concrete looks like a big H with “rays” of metal streaming towards us." />

        <p>The region is famous for Muscatel wine. We tasted some and it was great. And
        we had some dried sheep cheese, a very soft cheese from Azeitão, pumpkin jam
        and bread. Super tasty. And we didn’t even have dinner.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K72EGE70C2GZ5HGJKWAVTZ8M.jpeg" alt="The old town and a park and the hill with the old fortress at the top." />

        <p><strong>2025-10-09</strong>. We went towards the Cape Espiche and walked to an old
        ruin and back. Perfect weather. This is the area west of Sesimbra in
        the Serra d’Arrábida.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K74Z8YCCCPSCMETHZVVFS8DX.jpeg" alt="A dirt road loading towards the coastline." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K74Z90NE4GC7K5Z9SAGFJGYQ.jpeg" alt="Up here the grass is very dry. Some dry thistles in the foreground." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K74Z93CCNW0TY1BDSD95QEHV.jpeg" alt="The small strip of coast that drops off towards the ocean is green. It looks like a 30 degree angle, and then a steep drop." />

        <p>I had never seen a praying mantis before. This one was moving very
        slowly on the dirt path.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K76MY6D1NGD9JSSVKXWFJDQ3.jpeg" alt="A green insect on red dust, a bit like a grasshopper, but the back legs are very thin and the front legs are huge." /></p>
        
        <p>At the Cabo Espichel there was a closed church and a ruined building
        that looked like a two storey hostel with windows walled shut. It
        looked depressing and I did not take any pictures. I preferred looking
        at the coastline and the sea.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-1.jpg" alt="The steep coastline at Cabo Espichel where the flat land drops into the sea below." /></p>
        
        <p>On the way back we stopped in Sesimbra, had coffee and watched people
        walk by. A perfect way to chill out before returning to the hotel.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-2.jpg" alt="Claudia and I drinking coffee. A galão is usually a morning drink: a glass of milk with a shot of espresso and no milk foam, unlike a latte macchiato." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-10</strong>. Today we drove to Évora and on the way we stopped at
        Alcácer do Sal. The region produces a third of Portugal’s rice,
        apparently.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K781V8AD2Y94CRYNXYFY5KXG.jpeg" alt="From across the river, the old town with white houses and tiled roofs plus a church with two towers." />

        <p>We stopped at Nossa Senhora de Guadelupe for the standing stones.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782P816RC9JBSEDDGN8ZKG3.jpeg" alt="Rounded standing stones. Nearly one hundred of them." />

        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782QBQFMM6KZ7B95AZ5PBHG.jpeg" alt="A standing stone, many metres tall." /></p>
        
        <p>We reached Évora.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782Z4FA53GJHZ7DYH1HJ1TG.jpeg" alt="A ruin of a Roman temple in the middle of a Portuguese town." />

        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782ZNF8JXS7WGSH26MJYKC9.jpeg" alt="A view of Évora from a slightly elevated position. The buildings are white, with yellow highlight at the ground level and the corners, two stories high, with tiled roofs. The cobble-stone roads are narrow." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-11</strong>. Seeing so many martyrs dying, so many tortured Jesus
        sculptures, so many golden dresses, fancy hats, silver and gold, I am
        sick and tired of churches.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A4G59DCX13SCNMSR78K2HX.jpeg" alt="The ceiling is white, the walls above gold encrusted and full of paintings, the the walls below are made of blue and white ceramic tiles." />

        <p>Coffee culture is very much to my liking. I also like the ceramic
        tiles, I guess. Very cool in summer and very different from what I see
        in Switzerland.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A4WGQRV6GT2S5PPXRJK6ZG.jpeg" alt="The backstreets of Évora with white walls, yellow color accents, and cobblestone roads." />

        <p>They say that the Marquês de Pombal closed the university after two
        hundred years to kick the religious orders including the Jesuits out
        of Portugal in order to end the Inquisition. That doesn&rsquo;t sound so
        bad. He also helped out when the big earthquake struck in 1755. But
        when you read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_de_Carvalho_e_Melo,_1st_Marquis_of_Pombal">Wikipedia
        page</a>,
        a different man emerges. Optimizing the slave trade, for example.
        Uuuuugh.</p>
        
        <p>I feel like “no war but class war” would apply to him, too. I lived in
        Oeiras as a kid in the eighties and remember a part of his estate
        still exists.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-12</strong>. We went on a long drive around the reservoir behind
        the Alqueva Dam. It has a catchment area of 250 km² – it was filled in
        2003, long after I had left Portugal, so it was all new to me. We
        visited Monsaraz, first.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7CSE04TCGQHVK6KN2MK6TX3.jpeg" alt="Looking from old fortifications towards the lake." />

        <p>We went to Mourão, next. The town is small, the fortress is crumbling.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D1X666H3SVQNFPB900V6B5.jpeg" alt="The dry grass with the occasional olive tree and a huge water reservoir in the back." />

        <p>By that time we were hungry and in the middle of sleepy Mourão we found a
        little park with a coffee stand where we had queijadas, café (espresso), galão
        (espresso with a lot of milk) and a small bottle of Pedras Salgadas (salty
        sparkling mineral water).</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D23NCRTBQ10Q88E26JNQ2Y.jpeg" alt="Me, on the main square, with the park in my back." />

        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D23YSY95DQS28Z6K7DGQWE.jpeg" alt="Me, drinking coffee." /></p>
        
        <p>We crossed the Alqueda Dam and went for a small walk.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D2CDQ0EC6499AC14E14P73.jpeg" alt="The lake, seen from the dam. It’s big." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D2CGJJHSBA48VMFQQNB0RR.jpeg" alt="The dam infrastructure behind the dam. It’s big. There are emergency overflows and electrical things. Not shown is the gazillion doves nesting here." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D2CJAR1EPAT8Y1CR83Y7HN.jpeg" alt="The river downstream from the dam is wide and quiet. It’s big, too. Like a lake." /></p>
        
        <p>And finally, we went for a small walk from Alqueda to a side arm of the lake.
        There, I saw a water snake, a gazillion fish, a hare, several herons (big grey
        ones and smaller white ones), and then, suddenly, at the bend in the distance,
        a commotion. The water was wild. We saw three or for cormorants, hunting. And
        then, after moving slowly along the shore, they took flight. Claudia started
        counting and got to 25! So the three or four we saw where the ones on the
        surface and the madness in the water was the remaining twenty cormorants.
        Amazing.</p>

        <p><strong>2025-10-13</strong>. We drove from Évora to Estremoz. Our first two stops
        were Redondo and Vila Viçosa. Apparently the region between Vila
        Viçosa and Estremos has had marble quarries since Roman times and the
        region is still the second largest European marble export after
        Carrara in Italy. Or so it says in our tourist guide. A paper book! It
        must be true. They have so much marble that they use it for sidewalks
        and road signs, set into the cobblestone streets.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7HF42DTD6KXZ9CYHQ4H5GN4.jpeg" alt="Typical one and two story houses, chalked white, with yellow or blue accents. The one on the right is Porfirio’s restaurant (closed)." />

        <p>Sadly, Estremoz is also a throwback to older times: wild dogs
        defending their territory. Wild cats and their young being fed in the
        street. Chained dogs barking and howling with fear and rage and
        torment. Bull fighting arenas. They don’t kill the bulls, they just
        torment them. And everywhere, ruins. Ruined industries. Ruined
        buildings.</p>
        
        <p>These pictures are from Vila Viçosa, Borba and Estremoz.</p>

        <p>We didn’t go on a tour into the marble quarries but we went jogging
        and took some pictures from the street. There are no easy access
        points. Everything is fenced off.</p>

        <p>The Portuguese are very discrete. Their front entrances don’t have
        names. Their doorbells don’t have names. Their mailboxes don’t have
        names. Your letter might say for whom it is, in what village, street,
        number, floor, left or right – but the name is optional since the post
        people won’t be able to check. When they answer the phone, they just
        say “I’m here” but they don’t say their name. If you ask, it’s rude.
        The caller is supposed to state their name and who they’re trying to
        reach. This used to be very confusing for me and my family because in
        German-speaking phone culture the person picking up the phone says who
        they are, then the caller says who they are, and then the conversation
        proceeds.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes I wonder whether such privacy-consciousness is a consequence
        of having lived through a dictatorship.</p>
        
        <p>The view of a corporatist state (super into unions and against
        parties) who is opposed to both communism and liberalism is super
        interesting, if you want to know more:

        <p><strong>2025-10-14</strong>. Some more impressions of the fortifications – and
        here, too, a throwback to the eighties: people just dumping garbage
        over the wall.</p>

        <p><strong>2025-10-15</strong>. Today we were in Elvas. Without a drone, we couldn’t
        take any pictures from above. But we walked a lot. 😄 I’m skipping all
        the interior rooms, bunker-like tunnels and the nationalist and
        pro-army messages from 1959 on the walls.</p>

        <p><strong>2025-10-16</strong>. We drove to Marvão, another fortress town on the
        Portuguese side of the border.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>“The Portugal–Spain border, also referred to as &ldquo;the Stripe&rdquo;, is one of the
        oldest geopolitical borders in the world. The current demarcation is almost
        identical to that defined in 1297 by the Treaty of Alcañices.”
        &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal%E2%80%93Spain_border">Wikipedia</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>(This is not the Treaty of Tordesillas that divided up the globe.)</p>
        
        <p>Personally the most amazing thing is that there are Eurasian griffon vultures
        (Gyps fulvus) nesting in the cliff below. No phone pictures of these, however.</p>

        below.</p>

        <p>We went on a long walk from Marvão to Castelo de Vide via Carreiras. I took a
        lot of pictures of the road. Often, we were walking on a medieval road.</p>

        <p>As we approached the end of the hike, we descended a slope that must have
        burned not so long ago.</p>

        <p><strong>2025-10-17</strong>. Today we went on a 60km drive to see the gap where the
        Tejo river breaks through the mountains to continue its journey to
        Lisbon. These are the Portas de Ródão. Not quite the Gates of Rohan,
        but close. 😂</p>
        
        <p>The paper industry loves Eucalyptus trees and the summer forest fires
        do, too. As a kid I was surprised to learn that the eucalyptus tree is
        not a Portuguese native! So now we imported both: the trees, and the
        forest fires.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7WARZRTAC9X3XY01CE09SD0.jpeg" alt="When we left the village, the dirt road lead through dry meadows and light eucalyptus forests." /></p>
        
        <p>I feel that we’ll see more water reservoirs in central Europe as the
        climate heats up. Unless the North Atlantic Gulf Stream breaks down in
        which case we’ll get Canadian weather. Ugh!</p>

        <p>We got to the top of the Serra de São Miguel and walked towards the gap.</p>

        <p>What did impress us to no end, however, were the forty Eurasian
        griffon vultures we saw circling above us; the countless young we saw
        in the rock face; the adults coming and going. Such impressive birds.</p>
        
        <p>6s of vultures circling above.</p>

        <p>Our walk wasn&rsquo;t over, however. It was a long way back along the river and up another chain of hills.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-78.jpg" alt="I&rsquo;m walking in a light forest on a rough track." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-19</strong>. We left Portugal&rsquo;s east and drove towards Leiria.
        We&rsquo;re staying in Alvados near Porto de Mós, hoping to do some hiking
        in the Serras de Aire e Candeeiros Nature Park. It&rsquo;s near Fátima, if
        you know your way around famous pilgrimage destinations.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-3.jpg" alt="The view from our hotel window shows a wilderness trees and shrubs and a hill in the distance," /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-20</strong>. We went on the Fórnea walk: First along the foot of
        the hill through some olive groves, then into a valley where a
        waterfall shows up on rainy days, and finally onto the hill itself, to
        see the plateau, and back down.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-73.jpg" alt="Claudia and I are ready to go, wearing sunglasses and grinning." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-4.jpg" alt="A dirt road winds itself through shrubland towards the hills in the distance." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-5.jpg" alt="The grass is dry, the thistles brown." /></p>
        
        <p>The olive trees are small so that the olives can be harvested without
        ladders. We saw a few farmers &ndash; often a man and a woman &ndash; cutting
        branches and stripping olives over a big net they had spread beneath
        the tree.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-6.jpg" alt="Small olive trees to the left and right of the dirt road." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-7.jpg" alt="The trail turns towards the mountains. It&rsquo;s aiming for a gap." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-8.jpg" alt="The waterfall is try. All we can see is a rock layer breaking through the hill side." /></p>
        
        <p>This is karst, where water disappears into underground caverns and the
        surface world is dry. But here, in this valley surrounded by hills,
        there is enough humidity to allow some lushness.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-9.jpg" alt="The trail is narrow and greenery rises on both sides." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-10.jpg" alt="The sky is overcast and Claudia and I are no longer wearing our sunglasses." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-11.jpg" alt="The dirt road continues and begins to rise in the distance." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-12.jpg" alt="We&rsquo;re further up now, looking back at the olive groves below." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-13.jpg" alt="The autumn crokus growing out of the ground without leaves, just a flower on a short stalk, continues to amaze me." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-14.jpg" alt="The plateau at the top of the hill features a gazillion little meadows, each surrounded by a dry stone wall." /></p>
        
        <p>The plateau up here is very humid. Is it the altitude? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
        
        <p>We also saws four dead fire salamanders. Huge ones! Apparently, the
        Portuguese fire salamanders are suffering from a fungus that damages
        their skin and kills them within a week or two. Was this the reason?
        The animals did not seem run over by a car or eaten by a carnivore.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-15.jpg" alt="Our trail led around the back of the hill top." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-16.jpg" alt="And finally, the view into the natural amphitheatre." /></p>
        
        <p>I keep thinking about the enclosures.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-17.jpg" alt="The sun is back and so are our sunglasses. We&rsquo;re still on the plateau with the green meadows and the dry stone walls." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-76.jpg" alt="The trail doesn&rsquo;t cross any meadows. It always goes between two walls separating these meadows." /></p>
        
        <p>Down there somewhere is the green valley we had seen before.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-18.jpg" alt="Claudia and our goal in the valley below." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-19.jpg" alt="Claudia" /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-21</strong>. We went to see some Dinosaur foot steps, Fátima and Batalha.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-20.jpg" alt="The dinosaur footsteps are in a plain of limestone that used to be the bottom of an old quarry." /></p>
        
        <p>The very nice and knowledgeable person who let us in during lunch
        break explained that the scientists had washed the depressions of the
        sauropod footsteps in order to make them more visible. The just
        cleaned the limestone of algae and lichen.</p>
        
        <p>They had also errected a wooden walkway above the limestone to protect
        the sauropod footsteps from humans. Unfortunately, the wood used had
        unexpectedly leaked fungicides and other toxins, killing off the
        lichen and algae growing on the limestone. The effect is that it looks
        just as whitewashed as the actual footstops the scientists had washed.
        It&rsquo;ll take fix or six years to grow back, we were told.</p>
        
        <p>The footsteps above the walkway are easy to spot, though.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-21.jpg" alt="Seen from above, we can see how the grey limestone is in fact washed white below a wooden footbridge, as if the wood had leaked white colour onto the grey limestone." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-23.jpg" alt="In black and white the footsteps above the walkway are pretty easy to see." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-22.jpg" alt="Claudia and I on the walkway, in black and white, grinning." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-24.jpg" alt="The limestone comes in layers that are easy to spot as they look like irregular stairs." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-25.jpg" alt="The limestone forms a karst landscape where the water disappears into the underworld. Here we see a hole in the limestone that looks like the beginning of a cave!" />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-26.jpg" alt="Looking away from the limestone for a moment, we see the landscape around the hill we&rsquo;re on. Shrubs, trees, meadows in the distance." /></p>
        
        <p>Fátima is an important pilgrimage destination for Catholics in Europe,
        like Lourdes in France or Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The square
        is huge. The church is huge. There are chapels underground. Some
        pilgrims do the last part of their pilgrimage on their knees.</p>
        
        <p>It drives tears to my eyes to see grown men and women debase
        themselves like that, in the rain, on the cold, hard stone, in 2025.
        It&rsquo;s revolting to see the prayer at the beginning of this passage say:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Most Holy Trinity<br>
        Father, Son and Holy Spirit,<br>
        I adore you profoundly.</p>
        
        <p>My heart rejoices<br>
        For the many blessings<br>
        You have bestowed upon me.<br>
        Accept this pilgrimage on my knees …</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>It&rsquo;s heart wrenching to see how these people believe, to imagine the
        torment and fear that brought them to this place, and to think that
        the church felt this was the best way to help them.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalha_Monastery">Monastery of Batalha</a>
        was erected in commemoration of the 1385 Battle of Aljubarrota where

        French allies as well as their Genoese mercenaries.</p>

        <p><strong>2025-10-22</strong>. We drove to our last hotel in A-dos-Cunhados, near the
        beach. On the way we stopped in Nazaré and Peniche, hoping to see some
        waves.</p>
        
        <p>I was hoping, against all odds, that we&rsquo;d see those 30m high waves in
        Nazaré. Sadly, no such luck.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-54.jpg" alt="I&rsquo;m standing in front of the famous lighthouse from where people stare at the high waves, if there are any. I&rsquo;m cold. There are some tourists, here." />

        <p>Peniche is another surfer hotspot but the waves where not impressive.</p>

        <p>We arrived at our hotel near Santa Cruz and discovered that there was a footpath to the beach!</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-58.jpg" alt="Claudia is walking through the hotel gardens." />

        <p><strong>2025-10-23</strong>. We met my mom in Mafra, saw the royal summer palace,
        built by 45,000 people over 13 years (including a lot of forced
        labour) and then it was only used for a few years. Royalty is misery.</p>

      <source:markdown># Portugal 2025

We spent three weeks in Portugal.

I thought October was great since the main season ends mid September.
But there are still a lot of people in the Lisbon region!

[#Portugal](/search/?q=%23Portugal) [#Pictures](/search/?q=%23Pictures)

**2025-10-04**. The first day we went for a walk from Estoril to
Cascais with my stepmom and her sister.

![Me, my stepmom, my wife, and my stepmom’s sister, all with sunglasses and grinning into the camera, with the bright sky and the blue ocean in our back.](2025-portugal/01K6XARZJWQCH73Y5HMDWBT9BX.jpeg)

**2025-10-04**. The second day we went to Ericeira with my mom and two
of her friends, watching the ocean and then going to eat seafood. Very
nice.

![The beach of Ericeira, protected by a long arm of rock and concrete, with a beach that’s very empty, with fishing boats and boxes and cages all pilled high behind the beach, a 10m cliff (or more) and houses above.](2025-portugal/01K6XAS0D7MHFTF4CWX6S3RZK5.jpeg)![A picture from the foot of the cliff where big chunks have fallen from above and white houses lean precariously close to the edge above.](2025-portugal/01K6XAS2EG6QDDE7PVJCQ16VET.jpeg)![The view from above where my wife and I are waving, if you zoom in far enough.](2025-portugal/01K6XAS4S7SQC8P3SWHZX98KGP.jpeg)

**2025-10-06**. On the third day we went to see Sintra. So many
people! So many cars. So little parking.

![My wife and my stepmom in front of a wine bar.](2025-portugal/01K6XB7K0TPPGNYBHYJAYPS8A3.jpeg)![Looking at a forested hill with a castle wall at the top.](2025-portugal/01K6XB7N2P769PECS4JD2DW341.jpeg)![A few houses and a church from above, with lots of green trees.](2025-portugal/01K6XB7Q0D55W7HVSWYRJZSHH3.jpeg)![My wife in the gardens of the old royal summer palace in Sintra, leaning against a wall with geometric ceramic tiles.](2025-portugal/01K6XB7S1QFFSKM280A7ZM62KJ.jpeg)

**2025-10-07**. We ended the fourth day at
[Severa](https://www.asevera.com/en/fado-restaurant/), one of the Fado
places in Lisbon. I usually go to Clube do Fado but my stepmother
knows the places to go and Faia had no tables left.

**2025-10-08**. On the fifth day we went to in Palmela, an old
fortress town north of Setúbal. The view is great. From now on it’s
just the two of us.

![Driving over a long bridge. The concrete looks like a big H with “rays” of metal streaming towards us.](2025-portugal/01K7261CQX4B6SFETX2MMH9WJP.jpeg)![Looking down a dry hill with a winding unpaved road towards a harbour city.](2025-portugal/01K7261E4CZKC88SXBZQBN68P8.jpeg)

The region is famous for Muscatel wine. We tasted some and it was great. And
we had some dried sheep cheese, a very soft cheese from Azeitão, pumpkin jam
and bread. Super tasty. And we didn’t even have dinner.

![The old town and a park and the hill with the old fortress at the top.](2025-portugal/01K72EGE70C2GZ5HGJKWAVTZ8M.jpeg)![Cobblestone streets, house facades covered in ceramic tiles, clothes on washing lines out to dry, iron wrought balcony railings. Sadly, also cars.](2025-portugal/01K72EGGSXZCXVP6PEGW957D21.jpeg)

**2025-10-09**. We went towards the Cape Espiche and walked to an old
ruin and back. Perfect weather. This is the area west of Sesimbra in
the Serra d’Arrábida.

![A dirt road loading towards the coastline.](2025-portugal/01K74Z8YCCCPSCMETHZVVFS8DX.jpeg)![Up here the grass is very dry. Some dry thistles in the foreground.](2025-portugal/01K74Z90NE4GC7K5Z9SAGFJGYQ.jpeg)![The small strip of coast that drops off towards the ocean is green. It looks like a 30 degree angle, and then a steep drop.](2025-portugal/01K74Z93CCNW0TY1BDSD95QEHV.jpeg)![At the far end, a ruin and the ocean in the sun.](2025-portugal/01K74Z96RAXD5E7V4CKRQW0CYF.jpeg)

I had never seen a praying mantis before. This one was moving very
slowly on the dirt path.

![A green insect on red dust, a bit like a grasshopper, but the back legs are very thin and the front legs are huge.](2025-portugal/01K76MY6D1NGD9JSSVKXWFJDQ3.jpeg)

At the Cabo Espichel there was a closed church and a ruined building
that looked like a two storey hostel with windows walled shut. It
looked depressing and I did not take any pictures. I preferred looking
at the coastline and the sea.

![The steep coastline at Cabo Espichel where the flat land drops into the sea below.](2025-portugal/image-1.jpg)

On the way back we stopped in Sesimbra, had coffee and watched people
walk by. A perfect way to chill out before returning to the hotel.

![Claudia and I drinking coffee. A galão is usually a morning drink: a glass of milk with a shot of espresso and no milk foam, unlike a latte macchiato.](2025-portugal/image-2.jpg)

**2025-10-10**. Today we drove to Évora and on the way we stopped at
Alcácer do Sal. The region produces a third of Portugal’s rice,
apparently.

![From across the river, the old town with white houses and tiled roofs plus a church with two towers.](2025-portugal/01K781V8AD2Y94CRYNXYFY5KXG.jpeg)![Away from the river, flat lands with a big field of rice.](2025-portugal/01K781VBF0XFAYAHHC41TE4ZNA.jpeg)![Standing on a bridge, a view of the city where all lines converge on a point: wetland, mud, river, street, houses, horizon.](2025-portugal/01K781VD7HP3HFS54WXPJBVJM0.jpeg)![From the same bridge, a picture of the rice landscape where all lines converge on a point: water, mud, reeds, rice, trees, sky.](2025-portugal/01K781VG142B6CKR3YZE12C2Z7.jpeg)![This is Portugal, too: an old house facade, totally ruined, windows walled shut, paint falling off, bricks visible, graffiti, ads. Everything is falling apart.](2025-portugal/01K781VMCT81T212E08C9RHMGQ.jpeg)

We stopped at Nossa Senhora de Guadelupe for the standing stones.

![Rounded standing stones. Nearly one hundred of them.](2025-portugal/01K782P816RC9JBSEDDGN8ZKG3.jpeg)![More standing stones and a cork oak.](2025-portugal/01K782PKGGGG289GKGHSWYPX4X.jpeg)![A trail between wire fences. Left and right are cork oaks or olive trees.](2025-portugal/01K782PZ8P3VBZBAV9TRKJ3HVA.jpeg)![A standing stone, many metres tall.](2025-portugal/01K782QBQFMM6KZ7B95AZ5PBHG.jpeg)

We reached Évora.

![A ruin of a Roman temple in the middle of a Portuguese town.](2025-portugal/01K782Z4FA53GJHZ7DYH1HJ1TG.jpeg)![A few columns reaching into the sky are all that remain of the old Diana or the old imperial temple. A reminder that all billionaires must eventually die.](2025-portugal/01K782Z8YMWTVCPFYHJJVWP2ND.jpeg)![A view of Évora from a slightly elevated position. The buildings are white, with yellow highlight at the ground level and the corners, two stories high, with tiled roofs. The cobble-stone roads are narrow.](2025-portugal/01K782ZNF8JXS7WGSH26MJYKC9.jpeg)

**2025-10-11**. Seeing so many martyrs dying, so many tortured Jesus
sculptures, so many golden dresses, fancy hats, silver and gold, I am
sick and tired of churches.

![The ceiling is white, the walls above gold encrusted and full of paintings, the the walls below are made of blue and white ceramic tiles.](2025-portugal/01K7A4G59DCX13SCNMSR78K2HX.jpeg)![The columns support an impossibly high ceiling and in the far distance shines a golden altar.](2025-portugal/01K7A4GAW841VX3GC6W6XJ1DSR.jpeg)![I’m standing on the cathedral’s roof with sandals, long trousers and a white t-shirt and sunglasses, hat in hand.](2025-portugal/01K7A4GEZ50W0DVKC0HF7GK8CQ.jpeg)![Looking from the roof of the cathedral into the cloister.](2025-portugal/01K7A4HVVP699667KS48S3KJ7G.jpeg)

Coffee culture is very much to my liking. I also like the ceramic
tiles, I guess. Very cool in summer and very different from what I see
in Switzerland.

![The backstreets of Évora with white walls, yellow color accents, and cobblestone roads.](2025-portugal/01K7A4WGQRV6GT2S5PPXRJK6ZG.jpeg)![One of the rooms in the university. Feels like a wizarding school! Deep bordaux chairs, a band of painted tiles, white walls, and a wooden ceiling.](2025-portugal/01K7A4WP21VAG0Z8XMB8EKK5B8.jpeg)![A traditional pastry and coffee place. You eat and drink while standing at the counter.](2025-portugal/01K7A4WSDHYXBDC04YE1YXJAFC.jpeg)![Arcades at the university with blue on white tiles along the lower part of the walls. The doors lead to small lecture halls.](2025-portugal/01K7A53PC6DA07XZ4CH03WGJE9.jpeg)![Me, in a stairwell, looking up. Blue on white tiles decorate the lower part of the wall.](2025-portugal/01K7A53X3P4CW6F6FKN63PBYG5.jpeg)![The university courtyard. Cobblestones, yellow accent, arcades, two floors.](2025-portugal/01K7A5747KQ4V0TVP8T9QX07MA.jpeg)

They say that the Marquês de Pombal closed the university after two
hundred years to kick the religious orders including the Jesuits out
of Portugal in order to end the Inquisition. That doesn’t sound so
bad. He also helped out when the big earthquake struck in 1755. But
when you read the [Wikipedia\
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_de_Carvalho_e_Melo,_1st_Marquis_of_Pombal),
a different man emerges. Optimizing the slave trade, for example.
Uuuuugh.

I feel like “no war but class war” would apply to him, too. I lived in
Oeiras as a kid in the eighties and remember a part of his estate
still exists.

**2025-10-12**. We went on a long drive around the reservoir behind
the Alqueva Dam. It has a catchment area of 250 km² – it was filled in
2003, long after I had left Portugal, so it was all new to me. We
visited Monsaraz, first.

![Looking from old fortifications towards the lake.](2025-portugal/01K7CSE04TCGQHVK6KN2MK6TX3.jpeg)![Looking from old fortifications onto a small village on a hill with a church in the background.](2025-portugal/01K7CSE32BXS9YK4WBAZD98QXV.jpeg)![A panorama shot showing a cemetery at the bottom, the lake in the distance, and the dry land if the Alentejo with occasional shrubs, olive trees or cork oaks.](2025-portugal/01K7CSE990JGWFF4X7FZTDPRM6.jpeg)

We went to Mourão, next. The town is small, the fortress is crumbling.

![The dry grass with the occasional olive tree and a huge water reservoir in the back.](2025-portugal/01K7D1X666H3SVQNFPB900V6B5.jpeg)![Crumbling fortifications and a white church in the middle of it.](2025-portugal/01K7D1X8HERN1J0WZKCGF35Q20.jpeg)![A panorama view from the old fortifications with Claudia standing in the middle.](2025-portugal/01K7D21E98BBVEKDNQ1DN0TBEV.jpeg)

By that time we were hungry and in the middle of sleepy Mourão we found a
little park with a coffee stand where we had queijadas, café (espresso), galão
(espresso with a lot of milk) and a small bottle of Pedras Salgadas (salty
sparkling mineral water).

![Me, on the main square, with the park in my back.](2025-portugal/01K7D23NCRTBQ10Q88E26JNQ2Y.jpeg)![A kiosk hiding under some trees.](2025-portugal/01K7D23RMXNMB84BBD3PAP8ZJT.jpeg)![Claudia sitting at the table, eating cake.](2025-portugal/01K7D23V6VE7TR3EVSHFYXHM68.jpeg)![Me, drinking coffee.](2025-portugal/01K7D23YSY95DQS28Z6K7DGQWE.jpeg)

We crossed the Alqueda Dam and went for a small walk.

![The lake, seen from the dam. It’s big.](2025-portugal/01K7D2CDQ0EC6499AC14E14P73.jpeg)![The dam infrastructure behind the dam. It’s big. There are emergency overflows and electrical things. Not shown is the gazillion doves nesting here.](2025-portugal/01K7D2CGJJHSBA48VMFQQNB0RR.jpeg)![The river downstream from the dam is wide and quiet. It’s big, too. Like a lake.](2025-portugal/01K7D2CJAR1EPAT8Y1CR83Y7HN.jpeg)

And finally, we went for a small walk from Alqueda to a side arm of the lake.
There, I saw a water snake, a gazillion fish, a hare, several herons (big grey
ones and smaller white ones), and then, suddenly, at the bend in the distance,
a commotion. The water was wild. We saw three or for cormorants, hunting. And
then, after moving slowly along the shore, they took flight. Claudia started
counting and got to 25! So the three or four we saw where the ones on the
surface and the madness in the water was the remaining twenty cormorants.
Amazing.

I need to come here one day when everything is green.](2025-portugal/01K7D2TMNKKYGBACXPCZJANQCB.jpeg)![Me, on a gravel road.](2025-portugal/01K7D2TRFBNT94520HZ5V7TRYS.jpeg)![A picture taken from a small bridge over a tiny corner of the lake.

**2025-10-13**. We drove from Évora to Estremoz. Our first two stops
were Redondo and Vila Viçosa. Apparently the region between Vila
Viçosa and Estremos has had marble quarries since Roman times and the
region is still the second largest European marble export after
Carrara in Italy. Or so it says in our tourist guide. A paper book! It
must be true. They have so much marble that they use it for sidewalks
and road signs, set into the cobblestone streets.

![Typical one and two story houses, chalked white, with yellow or blue accents. The one on the right is Porfirio’s restaurant (closed).](2025-portugal/01K7HF42DTD6KXZ9CYHQ4H5GN4.jpeg)![Old fortifications with a gate and white buildings visible inside the old town.](2025-portugal/01K7HF45FPJMRR8PBR9TAF4W1X.jpeg)![The sidewalk is made of white and purple marble.

Marble everywhere.

Sadly, Estremoz is also a throwback to older times: wild dogs
defending their territory. Wild cats and their young being fed in the
street. Chained dogs barking and howling with fear and rage and
torment. Bull fighting arenas. They don’t kill the bulls, they just
torment them. And everywhere, ruins. Ruined industries. Ruined
buildings.

These pictures are from Vila Viçosa, Borba and Estremoz.

We didn’t go on a tour into the marble quarries but we went jogging
and took some pictures from the street. There are no easy access
points. Everything is fenced off.

The Portuguese are very discrete. Their front entrances don’t have
names. Their doorbells don’t have names. Their mailboxes don’t have
names. Your letter might say for whom it is, in what village, street,
number, floor, left or right – but the name is optional since the post
people won’t be able to check. When they answer the phone, they just
say “I’m here” but they don’t say their name. If you ask, it’s rude.
The caller is supposed to state their name and who they’re trying to
reach. This used to be very confusing for me and my family because in
German-speaking phone culture the person picking up the phone says who
they are, then the caller says who they are, and then the conversation
proceeds.

Sometimes I wonder whether such privacy-consciousness is a consequence
of having lived through a dictatorship.

The view of a corporatist state (super into unions and against
parties) who is opposed to both communism and liberalism is super
interesting, if you want to know more:
[Estado Novo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estado_Novo_(Portugal)).

**2025-10-14**. Some more impressions of the fortifications – and
here, too, a throwback to the eighties: people just dumping garbage
over the wall.

![A marble tower! It is not quite white but clearly made of a different material.](2025-portugal/01K7HNN97518ZC21F8CKMBS7PZ.jpeg)![A marble gate in the city wall with my wife on the drawbridge.

**2025-10-15**. Today we were in Elvas. Without a drone, we couldn’t
take any pictures from above. But we walked a lot. 😄 I’m skipping all
the interior rooms, bunker-like tunnels and the nationalist and
pro-army messages from 1959 on the walls.

The [UNESCO site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1367/gallery/) has
some nice pictures.

![From the bulwark over the entrance towards the marshal’s office.](2025-portugal/01K7MQ5G7X6RPDVG3DX0J704WH.jpeg)![The inner wall looks like a ship coming towards you with it’s pointy end sailing the moat.](2025-portugal/01K7MQ5HSC94VJ98BR4YNT7JXH.jpeg)![From the innermost wall towards one of the four sections with officer’s quarters.](2025-portugal/01K7MQ5KGCK0C5J6S70R7ZYSSY.jpeg)![The fortifications towards one of the hills extends even further.

Elvas itself is similar except there’s an entire town up here.

![Similar fortifications as on the Forte da Graça but less maintained.](2025-portugal/01K7MQGMR7RJRN3QDERTNT00M1.jpeg)![The multi-story aqueduct delivering water to Elvas.](2025-portugal/01K7MQGQTZ4Z924CN2NTQPNZTD.jpeg)![Another view of the aqueduct from a lousy perspective.](2025-portugal/01K7MQGV0XG0F2KC3R7G93HPDH.jpeg)![One of the gates into the old town with a chapel on top.](2025-portugal/01K7MQGY3BJD8G4MTMSNNKWETA.jpeg)

**2025-10-16**. We drove to Marvão, another fortress town on the
Portuguese side of the border.

&#62; “The Portugal–Spain border, also referred to as “the Stripe”, is one of the
&#62; oldest geopolitical borders in the world. The current demarcation is almost
&#62; identical to that defined in 1297 by the Treaty of Alcañices.”
&#62; – [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal%E2%80%93Spain_border)

(This is not the Treaty of Tordesillas that divided up the globe.)

Personally the most amazing thing is that there are Eurasian griffon vultures
(Gyps fulvus) nesting in the cliff below. No phone pictures of these, however.

![The outer walls with a little park](2025-portugal/01K7PYXC784YK6FHY4GC8Q6ZS8.jpeg)![The main tower and more walls on a hilltop.](2025-portugal/01K7PYY7E61JPVTKHM454YRYGZ.jpeg)![The fortress seen from the city park.](2025-portugal/01K7PYYHN4YN8V7V8NZHX9SB9A.jpeg)![The surprisingly green valley below.](2025-portugal/01K7PYYRG2MNHF39ZENX41Z3TF.jpeg)

Actually, if you zoom that one picture far enough, there’s a vulture far
below.

![A vaguely bird-like shape of grey flying above some trees.](2025-portugal/01K7PZ6TE8FTQKS5BZB4ETZ3T1.jpeg)

And look at that! Another praying mantis:

![My second praying mantis. My wife spotted it while we were walking past it.](2025-portugal/01K7PYYT7H0HRE0RHQ8SHMXEXC.jpeg)

We went on a long walk from Marvão to Castelo de Vide via Carreiras. I took a
lot of pictures of the road. Often, we were walking on a medieval road.

![Cork oaks to the left and right, skinned. Where the bark has been taken off, they are rust-coloured.](2025-portugal/01K7SM85WP27XE35GXJQKYAT2Y.jpeg)![Dry stone walls to the left and right.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8A461QAVYAVCFTB70232.jpeg)![Thorny shrubs to the left and right.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8DYCCTZNQCJT9J7EDX6J.jpeg)![More dry stone walls to the left and right.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8J3B4Q6QKB70NY667M3H.jpeg)![A paved road and dry stone walls on both sides.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8MBY2MP4W8R3Q17P4WYB.jpeg)![My wife and I, both with sunglasses and wide-brimmed hats.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8PMYAK7078ZNHY71TCMX.jpeg)![A gravel road towards a green hill.](2025-portugal/01K7SME95Q6YMSMF8YMRYB4BDX.jpeg)![A medieval road through a light forest.](2025-portugal/01K7SMEDWWBKY406HE2PJDTWT0.jpeg)

As we approached the end of the hike, we descended a slope that must have
burned not so long ago.

![A paved road through a black and brown burned forest.](2025-portugal/01K7SMEHK3STDE6T3SRP1YKREK.jpeg)![A medieval road past some blackened trees. It looks like a nightmare.](2025-portugal/01K7SMEP72NBJZ1XKZ6NVW9ABS.jpeg)![Some trees show green leaves sprouting.](2025-portugal/01K7SMES95G69N5WVXSWBBXB9K.jpeg)![So many autumn crocus were peeking out of the road.](2025-portugal/01K7SMEW5F26BMRJP4F9GH0WSR.jpeg)

**2025-10-17**. Today we went on a 60km drive to see the gap where the
Tejo river breaks through the mountains to continue its journey to
Lisbon. These are the Portas de Ródão. Not quite the Gates of Rohan,
but close. 😂

The paper industry loves Eucalyptus trees and the summer forest fires
do, too. As a kid I was surprised to learn that the eucalyptus tree is
not a Portuguese native! So now we imported both: the trees, and the
forest fires.

![When we left the village, the dirt road lead through dry meadows and light eucalyptus forests.](2025-portugal/01K7WARZRTAC9X3XY01CE09SD0.jpeg)

I feel that we’ll see more water reservoirs in central Europe as the
climate heats up. Unless the North Atlantic Gulf Stream breaks down in
which case we’ll get Canadian weather. Ugh!

![A surprising number of water reservoirs. The water is a horrible green but we saw big frogs.](2025-portugal/01K7WAS4KD08T4TWRWQZAXY720.jpeg)

Coming from Switzerland, mountain chain is not very impressive.

![More eucalyptus trees.](2025-portugal/01K7WAS8K2G0VS5N2FQ5C78M1P.jpeg)![Further up, some pine trees.](2025-portugal/01K7WASDG3K3KBYYE315VXBKYM.jpeg)

We got to the top of the Serra de São Miguel and walked towards the gap.

![Looking back at the flat lands we came from. Some bright green bushes.](2025-portugal/01K7WB3SHGGA0HNPZV1EJ2FKP0.jpeg)![Claudia standing next to a hole in the rock wall. It’s an old gold mine and the sign says not to enter.](2025-portugal/01K7WB3XZ6Q0JK8K5ZRBBSK280.jpeg)![Looking east, the river is wide and slow. Trees. A bridge.

What did impress us to no end, however, were the forty Eurasian
griffon vultures we saw circling above us; the countless young we saw
in the rock face; the adults coming and going. Such impressive birds.

6s of vultures circling above.

4s of vultures flying below.

11s of vultures returning home to their cliff.

![I wanted to take a funny selfie of Claudia and me so I’m pulling a face but Claudia has spotted some vultures and is no longer interested in the selfie, excitedly pointing elsewhere.](2025-portugal/image-75.jpg)![Claudia and I smiling at the camera.](2025-portugal/image-79.jpg)

Our walk wasn’t over, however. It was a long way back along the river and up another chain of hills.

![I’m walking in a light forest on a rough track.](2025-portugal/image-78.jpg)

**2025-10-19**. We left Portugal’s east and drove towards Leiria.
We’re staying in Alvados near Porto de Mós, hoping to do some hiking
in the Serras de Aire e Candeeiros Nature Park. It’s near Fátima, if
you know your way around famous pilgrimage destinations.

![The view from our hotel window shows a wilderness trees and shrubs and a hill in the distance,](2025-portugal/image-3.jpg)

**2025-10-20**. We went on the Fórnea walk: First along the foot of
the hill through some olive groves, then into a valley where a
waterfall shows up on rainy days, and finally onto the hill itself, to
see the plateau, and back down.

![Claudia and I are ready to go, wearing sunglasses and grinning.](2025-portugal/image-73.jpg)![A dirt road winds itself through shrubland towards the hills in the distance.](2025-portugal/image-4.jpg)![The grass is dry, the thistles brown.](2025-portugal/image-5.jpg)

The olive trees are small so that the olives can be harvested without
ladders. We saw a few farmers – often a man and a woman – cutting
branches and stripping olives over a big net they had spread beneath
the tree.

![Small olive trees to the left and right of the dirt road.](2025-portugal/image-6.jpg)![The trail turns towards the mountains. It’s aiming for a gap.](2025-portugal/image-7.jpg)![The waterfall is try. All we can see is a rock layer breaking through the hill side.](2025-portugal/image-8.jpg)

This is karst, where water disappears into underground caverns and the
surface world is dry. But here, in this valley surrounded by hills,
there is enough humidity to allow some lushness.

![The trail is narrow and greenery rises on both sides.](2025-portugal/image-9.jpg)![The sky is overcast and Claudia and I are no longer wearing our sunglasses.](2025-portugal/image-10.jpg)![The dirt road continues and begins to rise in the distance.](2025-portugal/image-11.jpg)![We’re further up now, looking back at the olive groves below.](2025-portugal/image-12.jpg)![The autumn crokus growing out of the ground without leaves, just a flower on a short stalk, continues to amaze me.](2025-portugal/image-13.jpg)![The plateau at the top of the hill features a gazillion little meadows, each surrounded by a dry stone wall.](2025-portugal/image-14.jpg)

The plateau up here is very humid. Is it the altitude? I don’t know.

We also saws four dead fire salamanders. Huge ones! Apparently, the
Portuguese fire salamanders are suffering from a fungus that damages
their skin and kills them within a week or two. Was this the reason?
The animals did not seem run over by a car or eaten by a carnivore.

![Our trail led around the back of the hill top.](2025-portugal/image-15.jpg)![And finally, the view into the natural amphitheatre.](2025-portugal/image-16.jpg)

I keep thinking about the enclosures.

![The sun is back and so are our sunglasses. We’re still on the plateau with the green meadows and the dry stone walls.](2025-portugal/image-17.jpg)![The trail doesn’t cross any meadows. It always goes between two walls separating these meadows.](2025-portugal/image-76.jpg)

Down there somewhere is the green valley we had seen before.

![Claudia and our goal in the valley below.](2025-portugal/image-18.jpg)![Claudia](2025-portugal/image-19.jpg)

**2025-10-21**. We went to see some Dinosaur foot steps, Fátima and Batalha.

![The dinosaur footsteps are in a plain of limestone that used to be the bottom of an old quarry.](2025-portugal/image-20.jpg)

The very nice and knowledgeable person who let us in during lunch
break explained that the scientists had washed the depressions of the
sauropod footsteps in order to make them more visible. The just
cleaned the limestone of algae and lichen.

They had also errected a wooden walkway above the limestone to protect
the sauropod footsteps from humans. Unfortunately, the wood used had
unexpectedly leaked fungicides and other toxins, killing off the
lichen and algae growing on the limestone. The effect is that it looks
just as whitewashed as the actual footstops the scientists had washed.
It’ll take fix or six years to grow back, we were told.

The footsteps above the walkway are easy to spot, though.

![Seen from above, we can see how the grey limestone is in fact washed white below a wooden footbridge, as if the wood had leaked white colour onto the grey limestone.](2025-portugal/image-21.jpg)![In black and white the footsteps above the walkway are pretty easy to see.](2025-portugal/image-23.jpg)![Claudia and I on the walkway, in black and white, grinning.](2025-portugal/image-22.jpg)![The limestone comes in layers that are easy to spot as they look like irregular stairs.](2025-portugal/image-24.jpg)![The limestone forms a karst landscape where the water disappears into the underworld. Here we see a hole in the limestone that looks like the beginning of a cave!](2025-portugal/image-25.jpg)![Looking away from the limestone for a moment, we see the landscape around the hill we’re on. Shrubs, trees, meadows in the distance.](2025-portugal/image-26.jpg)

Fátima is an important pilgrimage destination for Catholics in Europe,
like Lourdes in France or Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The square
is huge. The church is huge. There are chapels underground. Some
pilgrims do the last part of their pilgrimage on their knees.

It drives tears to my eyes to see grown men and women debase
themselves like that, in the rain, on the cold, hard stone, in 2025.
It’s revolting to see the prayer at the beginning of this passage say:

&#62; Most Holy Trinity
&#62;
&#62; Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
&#62;
&#62; I adore you profoundly.
&#62;
&#62; My heart rejoices
&#62;
&#62; For the many blessings
&#62;
&#62; You have bestowed upon me.
&#62;
&#62; Accept this pilgrimage on my knees …

It’s heart wrenching to see how these people believe, to imagine the
torment and fear that brought them to this place, and to think that
the church felt this was the best way to help them.

![A big square, mostly empty. The sign mentioned above marks the beginning of the passage where some people, mostly middle aged women, are on their knees, in the rain.](2025-portugal/image-72.jpg)

The [Monastery of Batalha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalha_Monastery)
was erected in commemoration of the 1385 Battle of Aljubarrota where
the Portuguese and their English allies defeated the Castile and their
French allies as well as their Genoese mercenaries.

I keep thinking about all the poor people that built all this shit.

![An impressive old building, looks like a humongous church.](2025-portugal/image-27.jpg)![A huge church, impossibly high ceiling, unadorned columns, an altar in the far distance.](2025-portugal/image-28.jpg)![I’m admiring the ceiling and the columns.

**2025-10-22**. We drove to our last hotel in A-dos-Cunhados, near the
beach. On the way we stopped in Nazaré and Peniche, hoping to see some
waves.

I was hoping, against all odds, that we’d see those 30m high waves in
Nazaré. Sadly, no such luck.

![I’m standing in front of the famous lighthouse from where people stare at the high waves, if there are any. I’m cold. There are some tourists, here.](2025-portugal/image-54.jpg)![The northern beach with almost nobody on it and a grey sky above. A sign warns of the crumbling cliffs.](2025-portugal/image-55.jpg)![Claudia and I, with the wind raising my hair so that I look quite silly.](2025-portugal/image-36.jpg)

Peniche is another surfer hotspot but the waves where not impressive.

We arrived at our hotel near Santa Cruz and discovered that there was a footpath to the beach!

The hotel we’re staying in has a the best bathtub I have ever seen.

![It looks like a concrete bathtub set into the floor.](2025-portugal/image-70.jpg)

**2025-10-23**. We met my mom in Mafra, saw the royal summer palace,
built by 45,000 people over 13 years (including a lot of forced
labour) and then it was only used for a few years. Royalty is misery.

![The lazaret looks remarkably like an emergency entry of a hospital to day with each bed having a little alcove and a curtain.

**2025-10-24**. We spent our day on the beach.

The plant that’s growing in large green-reddish patches on the sand up here is _Gelbe Mittagsblume_ or _Carpobrotus edulis_, with thick, sharply triangular fingers reaching up from the ground. An invasive species, if I remember correctly.

Useful collection of examples by Shaun Pedicini who tested Seedream 4, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen-Image-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext \[dev\], FLUX.1 Kontext \[max\], OmniGen2, and OpenAI gpt-image-1 across 12 image editing prompts.

The tasks are very neatly selected, for example:

&#62; `Remove all the brown pieces of candy from the glass bowl`

Qwen-Image-Edit (a model that [can be self-hosted](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/19/qwen-image-edit/)) was the only one to successfully manage that!

This kind of collection is really useful for building up an intuition as to how well image editing models work, and which ones are worth trying for which categories of task.

Shaun has [a similar page for text-to-image models](https://genai-showdown.specr.net/) which are not fed an initial image to modify, with further challenging prompts like:

      <title>Still unfinished, still shareable</title>
      <link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/still-unfinished-still-shareable/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A little while back (six months ago) I <a href="https://kwon.nyc/notes/unfinished-but-shareable/">wrote</a> about how I made a random page featuring my <a href="https://kwon.nyc/dad-hats/">dad&rsquo;s hats</a> and how I want to make more evergreen content and share more photos and visual things here.</p>
        <p>For some things in my life I have become very decisive but this website is not one of them. Lol. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s one of my few creative practices that I do purely for fun and so I feel a lot of pressure to make it amazing.</p>
        <p>In my work life, I have gotten fairly reliable at managing my own projects, and collaborating with other people who are managing their own. I have also taken a similar approach to life admin and organization; I am at the point in my life where managing my own health and finances are also projects that need to be managed and tracked; not because I am particularly un/healthy or un/wealthy, but more because when you&rsquo;ve been around for a few decades there&rsquo;s just more STUFF that you generate with regard to taking care of yourself.</p>
        <p>Anyway, all that is fine, but I just&hellip; don&rsquo;t necessarily want to feel like I&rsquo;m project-managing a thing in my personal life something that&rsquo;s supposed purely for fun, i.e., this website. And unfortunately that has translated to many ideas that seem exciting at first but then as soon as I&rsquo;ve documented one and decided to try and execute on it, it languishes. I have also incurred quite a bit of technical debt on this website based on fleeting decisions I made years ago, which also makes me hesitate to just build something even if it&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
        <p>The &ldquo;personal website as digital garden&rdquo; metaphor is one that many people have resonated with, and for good reason. &ldquo;Working with the garage door open&rdquo; is another one I like, especially because it unlocks some core memories of my suburban midwestern upbringing. And remember those &ldquo;Under Construction&rdquo; signs (gifs) we used to put on pages on our websites, before reverse-chronological blogging was a thing? I like that metaphor, too. At some point you just have to describe the thing and not use the metaphor as an entire allegory, though.</p>
        <p>Well, the whole point of this was to share some things I have been gingerly working on lately &ndash; think of it as me working on the garden in my garage with the door open and a construction sign in the driveway :)</p>
        <p>So anyway&hellip; I made these (<em>throws them on the ground in front of you and runs away</em>):</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong><a href="https://index.kwon.nyc/">index.kwon.nyc</a></strong>: An index page, as a way to track updates and show the delta between what this site is today and all my grand plans for it &ndash; maybe they will materialize faster if I create some accountability for myself by publishing them there. Or maybe I&rsquo;ll continue to think of fun ideas and then stare at my own belly button for months. It also puts all the random orphaned pages I&rsquo;ve created, like <a href="https://projects.kwon.nyc/internet-is-fun">The internet used to be fun</a>, in some context / information architecture. (&ldquo;Orphan&rdquo; is probably not very inclusive; if you have a better way to refer to them let me know. Although I supposed they&rsquo;re no longer orphaned now that they&rsquo;re on an index page.)</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://kwon.photos/">kwon.photos</a></strong>: The beginnings of a photo site, at a domain I bought a while ago and sat on because (inner dialogue incoming) I&rsquo;m not a photographer but still want to share things in the world around me that I notice and think are worth capturing but there are already too many photos online and nobody will care about mine and I don&rsquo;t even know how I would start to build a photo site these days, what is a WebP and an AVIF and what do you mean <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>, don&rsquo;t you mean <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> (end inner dialogue). Anywho, I also actually <a href="https://github.com/rjkwon/photos/blob/main/README.md">wrote documentation</a> for the first time ever (tryna look out for future me) since I am trying out a new stack including a totally different static site generator, Astro (on a tip from <a href="https://www.iamrob.in/">Robin</a> who used it to build his <a href="https://robins.photos/">cool photo site</a>), and a Node-based image processor, Sharp. (Back in my day, we had to manually make thumbnail images in Photoshop&hellip;)</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://kwon.nyc/cans/">kwon.nyc/cans</a></strong>: A sub-site with some neat-looking cans of craft beer I have had over the years. This one is an idea I had so long ago, that took me so long to execute on, that I don&rsquo;t even really drink beer that much anymore 😂 I still appreciate a cute can though.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Disclosure: I did (and do) use an AI chatbot to help me build websites, although I have pretty specific guidelines for how I use them and don&rsquo;t use them. I&rsquo;ll write more about my thoughts later but tl;dr I&rsquo;m not anti-chatbot, obviously, but I do think they are very specific tools that have very specific use cases (<strong>ASK:</strong> can you send me any AI disclosures you&rsquo;ve seen on personal sites, or if you have one on your own? I&rsquo;ve seen some good ones lately but of course forgotten to bookmark them).</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>A little while back (six months ago) I [wrote](https://kwon.nyc/notes/unfinished-but-shareable/) about how I made a random page featuring my [dad’s hats](https://kwon.nyc/dad-hats/) and how I want to make more evergreen content and share more photos and visual things here.

For some things in my life I have become very decisive but this website is not one of them. Lol. Maybe it’s because it’s one of my few creative practices that I do purely for fun and so I feel a lot of pressure to make it amazing.

In my work life, I have gotten fairly reliable at managing my own projects, and collaborating with other people who are managing their own. I have also taken a similar approach to life admin and organization; I am at the point in my life where managing my own health and finances are also projects that need to be managed and tracked; not because I am particularly un/healthy or un/wealthy, but more because when you’ve been around for a few decades there’s just more STUFF that you generate with regard to taking care of yourself.

Anyway, all that is fine, but I just… don’t necessarily want to feel like I’m project-managing a thing in my personal life something that’s supposed purely for fun, i.e., this website. And unfortunately that has translated to many ideas that seem exciting at first but then as soon as I’ve documented one and decided to try and execute on it, it languishes. I have also incurred quite a bit of technical debt on this website based on fleeting decisions I made years ago, which also makes me hesitate to just build something even if it’s not perfect.

The “personal website as digital garden” metaphor is one that many people have resonated with, and for good reason. “Working with the garage door open” is another one I like, especially because it unlocks some core memories of my suburban midwestern upbringing. And remember those “Under Construction” signs (gifs) we used to put on pages on our websites, before reverse-chronological blogging was a thing? I like that metaphor, too. At some point you just have to describe the thing and not use the metaphor as an entire allegory, though.

Well, the whole point of this was to share some things I have been gingerly working on lately – think of it as me working on the garden in my garage with the door open and a construction sign in the driveway :)

So anyway… I made these ( _throws them on the ground in front of you and runs away_):

1. **[index.kwon.nyc](https://index.kwon.nyc/)**: An index page, as a way to track updates and show the delta between what this site is today and all my grand plans for it – maybe they will materialize faster if I create some accountability for myself by publishing them there. Or maybe I’ll continue to think of fun ideas and then stare at my own belly button for months. It also puts all the random orphaned pages I’ve created, like [The internet used to be fun](https://projects.kwon.nyc/internet-is-fun), in some context / information architecture. (“Orphan” is probably not very inclusive; if you have a better way to refer to them let me know. Although I supposed they’re no longer orphaned now that they’re on an index page.)
2. **[kwon.photos](https://kwon.photos/)**: The beginnings of a photo site, at a domain I bought a while ago and sat on because (inner dialogue incoming) I’m not a photographer but still want to share things in the world around me that I notice and think are worth capturing but there are already too many photos online and nobody will care about mine and I don’t even know how I would start to build a photo site these days, what is a WebP and an AVIF and what do you mean `&#60;picture&#62;`, don’t you mean `&#60;img&#62;` (end inner dialogue). Anywho, I also actually [wrote documentation](https://github.com/rjkwon/photos/blob/main/README.md) for the first time ever (tryna look out for future me) since I am trying out a new stack including a totally different static site generator, Astro (on a tip from [Robin](https://www.iamrob.in/) who used it to build his [cool photo site](https://robins.photos/)), and a Node-based image processor, Sharp. (Back in my day, we had to manually make thumbnail images in Photoshop…)
3. **[kwon.nyc/cans](https://kwon.nyc/cans/)**: A sub-site with some neat-looking cans of craft beer I have had over the years. This one is an idea I had so long ago, that took me so long to execute on, that I don’t even really drink beer that much anymore 😂 I still appreciate a cute can though.

Disclosure: I did (and do) use an AI chatbot to help me build websites, although I have pretty specific guidelines for how I use them and don’t use them. I’ll write more about my thoughts later but tl;dr I’m not anti-chatbot, obviously, but I do think they are very specific tools that have very specific use cases ( **ASK:** can you send me any AI disclosures you’ve seen on personal sites, or if you have one on your own?

      <title>Don’t Forget These Tags to Make HTML Work Like You Expect</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/dont-forget-these-html-tags/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I was watching <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-10-24T2205" >Alex Petros’ talk</a> and he has a slide in there titled “Incantations that make HTML work correctly”.</p>
        <p>This got me thinking about the basic snippets of HTML I’ve learned to always include in order for my website to work as I expect in the browser — like “Hey I just made a <code>.html</code> file on disk and am going to open it in the browser. What should be in there?”</p>
        <p>This is what comes to mind:</p>
        <pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!doctype <span class="hljs-keyword">html</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span> <span class="hljs-attr">lang</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;en&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">meta</span> <span class="hljs-attr">charset</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;utf-8&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">meta</span> <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;viewport&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">content</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>Why each?</p>
        <h2 id="doctype">doctype</h2>
        <pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!doctype <span class="hljs-keyword">html</span>&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>Without <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>, browsers may switch to quirks mode, emulating legacy, pre-standards behavior. This will change how calculations work around layout, sizing, and alignment.</p>
        <p><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code> is what you want for consistent rendering. Or <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</code> if you prefer writing markup like it’s 1998. Or even <code>&lt;!doCTypE HTml&gt;</code> if you eschew all societal norms. It’s case-insensitive so they’ll all work.</p>
        <h2 id="html-lang">html lang</h2>
        <pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span> <span class="hljs-attr">lang</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;en&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>Declare the document’s language. Browsers, search engines, assistive technologies, etc. can leverage it to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Get pronunciation and voice right for screen readers</li>
        <li>Improve indexing and translation accuracy</li>
        <li>Apply locale-specific tools (e.g. spell-checking)</li>
        <li>And more…</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Omit it and things will <em>look</em> ok, but lots of basic web-adjacent tools might get things wrong. Specifying it makes everything <em>around</em> the HTML work better and more accurately, so I always try to remember to include it.</p>
        <h2 id="meta-utf-8">meta utf-8</h2>
        <p>This piece of info can come back from the server as a header, e.g.</p>
        <pre><code class="language language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Response</span>(
            <span class="hljs-string">&quot;&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello world&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;</span>,
            {
                <span class="hljs-attr">status</span>: <span class="hljs-number">200</span>,
                <span class="hljs-attr">headers</span>: { <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Content-Type&quot;</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;</span> },
            }
        );
        </code></pre>
        <p>But I like to set it in my HTML, especially when I’m making files on disk I open manually in the browser.</p>
        <pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">meta</span> <span class="hljs-attr">charset</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;utf-8&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>This tells the browser how to interpret text, ensuring characters like é, ü, and others display correctly. </p>
        <p>So many times I’ve opened a document without this tag and things just don’t look right — like my <a href="https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com" >smart quotes</a>.</p>
        <p>For example: copy this snippet, stick it in an HTML file, and open it on your computer:</p>
        <pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!doctype <span class="hljs-keyword">html</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">h1</span>&gt;</span>Without meta utf-8<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">h1</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dl</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>Smart quotes<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>“” and ‘’<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>Symbols<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>©, ™, ®, etc.<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>Ellipsis<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>…<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>Emojis<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>👍<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>Non-latin characters<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dt</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>é, ñ, etc.<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dd</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dl</span>&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>Things might look a bit wonky. But stick a <code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;</code>  tag in there and you’ll find some relief.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/basic-html-quotes-meta-tags.png" width="620" height="3000" alt="" />
        
        </p><h2 id="meta-viewport">Meta viewport</h2>
        <pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">meta</span> <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;viewport&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">content</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>Sometimes I’ll quickly prototype a little HTML and think, “Great it’s working as I expect!” Then I go open it on mobile and everything looks tiny — “[Facepalm] you forgot the meta viewport tag!”</p>
        <p>Take a look at this screenshot, where I forgot the meta viewport tag on the left but included it on the right:</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/basic-html-quotes-meta-viewport-tags.png" width="600" height="640" alt="Two screenshots of a basic HTML with an h1 tag that says “Hello world” that are side-by-side. The one on the left looks like it’s zoomed way out becuase it’s missing the meta viewport tag. The one on the right looks like you expect." />
        
        </p><p>That ever happen to you? No, just me? Well anyway, it’s a good ‘un to include to make HTML work the way you expect.</p>
        <h2 id="last-but-not-least">Last But Not Least…</h2>

      <source:markdown>I was watching [Alex Petros’ talk](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-10-24T2205) and he has a slide in there titled “Incantations that make HTML work correctly”.

This got me thinking about the basic snippets of HTML I’ve learned to always include in order for my website to work as I expect in the browser — like “Hey I just made a `.html` file on disk and am going to open it in the browser. What should be in there?”

This is what comes to mind:

```language html
&#60;!doctype html&#62;
&#60;html lang=&#34;en&#34;&#62;
&#60;meta charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&#62;
&#60;meta name=&#34;viewport&#34; content=&#34;width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0&#34;&#62;

```

Why each?

## doctype

```language html
&#60;!doctype html&#62;

```

Without `&#60;!doctype html&#62;`, browsers may switch to quirks mode, emulating legacy, pre-standards behavior. This will change how calculations work around layout, sizing, and alignment.

`&#60;!doctype html&#62;` is what you want for consistent rendering. Or `&#60;!DOCTYPE HTML&#62;` if you prefer writing markup like it’s 1998. Or even `&#60;!doCTypE HTml&#62;` if you eschew all societal norms. It’s case-insensitive so they’ll all work.

## html lang

```language html
&#60;html lang=&#34;en&#34;&#62;

```

Declare the document’s language. Browsers, search engines, assistive technologies, etc. can leverage it to:

- Get pronunciation and voice right for screen readers
- Improve indexing and translation accuracy
- Apply locale-specific tools (e.g. spell-checking)
- And more…

Omit it and things will _look_ ok, but lots of basic web-adjacent tools might get things wrong. Specifying it makes everything _around_ the HTML work better and more accurately, so I always try to remember to include it.

## meta utf-8

This piece of info can come back from the server as a header, e.g.

```language js
return new Response(
    &#34;&#60;!doctype html&#62;&#60;h1&#62;Hello world&#60;/h1&#62;&#34;,
    {
        status: 200,
        headers: { &#34;Content-Type&#34;: &#34;text/html; charset=utf-8&#34; },
    }
);

```

But I like to set it in my HTML, especially when I’m making files on disk I open manually in the browser.

```language html
&#60;meta charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&#62;

```

This tells the browser how to interpret text, ensuring characters like é, ü, and others display correctly.

So many times I’ve opened a document without this tag and things just don’t look right — like my [smart quotes](https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com).

For example: copy this snippet, stick it in an HTML file, and open it on your computer:

```language html
&#60;!doctype html&#62;
&#60;h1&#62;Without meta utf-8&#60;/h1&#62;
&#60;dl&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Smart quotes&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;“” and ‘’&#60;/dd&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Symbols&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;©, ™, ®, etc.&#60;/dd&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Ellipsis&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;…&#60;/dd&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Emojis&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;👍&#60;/dd&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Non-latin characters&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;é, ñ, etc.&#60;/dd&#62;
&#60;/dl&#62;

```

Things might look a bit wonky. But stick a `&#60;meta charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&#62;` tag in there and you’ll find some relief.

## Meta viewport

```language html
&#60;meta name=&#34;viewport&#34; content=&#34;width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0&#34;&#62;

```

Sometimes I’ll quickly prototype a little HTML and think, “Great it’s working as I expect!” Then I go open it on mobile and everything looks tiny — “\[Facepalm\] you forgot the meta viewport tag!”

Take a look at this screenshot, where I forgot the meta viewport tag on the left but included it on the right:

![Two screenshots of a basic HTML with an h1 tag that says “Hello world” that are side-by-side. The one on the left looks like it’s zoomed way out becuase it’s missing the meta viewport tag. The one on the right looks like you expect.](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/basic-html-quotes-meta-viewport-tags.png)

That ever happen to you? No, just me? Well anyway, it’s a good ‘un to include to make HTML work the way you expect.

## Last But Not Least…

I know what you’re thinking, I forgot the most important snippet of them all for writing HTML:

```language html
&#60;div id=&#34;root&#34;&#62;&#60;/div&#62;
&#60;script src=&#34;bundle.js&#34;&#62;&#60;/script&#62;

```

Lol.

I changed the [header graphic](https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/26/deBlasioPolice.png?nodialog) on Scripting News today to raise a question with NYC voters.

[Bill de Blasio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_de_Blasio) was mayor. A funeral for two murdered cops. The police stand at attention, their [backs turned](https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/26/deBlasioPolice.png?nodialog) on the mayor. This was a statement about him for sure, but even more about their disdain for the people who elected him, you and me, the people they&#39;re sworn to protect. I grew up in NY, and had plenty of experience with NY cops and this kind of disrespect is, from my point of view, who they are. I know they see themselves as martyrs, that&#39;s what the demonstration meant. But they also have a job to do and a chain of command.

There&#39;s a lot of pent up resentment and you can&#39;t just wish it away. The mayor, for better or worse, owns it. I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;d have much respect for the Democratic Party nominee. Like it or not, this is the city NYers live in.

I am old enough to remember when [John Lindsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay), a liberal Republican, back when there were such things, was the newly elected mayor in 1966 and was greeted by a transit strike, shutting down subways and buses. The unions walked all over him.

I think NYC and NYers will fare better with a [Andrew Cuomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo). This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve stood up for him [on this blog](https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=cuomo). He resigned in disgrace, humiliated, but I never will forget his leadership during the darkest times of Covid.

      <title>Setting up a codebase for working with coding agents</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Someone on Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45695621#45704966">asked for tips</a> on setting up a codebase to be more productive with AI coding tools. Here's my reply:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Good automated tests which the coding agent can run. I love pytest for this - one of my projects has 1500 tests and Claude Code is really good at selectively executing just tests relevant to the change it is making, and then running the whole suite at the end.</li>
        <li>Give them the ability to interactively test the code they are writing too. Notes on how to start a development server (for web projects) are useful, then you can have them use Playwright or curl to try things out.</li>
        <li>I'm having great results from maintaining a GitHub issues collection for projects and pasting URLs to issues directly into Claude Code.</li>
        <li>I actually don't think documentation is too important: LLMs can read the code a lot faster than you to figure out how to use it. I have comprehensive documentation across all of my projects but I don't think it's that helpful for the coding agents, though they are good at helping me spot if it needs updating.</li>
        <li>Linters, type checkers, auto-formatters - give coding agents helpful tools to run and they'll use them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the most part anything that makes a codebase easier for humans to maintain turns out to help agents as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: Thought of another one: detailed error messages! If a manual or automated test fails the more information you can return back to the model the better, and stuffing extra data in the error message or assertion is a very inexpensive way to do that.</p>

      <source:markdown>Someone on Hacker News [asked for tips](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45695621#45704966) on setting up a codebase to be more productive with AI coding tools. Here&#39;s my reply:

- Good automated tests which the coding agent can run. I love pytest for this - one of my projects has 1500 tests and Claude Code is really good at selectively executing just tests relevant to the change it is making, and then running the whole suite at the end.
- Give them the ability to interactively test the code they are writing too. Notes on how to start a development server (for web projects) are useful, then you can have them use Playwright or curl to try things out.
- I&#39;m having great results from maintaining a GitHub issues collection for projects and pasting URLs to issues directly into Claude Code.
- I actually don&#39;t think documentation is too important: LLMs can read the code a lot faster than you to figure out how to use it. I have comprehensive documentation across all of my projects but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that helpful for the coding agents, though they are good at helping me spot if it needs updating.
- Linters, type checkers, auto-formatters - give coding agents helpful tools to run and they&#39;ll use them.

For the most part anything that makes a codebase easier for humans to maintain turns out to help agents as well.

**Update**: Thought of another one: detailed error messages! If a manual or automated test fails the more information you can return back to the model the better, and stuffing extra data in the error message or assertion is a very inexpensive way to do that.

                    <p>Here I continue my efforts to design visualizations that are as poorly-suited as possible to being displayed on phones. It looks pretty good on a big monitor, or six feet wide on a wall.</p>
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I made a version of this plot a few years ago. I ended up revisiting it this morning  because I&rsquo;m updating various datasets and code. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot">Manhattan
        plot</a> is a term sometimes used to describe a kind of scatter plot where the x-values are fairly continuous, and
        the y values have distributions with long tails, so the plot looks like a skyline. This one here is a bar chart rather than a scatter plot but it&rsquo;s still a kind of Manhattan plot of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The plot shows the heights of almost all currently-existing buildings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in Manhattan (on the y-axis) by their year of construction on the x-axis. What I want is a plot that gives a sense of the distribution of building heights over time. To make the plot work I play a few tricks. First, the resolution of the x-axis is only to the year,which would result in way too much overplotting. (We have almost 35,000 buildings to draw.) So we add a small amount of random noise to the x-values, which makes buildings distribute themselves around their year of construction. There&rsquo;s still overplotting, but now it works in our favor. It contributes to a feeling of building density.</p>
        <p>Second, there are so many buildings that we can&rsquo;t plot everything as solid, filled rectangle. Instead, we make make the outlines of each rectangle a very thin white line, so everything looks like a vector-driven video game from 1981. Then we make a variable that bins buildings by height into ten categories, one for every hundred feet of additional roof height. We map that to fill color of the rectangles (darker purples for shorter buildings through bright yellow for taller ones), which means the taller a building the brighter it looks. But again, we can&rsquo;t just plot those as solid colors. So we also take the roof heights and rescale them to a range of 0.4 to 0.85. Then we map <em>that</em> number directly to the alpha channel of the fill color. So taller buildings are not only brighter in color, they are more opaque. Alpha runs from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). The specific values of 0.4 to 0.85 are just from trial and error. We want the taller buildings to stand out, and because there are fewer of them they need to be more opaque. Whereas the fills of many more shorter buildings will overlap, so they can be individually more transparent.</p>
        <p>You can really see the recent rise of supertall fancy apartment buildings in Manhattan in the last ten years or so&mdash;buildings like the curséd <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/111_West_57th_Street">111 West 57th</a> and

Here I continue my efforts to design visualizations that are as poorly-suited as possible to being displayed on phones. It looks pretty good on a big monitor, or six feet wide on a wall.

I made a version of this plot a few years ago. I ended up revisiting it this morning because I’m updating various datasets and code. A [Manhattan\
plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot) is a term sometimes used to describe a kind of scatter plot where the x-values are fairly continuous, and
the y values have distributions with long tails, so the plot looks like a skyline. This one here is a bar chart rather than a scatter plot but it’s still a kind of Manhattan plot of Manhattan.

The plot shows the heights of almost all currently-existing buildings[1](#fn:1) in Manhattan (on the y-axis) by their year of construction on the x-axis. What I want is a plot that gives a sense of the distribution of building heights over time. To make the plot work I play a few tricks. First, the resolution of the x-axis is only to the year,which would result in way too much overplotting. (We have almost 35,000 buildings to draw.) So we add a small amount of random noise to the x-values, which makes buildings distribute themselves around their year of construction. There’s still overplotting, but now it works in our favor. It contributes to a feeling of building density.

You can really see the recent rise of supertall fancy apartment buildings in Manhattan in the last ten years or so—buildings like the curséd [111 West 57th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/111_West_57th_Street) and

      <source:markdown>The illusion that Europe had better democratic processes and laws was shattered by their unequivocal support of the genocide in Palestine.

I used to nod vigorously when a righteous European politician made progressive statements. But it turns out, it was just the tool they reached out for to advance their crass goals.

An inch more tasteful than Trump, but Trumpian at their core.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>I see that the [WordPress world](https://wordpress.org/news/2025/05/announcing-the-formation-of-the-wordpress-ai-team/) is getting interested in adding AI features. I had some [ideas](http://scripting.com/2024/09/28/132152.html) a [few](http://scripting.com/2025/07/12/134525.html) [years](http://scripting.com/2025/03/20/151234.html) [ago](http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html), about how I would like AI to be hooked up to blogging, and the ideas have developed a bit in the years since.

As a writer I want most is every bit of writing I’ve published turned into any kind of book I want at any time.

An example of a book lurking in the archive of my blog.

_A user’s guide to FeedLand._

Knowing the AI would pull a users manual together on command, I’d feel more comfortable writing about it on my blog. As it is there’s a lot of good info between other blog posts.

I think it’s a great time to invest in new ideas for writers.

I have pretty good search on my blog, but so much more is possible.

Imagine a series of book types you could ask your AI friend to build for you from your own writing.

Eventually all user&#39;s guides will be assembled by AI. In the case of software products it should have already happened, though I&#39;m just as behind the curve as everyone else is in this regard.

And of course the first docs to be produced that way would be _A user&#39;s guide to WordPress._</source:markdown>

      <title>Ruins</title>
      <link>https://inkdroid.org/2025/10/25/ruins/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
        I recently finished <a
        href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/at-work-in-the-ruins/">At
        Work in the Ruins</a> by <a href="https://dougald.nu/">Dougald Hine</a>
        (co-author of the <a
        href="https://inkdroid.org/2025/06/05/dark-mountain/">The Dark Mountain
        Manifesto</a>). I aim to re-read it after it has sunk in a bit more. The
        arc of the book reminds me a bit of Bruno Latour’s thinking, in that it
        seems to make the axis of left/right political debates more two (or
        three) dimensional. In part, the book reflects on what we can learn from
        the response to the COVID19 pandemic, when thinking about climate
        change, and the unsustainable/extractive economies and ways of living in
        the west. I found some of the ideas challenging at first, but once I
        went through it, I found I wanted to return to the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
        The book concludes with four ways of working in the ruins, which I
        wanted to note here mostly as a reminder to myself:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
        The first kind of work that makes sense is to salvage the good that may
        be taken with us from the ruins of the world that is ending. Among the
        tangled legacies of modernity, there are gifts that we would not gladly
        leave behind, so this is the attempt to bring with us what we are able
        to carry.
        </p>
        <p>
        The second kind of work is to mourn the good that cannot be taken with
        us. There is no need to settle where the boundary lies between what can
        be saved and what is to be mourned; you may answer that question
        differently to me and only time will tell which of us was right, but
        this still leaves us with work to do in the meanwhile. Part of the work
        of mourning is to tell the stories of the good things that couldn’t be
        saved, for those stories can be taken with us and they may turn out to
        be seeds.
        </p>
        <p>
        The third kind of work involves discernment: notice the things within
        our ways of living that were never as good as we told ourselves they
        were and the chance we are being given to walk away from these. It is
        the strange gift of a time of endings to bring into view the gap between
        the things we are trying to do and the ways we went about doing them
        around here lately. Make use of this gift.
        </p>
        <p>
        The fourth kind of work is to look for the dropped threads, the moments
        earlier in the story that have something to tell us. The way of life
        that is ending had a beginning, and other ways were ending in that
        moment or being pushed to the edges. So look for the skills or practices
        or knowledges that have been marked as extinct and obsolete, for some of
        these may yet make all the difference. There is no going back - but
        there are dropped threads that can be woven into the onward story.
        </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        These strategies remind me quite a bit of the praxis of <a
        href="https://inkdroid.org/2025/08/23/permacomputing/">permacomputing</a>–determining
        what parts of the computing project can be useful to preserve, and what
        to let go of. I also identify with the fourth kind of work. As I’ve
        gotten older I’ve noticed that I gravitate towards finding value in how
        older ideas, that may have fallen out of fashion or come under
        criticism, have relevance and utility in the present, especially because
        of the way we can learn from the particular ways that they failed, or
        fell short.

      <title>Visual Features Across Modalities: SVG and ASCII Art Reveal Cross-Modal Understanding</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/25/visual-features-across-modalities/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/october-update/index.html#svg-cross-modal">Visual Features Across Modalities: SVG and ASCII Art Reveal Cross-Modal Understanding</a></strong></p>
        New model interpretability research from Anthropic, this time focused on SVG and ASCII art generation.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We found that the same feature that activates over the eyes in an ASCII face also activates for eyes across diverse text-based modalities, including SVG code and prose in various languages. This is not limited to eyes – we found a number of cross-modal features that recognize specific concepts: from small components like mouths and ears within ASCII or SVG faces, to full visual depictions like dogs and cats. [...]</p>
        <p>These features depend on the surrounding context within the visual depiction. For instance, an SVG circle element activates “eye” features only when positioned within a larger structure that activates “face” features.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And really, I can't <em>not</em> link to this one given the bonus they tagged on at the end!</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>As a bonus, we also inspected features for an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle">first popularized</a><a href="https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle"> by Simon Willison</a> as a way to test a model's artistic capabilities. We find features representing concepts including "bike", "wheels", "feet", "tail", "eyes", and "mouth" activating over the corresponding parts of the SVG code.</p>
        <p><img alt="Diagram showing a pelican riding a bicycle illustration alongside its SVG source code. The left side displays two versions: a completed color illustration at top with a white pelican with yellow beak on a red bicycle with blue wheels (labeled &quot;Bike&quot; and &quot;Wheels&quot;), and a line drawing sketch below with labels &quot;Fur/Wool&quot;, &quot;Eyes&quot;, &quot;Mouth&quot;, &quot;Tail&quot;, and &quot;Bird&quot;. The right side shows the corresponding SVG XML code with viewBox, rect, ellipse, circle, and path elements defining the illustration's geometry and styling." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/anthropic-pelican-bicycle.jpg" /></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now that they can identify model features associated with visual concepts in SVG images, can they us those for steering?</p>
        <p>It turns out they can! Starting with a smiley SVG (provided as XML with no indication as to what it was drawing) and then applying a negative score to the "smile" feature produced a frown instead, and worked against ASCII art as well.</p>

      <source:markdown>**[Visual Features Across Modalities: SVG and ASCII Art Reveal Cross-Modal Understanding](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/october-update/index.html#svg-cross-modal)**

New model interpretability research from Anthropic, this time focused on SVG and ASCII art generation.

&#62; We found that the same feature that activates over the eyes in an ASCII face also activates for eyes across diverse text-based modalities, including SVG code and prose in various languages. This is not limited to eyes – we found a number of cross-modal features that recognize specific concepts: from small components like mouths and ears within ASCII or SVG faces, to full visual depictions like dogs and cats. \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; These features depend on the surrounding context within the visual depiction. For instance, an SVG circle element activates “eye” features only when positioned within a larger structure that activates “face” features.

And really, I can&#39;t _not_ link to this one given the bonus they tagged on at the end!

&#62; As a bonus, we also inspected features for an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle, [first popularized](https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle) [by Simon Willison](https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle) as a way to test a model&#39;s artistic capabilities. We find features representing concepts including &#34;bike&#34;, &#34;wheels&#34;, &#34;feet&#34;, &#34;tail&#34;, &#34;eyes&#34;, and &#34;mouth&#34; activating over the corresponding parts of the SVG code.
&#62;
&#62; ![Diagram showing a pelican riding a bicycle illustration alongside its SVG source code. The left side displays two versions: a completed color illustration at top with a white pelican with yellow beak on a red bicycle with blue wheels (labeled &#34;Bike&#34; and &#34;Wheels&#34;), and a line drawing sketch below with labels &#34;Fur/Wool&#34;, &#34;Eyes&#34;, &#34;Mouth&#34;, &#34;Tail&#34;, and &#34;Bird&#34;. The right side shows the corresponding SVG XML code with viewBox, rect, ellipse, circle, and path elements defining the illustration&#39;s geometry and styling.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/anthropic-pelican-bicycle.jpg)

Now that they can identify model features associated with visual concepts in SVG images, can they us those for steering?

It turns out they can! Starting with a smiley SVG (provided as XML with no indication as to what it was drawing) and then applying a negative score to the &#34;smile&#34; feature produced a frown instead, and worked against ASCII art as well.

They could also boost features like unicorn, cat, owl, or lion and get new SVG smileys clearly attempting to depict those creatures.

&#62; ![Diagram showing a yellow smiley face in the center with bidirectional arrows connecting to six different circular faces arranged around it, with text above asking &#34;What can this face be steered into?&#34; The surrounding faces are labeled clockwise from top left: &#34;Unicorn&#34; (pink circle with yellow triangle horn and diamond earrings), &#34;Cat&#34; (gray circle with triangular ears and small nose), &#34;Wrinkles&#34; (beige circle with eyelashes and wrinkle lines), &#34;Owl&#34; (brown circle with large round eyes and small beak), &#34;Lion&#34; (orange circle with yellow inner face), and &#34;Eye&#34; (white circle with large black pupil and highlight](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/anthropic-faces.jpg)

I&#39;d love to see how this behaves if you jack up the feature for the [Golden Gate Bridge](https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/24/golden-gate-claude/).

        <p>I wish other LLM products - including both ChatGPT and Claude.ai themselves - would implement a similar pattern.

        <p>What's notable about this fix is that it came about when I was talking with people who work on the open source WordPress project at the WordCamp last week in Ottawa. One of them took an interest and puzzled it out and came up with a theory. When we tested the theory on the real data, it made a big difference. If it works in the deployed version as well as it did in the test, FeedLand will be better for this. </p>
        <p>Related, I've been asked if we'll share the subscription list for the WordPress News site, so this gives me a chance to show that any FeedLand-managed site, by default has a white-on-orange <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/24/wordpressNewsScreen.png">XML icon</a>. When you click on it, you'll see the <a href="https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=wordpress">OPML list</a> for the page you were looking at. The list is dynamic, so it changes whenever the set of feeds changes. This has become a huge part of the systems we've built with FeedLand, that's why you see apps that are deployed on one server using data from a different one. The federation protocol for FeedLand is a simple and well-established standard for sharing lists of feeds, OPML over HTTP. Kind of like RSS was when we were just getting started with feeds, it's how you plug systems together. Esp if you can take advantage of the fact they're all dynamic. Also that they work really well with categories. Lots to say about FeedLand. Glad we're turning this corner now. </p>

Now it’s my turn.

Last week I’m flying home.

My flight gets delayed in air, then lands late so I miss my connecting flight…

\[Skip over all the stuff about airline customer support, getting rebooked, etc.\]

It’s ~10pm and I’m stranded overnight. I need a last-minute hotel room.

I figure I’ll try HotelTonight because that’s their shtick, right? “Incredible last-minute hotel deals” says their homepage hero banner.

I find the closest hotel, click “Purchase” it takes me to checkout, I do the whole Apple Pay thing, then it says “failed to book” because there are no more rooms left.

Ok? Would’ve been nice to know that _before_ going through all the checkout stuff, but ok. I’ll find another.

Two more hotels, same deal. Click through, checkout, blah blah blah, payment won’t go through. It says there are no more rooms left.

No I’m getting frustrated. I’ll try one more time…

Same flow. Finally! Payment goes through. Confirmation number and all — I’m good to go!

I leave the airport and get a rideshare to the hotel.

Go up to the desk. “Yes, I’m checking in please.” They ask for my name. I give it.

They can’t find me.

“Oh, no…” I think.

“Do you have a reservation number?”

Hell yes I do! Right here in the email HotelTonight sent me.

I give it to them.

It’s not in their system.

“Ok well, can you get me a room?”

Nope, they are completely full for the night.

Knowing that I booked through a third-party system, and it’s not in the first-party system, I know there’s no chance I’m getting a room.

So now it’s 10:30pm. I’m in the lobby of the hotel for which I have a bogus confirmation and I begin my search for the next-closest hotel.

I just need to connect to a human at a front desk.

      <source:markdown>&#62; A lot of people say AI will make us all &#34;managers&#34; or &#34;editors&#34;...but I think this is a dangerously incomplete view!
&#62;
&#62; Personally, I&#39;m trying to **code like a surgeon**.
&#62;
&#62; A surgeon isn&#39;t a manager, they do the actual work! But their skills and time are highly leveraged with a support team that handles prep, secondary tasks, admin. The surgeon focuses on the important stuff they are uniquely good at. \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; It turns out there are a LOT of secondary tasks which AI agents are now good enough to help out with. Some things I&#39;m finding useful to hand off these days:
&#62;
&#62; - Before attempting a big task, write a guide to relevant areas of the codebase
&#62; - Spike out an attempt at a big change. Often I won&#39;t use the result but I&#39;ll review it as a sketch of where to go
&#62; - Fix typescript errors or bugs which have a clear specification

One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn&#39;t doing anything. I&#39;m lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: _why do some towers blink?_

Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, &#34;flashing&#34;, &#34;white light&#34;, or &#34;strobe&#34;. All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that&#39;s the purpose of it.

Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there&#39;s a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.

      <source:markdown>### _For October 14-21, 2025_

Hello and welcome to **A Newsletter of Humorous Writing**, a roundup of the week&#39;s finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Sorry this week’s edition is arriving a little bit late today! We got caught up in an “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie” situation, but instead of a cookie it was bagels, and instead of a mouse it was a particularly large and angry pigeon, and instead of “give” it was—look what we’re trying to say is we spent all day chasing around the pigeon that stole our breakfast.

## What We Enjoyed This Week

[**I Am Legally Obligated to Play Billy Joel’s “River of Dreams” at Least Once During Your Dental Appointment**](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/i-am-legally-obligated-to-play-billy-joels-river-of-dreams-at-least-once-during-your-dental-appointment?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) **by** [**Katie Mazza-Phillips**](https://bsky.app/profile/worldofktebs.bsky.social?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) _(McSweeney’s)_ Katie starts with an interesting observation (“What’s up with the music they play in dentists’ offices?”) and spins it into a terrific piece by making nice specific choices (Billy Joel’s “River of Dreams”) and by simply exploring the logic and logistics of her premise. (“Billy Joel’s people call every Saturday to ask your receptionist how many times you played ‘The River of Dreams’ in the office that week.”)

This instantly joins the pantheon of great humor pieces about Billy Joel. It’s an illustrious list that includes [Michael Ian Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ian_Black?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415)’s [What I Would Be Thinking About If I Were Billy Joel Driving Toward a Holiday Party Where I Knew There Was Going to Be a Piano](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/what-i-would-be-thinking-about-if-i-were-billy-joel-driving-toward-a-holiday-party-where-i-knew-there-was-going-to-be-a-piano?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) and [Felipe Torres Medina](https://www.felipetorresmedina.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) and [Dru Johnston](https://drujohnston.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415)’s [Beware the Piano-Man!](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/beware-the-piano-man?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) And for some great non-fiction about Billy Joel that is also often quite funny, check out [Nick Paumgarten](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/nick-paumgarten?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415)’s profile, [Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/billy-joel-profile-thirty-three-hit-wonder?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415).

[**So, You and the Pope Both Showed Up to This Party Wearing the Same Hat**](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/so-you-and-the-pope-both-showed-up-to-this-party-wearing-the-same-hat?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) **by** [**Tyler Gooch**](https://tylergoo.ch/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) _(McSweeney’s)_ This absurd situation is such a funny setup, and Tyler does a tremendous job exploring and heightening that situation as the piece goes on. This one goes to some truly unexpected places, but all the heightening is completely earned.

[**Quiz: How much of a real New Yorker are you?**](https://nygroove.nyc/real-new-yorker-quiz/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) **by** [**New York Groove Staff**](https://nygroove.nyc/about/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) _(The New York Groove)_ This isn’t just a delightfully wacky quiz packed with fun New York City specifics, it’s also a spot-on satire of New Yorkers’ tendency to try to one-up each other about who’s got more of a connection to the city.

      <title>AI Browsers: Living on the Frontier of Security</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/ai-browsers-frontier-security/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI released their new <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-10-22T1238" >“browser”</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/" >Simon Willison has the deets on its security</a>, going point-by-point through the statement from OpenAI’s Chief Information Security Officer. His post is great if you want to dive on the details. Here’s my high-level takeaway:</p>
        <p>Everything OpenAI <em>says</em> they are doing to mitigate the security concerns of an LLM paired with a browser sounds reasonable in theory. However, as their CISO says, “prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem”. So unless you want to be part of what is essentially a global experiment on the frontier of security on the internet, you might want to wait before you consider any of their promises “meaningful mitigation”.</p>
        <p>(Aside: Let’s put people on the “frontier” of security for their daily tasks, that seems totally fine right? Meanwhile, Tom MacWright has rationally argued that <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/05/29/putting-an-untrusted-chat-layer-is-a-disaster" >putting an AI chatbot between users and the internet is an obvious disaster we’ll all recognize as such one day</a>.)</p>
        <p>What really strikes me after reading Simon’s article is the intersection of these two topics which have garnered a lot of attention as of late:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>npm supply chain attacks</li>
        <li>AI browsers</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This intersection seems <em>primed</em> for exploitation, especially if you consider combining different techniques we’ve seen as of late like <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/weaponizing-ai-coding-agents-for-malware-in-the-nx-malicious-package/" >weaponizing LLM agents</a> and <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/npm-risks/" >shipping malicious code that only runs in end-users’ browsers</a>.</p>
        <p>Imagine, for a second, something like the following:</p>
        <p>You’re an attacker and you stick malicious instructions — not code, mind you, just plain-text English language prose — in your otherwise helpful lib and let people install it.</p>
        <p>No malicious code is run on the installing computer.</p>
        <p>Bundlers then combine third-party dependencies with first-party code in order to spit it out application code which gets shipped to end users.</p>
        <p>At this point, there is still zero malicious code that has executed on anyone’s computer.</p>
        <p>Then, end users w/AI browsers end up consuming these plain-text instructions that are part of your application bundle and boom, you’ve been exploited.</p>
        <p>At no point was any “malicious code” written by a bad actor “executed” by the browser engine itself. Rather, it’s the bolted on AI agent running alongside the browser engine that ingests these instructions and does something it obviously shouldn’t.</p>
        <p>In other words: it doesn’t have to be code to be an exploit. Plain-text human language is now a weaponizable exploit, which means the surface for attacks just got way bigger.</p>

His post is great if you want to dive on the details. Here’s my high-level takeaway:

Everything OpenAI _says_ they are doing to mitigate the security concerns of an LLM paired with a browser sounds reasonable in theory. However, as their CISO says, “prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem”. So unless you want to be part of what is essentially a global experiment on the frontier of security on the internet, you might want to wait before you consider any of their promises “meaningful mitigation”.

What really strikes me after reading Simon’s article is the intersection of these two topics which have garnered a lot of attention as of late:

1. npm supply chain attacks
2. AI browsers

This intersection seems _primed_ for exploitation, especially if you consider combining different techniques we’ve seen as of late like [weaponizing LLM agents](https://snyk.io/blog/weaponizing-ai-coding-agents-for-malware-in-the-nx-malicious-package/) and [shipping malicious code that only runs in end-users’ browsers](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/npm-risks/).

Imagine, for a second, something like the following:

You’re an attacker and you stick malicious instructions — not code, mind you, just plain-text English language prose — in your otherwise helpful lib and let people install it.

No malicious code is run on the installing computer.

Bundlers then combine third-party dependencies with first-party code in order to spit it out application code which gets shipped to end users.

At this point, there is still zero malicious code that has executed on anyone’s computer.

Then, end users w/AI browsers end up consuming these plain-text instructions that are part of your application bundle and boom, you’ve been exploited.

At no point was any “malicious code” written by a bad actor “executed” by the browser engine itself. Rather, it’s the bolted on AI agent running alongside the browser engine that ingests these instructions and does something it obviously shouldn’t.

In other words: it doesn’t have to be code to be an exploit. Plain-text human language is now a weaponizable exploit, which means the surface for attacks just got way bigger.

      <link>http://scripting.com/2025/10/23/133525.html?title=thinkDifferentAboutDevelopers</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Tell the people who make AI's -- I want a way to have apps run in your browser that has direct connections to the AI engine, and it connects via the user's credentials, not the app devs (though you are entitled to know who the developer is). When I explored the idea of making apps for ChatGPT, this was the roadblock, I have to become a reseller of your service. Can't you figure out how to let the user pay directly? I just want to make tools, not be in the retail AI business. Feh.</p>
        <p>This is the same problem web devs have, we have to become resellers for Amazon S3.

      <source:markdown>Tell the people who make AI&#39;s -- I want a way to have apps run in your browser that has direct connections to the AI engine, and it connects via the user&#39;s credentials, not the app devs (though you are entitled to know who the developer is). When I explored the idea of making apps for ChatGPT, this was the roadblock, I have to become a reseller of your service. Can&#39;t you figure out how to let the user pay directly? I just want to make tools, not be in the retail AI business. Feh.

This is the same problem web devs have, we have to become resellers for Amazon S3. Why can&#39;t Amazon, who already has an account for every freaking person in the world, let the user own their own data, which I believe they would _reallllly_ like. I don&#39;t want access to it, I just want to make great tools for them to use. And they&#39;re free to use other products with the data. This helps encourage data format standards. It&#39;s why the PC software market was so much more vibrant than the web developer market.

I keep trying to explain this to people who aren&#39;t web devs, but in a position to help, and make a shitload of money, but all I get is blank stares, and &#34;we don&#39;t do that.&#34;</source:markdown>

        <p>My auto-blocking of bots hasn’t needed much intervention in recent weeks. The
        current average is 10,000 blocked IP ranges.
        If you&rsquo;re interested, there&rsquo;s a
        <a href="https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index">a description of my setup</a>.</p>

        <p>Hah, I post the above and now load is 95 and the bots are at it.</p>
        
        <p>What I don’t like about Munin is that when it crashes (I assume it’s the OOM
        reaper making the rounds), then it leaves behind a lock that prevents the
        graph from updating. Ugh.</p>

        <p>If you like large language models (LLMs), know that they need regular
        training and the people training them are ruining the web for
        everybody. You are part of this, as a consumer.</p>
        
        <p>Most sites don’t have the defences required, or require the execution
        of expensive JavaScript for the CO₂ god, or require placing all your
        visitor’s browsing data into the hands of another company, most likely
        CloudFlare, in the USA. If you object to any of that, you must do your
        duty and reject the use of LLMs as well. You can’t eat your cake and
        claim to object to the rest. It would be a most incongruent position
        to take.</p>
        
        <p>And since this kind of shit often happens while

        consequences by time and space like to choose comfort. In this case,
        the AI comfort leads to the shut down of the open web, the
        centralisation of what remains, the installation of barriers, and ever
        and always: more control for fewer people. But of course, the

      <source:markdown># 2025-10-22 Bots, again. I’m taking it personally.

My auto-blocking of bots hasn’t needed much intervention in recent weeks. The
current average is 10,000 blocked IP ranges.
If you’re interested, there’s a
[a description of my setup](https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index).

![Lots of graphs but the important one is the yellow line that’s pretty stable around 10k.](2025-10-22-bots-again/01K7RMQ3YVE09T7ZYGSNEMBH1H.png)

Hah, I post the above and now load is 95 and the bots are at it.

What I don’t like about Munin is that when it crashes (I assume it’s the OOM
reaper making the rounds), then it leaves behind a lock that prevents the
graph from updating. Ugh.

![A Munin graph showing maximum average load being 137.51 and now back to 1.24.](2025-10-22-bots-again/01K7YKFAPMFGSC0F8EBRSM66YJ.png)

If you like large language models (LLMs), know that they need regular
training and the people training them are ruining the web for
everybody. You are part of this, as a consumer.

Most sites don’t have the defences required, or require the execution
of expensive JavaScript for the CO₂ god, or require placing all your
visitor’s browsing data into the hands of another company, most likely
CloudFlare, in the USA. If you object to any of that, you must do your
duty and reject the use of LLMs as well. You can’t eat your cake and
claim to object to the rest. It would be a most incongruent position
to take.

And since this kind of shit often happens while
[I’m on holidays](2025-portugal), the LLM friends reading this are
responsible, in a very small way, for pissing on me during my
holidays. And I resent it.

I resent it very much.

![Load going up to 80, again. And back down, again.](2025-10-22-bots-again/01K7YXF66MYSEQC615WGSBECN2.png)

Waking up in a hotel bed, opening the balcony doors, hearing the birds
sing, switching on the phone and realising that load is over 100 and
nothing works, switching off Emacs Wiki and Community Wiki, the
favourite targets of the AI scrapers and thinking of the people who
like to use large language models.

It’s the same problem as always: drive a car, see the CO₂ in the world
go up, “but I need it!” – yeah, but we need an earth that supports
human life too, idiots. Humans, where comfort is separated from
consequences by time and space like to choose comfort. In this case,
the AI comfort leads to the shut down of the open web, the
centralisation of what remains, the installation of barriers, and ever
and always: more control for fewer people. But of course, the
consequences are separated by time and space from the comforts of AI
users.

Imagine a goddess of destruction with a grim smile and a thousand
hands and each one of them is giving you a middle finger.

Load average: 142.25

I switched off Community Wiki and Emacs Wiki.

Coming back after a day of excursions and things seem to be working
fine, if I don’t switch on those two sites. These two have been
unavailable for a minimum of six hours and yet in the last two hours
Emacs Wiki still got 3537 requests.

Time to ban every network of every ASN that’s still requesting Emacs Wiki pages.

```
2h-access-log \
| grep &#39;^www\.emacswiki\.org&#39; \
| log-ip \
| asncounter --top 50 --no-prefixes 2&#62;/dev/null \

| xargs asn-networks \
| xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad-week banip

```

If you’re looking for the building blocks I’m using, see my
[collection of admin scripts and shell functions](https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/).

Hours later, I switched Emacs Wiki on for a minute and load
immediately rose from around 1 to nearly 4 and my SSH connection
became slow as molasses. It’ll remain switched off for tonight and
probably tomorrow, too. It depends on the kind of wifi connection I
have, tomorrow.

Perhaps I should just hand Emacs Wiki off to somebody who’s more into
it.

Switching off Community Wiki and two smaller sites as well, for now.

**2025-10-22**. On IRC, twb replied to my complaints about the Munin lock being left behind:

&#62; if you have systemd, just set RuntimeDirectory=%p and systemd will clean it up

Also, he’s running [collection4](https://github.com/trentbuck/collection4/blob/main/debian/service) instead of Munin.

**2025-10-23**. Switching Emacs Wiki back on, about nine hours ago.

This is a relief:

&#62; Federal judge Ona T. Wang filed a new order on October 9 that frees OpenAI of an obligation to &#34;preserve and segregate all output log data that would otherwise be deleted on a going forward basis.&#34;

I wrote about this [in June](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/5/openai-court-order/). OpenAI were compelled by a court order to preserve _all_ output, even from private chats, in case it became relevant to the ongoing New York Times lawsuit.

Here are those &#34;some exceptions&#34;:

&#62; The judge in the case said that any chat logs already saved under the previous order would still be accessible and that OpenAI is required to hold on to any data related to ChatGPT accounts that have been flagged by the NYT.

        <![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I was manually converting a terminal session into a shared HTML file for the umpteenth time when I decided to reduce the friction by building a custom tool for it - and on the spur of the moment I fired up <a href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a> to record the process. The result is this new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQvMLLrFPVI">11 minute YouTube video</a> showing my workflow for vibe-coding simple tools from start to finish.</p>

        <h4 id="the-initial-problem">The initial problem</h4>
        <p>The problem I wanted to solve involves sharing my Claude Code CLI sessions - and the more general problem of sharing interesting things that happen in my terminal.</p>
        <p>A while back I discovered (using my vibe-coded <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/clipboard-viewer">clipboard inspector</a>) that copying and pasting from the macOS terminal populates a rich text clipboard format which preserves the colors and general formatting of the terminal output.</p>
        <p>The problem is that format looks like this:</p>
        <pre><code>{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2859
        \cocoatextscaling0\cocoaplatform0{\fonttbl\f0\fnil\fcharset0 Monaco;}
        {\colortbl;\red255\green255\blue255;\red242\green242\blue242;\red0\green0\blue0;\red204\green98\blue70;
        \red0\green0\blue0;\red97\green97\blue97;\red102\green102\blue102;\red255\
        </code></pre>
        <p>This struck me as the kind of thing an LLM might be able to write code to parse, so I had <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/680801ad-0804-8006-83fc-c2b209841a9c">ChatGPT take a crack at it</a> and then later <a href="https://claude.ai/share/5c12dd0e-713d-4f32-a6c1-d05dee353e4d">rewrote it from scratch with Claude Sonnet 4.5</a>. The result was <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html">this rtf-to-html tool</a> which lets you paste in rich formatted text and gives you reasonably solid HTML that you can share elsewhere.</p>
        <p>To share that HTML I've started habitually pasting it into a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gist</a> and then taking advantage of <code>gitpreview.github.io</code>, a neat little unofficial tool that accepts <code>?GIST_ID</code> and displays the gist content as a standalone HTML page... which means you can link to rendered HTML that's stored in a gist.</p>
        <p>So my process was:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Copy terminal output</li>
        <li>Paste into <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html">rtf-to-html</a>
        </li>
        <li>Copy resulting HTML</li>
        <li>Paste that int a new GitHub Gist</li>
        <li>Grab that Gist's ID</li>
        <li>Share the link to <code>gitpreview.github.io?GIST_ID</code>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Not too much hassle, but frustratingly manual if you're doing it several times a day.</p>
        <h4 id="the-desired-solution">The desired solution</h4>
        <p>Ideally I want a tool where I can do this:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Copy terminal output</li>
        <li>Paste into a new tool</li>
        <li>Click a button and get a <code>gistpreview</code> link to share</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I decided to get Claude Code for web to build the entire thing.</p>
        <h4 id="the-prompt">The prompt</h4>
        <p>Here's the full prompt I used on <a href="https://claude.ai/code">claude.ai/code</a>, pointed at my <code>simonw/tools</code> repo, to build the tool:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Build a new tool called terminal-to-html which lets the user copy RTF directly from their terminal and paste it into a paste area, it then produces the HTML version of that in a textarea with a copy button, below is a button that says "Save this to a Gist", and below that is a full preview. It will be very similar to the existing rtf-to-html.html tool but it doesn't show the raw RTF and it has that Save this to a Gist button</code></p>
        <p><code>That button should do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does, with the same use of localStorage and the same flow to get users signed in with a token if they are not already</code></p>
        <p><code>So click the button, it asks the user to sign in if necessary, then it saves that HTML to a Gist in a file called index.html, gets back the Gist ID and shows the user the URL https://gistpreview.github.io/?6d778a8f9c4c2c005a189ff308c3bc47 - but with their gist ID in it</code></p>
        <p><code>They can see the URL, they can click it (do not use target="_blank") and there is also a "Copy URL" button to copy it to their clipboard</code></p>
        <p><code>Make the UI mobile friendly but also have it be courier green-text-on-black themed to reflect what it does</code></p>
        <p><code>If the user pastes and the pasted data is available as HTML but not as RTF skip the RTF step and process the HTML directly</code></p>
        <p><code>If the user pastes and it's only available as plain text then generate HTML that is just an open &lt;pre&gt; tag and their text and a closing &lt;/pre&gt; tag</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's quite a long prompt - it took me several minutes to type! But it covered the functionality I wanted in enough detail that I was pretty confident Claude would be able to build it.</p>
        <h4 id="combining">Combining previous tools</h4>
        <p>I'm using one key technique in this prompt: I'm referencing existing tools in the same repo and telling Claude to imitate their functionality.</p>
        <p>I first wrote about this trick last March in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser</a>, where I described how a snippet of code that used PDF.js and another snippet that used Tesseract.js was enough for Claude 3 Opus to build me this <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr">working PDF OCR tool</a>. That was actually the tool that kicked off my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> collection in the first place, which has since grown to 139 and counting.</p>
        <p>Here I'm telling Claude that I want the RTF to HTML functionality of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/rtf-to-html.html">rtf-to-html.html</a> combined with the Gist saving functionality of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/openai-audio-output.html">openai-audio-output.html</a>.</p>
        <p>That one has quite a bit going on. It uses the OpenAI audio API to generate audio output from a text prompt, which is returned by that API as base64-encoded data in JSON.</p>
        <p>Then it offers the user a button to save that JSON to a Gist, which gives the snippet a URL.</p>
        <p>Another tool I wrote, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/gpt-4o-audio-player.html">gpt-4o-audio-player.html</a>, can then accept that Gist ID in the URL and will fetch the JSON data and make the audio playable in the browser. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/gpt-4o-audio-player?gist=4a982d3fe7ba8cb4c01e89c69a4a5335">Here's an example</a>.</p>
        <p>The trickiest part of this is API tokens. I've built tools in the past that require users to paste in a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) (which I then store in <code>localStorage</code> in their browser - I don't want other people's authentication credentials anywhere near my own servers). But that's a bit fiddly.</p>
        <p>Instead, I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/975b8934066417fe771561a1b672ad4f">figured out</a> the minimal Cloudflare worker necessary to implement the server-side portion of GitHub's authentication flow. That code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/cloudflare-workers/github-auth.js">lives here</a> and means that any of the HTML+JavaScript tools in my collection can implement a GitHub authentication flow if they need to save Gists.</p>
        <p>But I don't have to tell the model any of that! I can just say "do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does" and Claude Code will work the rest out for itself.</p>
        <h4 id="the-result">The result</h4>
        <p>Here's what <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html">the resulting app</a> looks like after I've pasted in some terminal output from Claude Code CLI:</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>This afternoon I was manually converting a terminal session into a shared HTML file for the umpteenth time when I decided to reduce the friction by building a custom tool for it - and on the spur of the moment I fired up [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) to record the process. The result is this new [11 minute YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQvMLLrFPVI) showing my workflow for vibe-coding simple tools from start to finish.

#### The initial problem

The problem I wanted to solve involves sharing my Claude Code CLI sessions - and the more general problem of sharing interesting things that happen in my terminal.

A while back I discovered (using my vibe-coded [clipboard inspector](https://tools.simonwillison.net/clipboard-viewer)) that copying and pasting from the macOS terminal populates a rich text clipboard format which preserves the colors and general formatting of the terminal output.

The problem is that format looks like this:

```
{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2859
\cocoatextscaling0\cocoaplatform0{\fonttbl\f0\fnil\fcharset0 Monaco;}
{\colortbl;\red255\green255\blue255;\red242\green242\blue242;\red0\green0\blue0;\red204\green98\blue70;
\red0\green0\blue0;\red97\green97\blue97;\red102\green102\blue102;\red255\

```

This struck me as the kind of thing an LLM might be able to write code to parse, so I had [ChatGPT take a crack at it](https://chatgpt.com/share/680801ad-0804-8006-83fc-c2b209841a9c) and then later [rewrote it from scratch with Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://claude.ai/share/5c12dd0e-713d-4f32-a6c1-d05dee353e4d). The result was [this rtf-to-html tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html) which lets you paste in rich formatted text and gives you reasonably solid HTML that you can share elsewhere.

To share that HTML I&#39;ve started habitually pasting it into a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and then taking advantage of `gitpreview.github.io`, a neat little unofficial tool that accepts `?GIST_ID` and displays the gist content as a standalone HTML page... which means you can link to rendered HTML that&#39;s stored in a gist.

So my process was:

1. Copy terminal output
2. Paste into [rtf-to-html](https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html)
3. Copy resulting HTML
4. Paste that int a new GitHub Gist
5. Grab that Gist&#39;s ID
6. Share the link to `gitpreview.github.io?GIST_ID`

Not too much hassle, but frustratingly manual if you&#39;re doing it several times a day.

#### The desired solution

Ideally I want a tool where I can do this:

1. Copy terminal output
2. Paste into a new tool
3. Click a button and get a `gistpreview` link to share

I decided to get Claude Code for web to build the entire thing.

#### The prompt

Here&#39;s the full prompt I used on [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code), pointed at my `simonw/tools` repo, to build the tool:

&#62; `Build a new tool called terminal-to-html which lets the user copy RTF directly from their terminal and paste it into a paste area, it then produces the HTML version of that in a textarea with a copy button, below is a button that says &#34;Save this to a Gist&#34;, and below that is a full preview. It will be very similar to the existing rtf-to-html.html tool but it doesn&#39;t show the raw RTF and it has that Save this to a Gist button`
&#62;
&#62; `That button should do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does, with the same use of localStorage and the same flow to get users signed in with a token if they are not already`
&#62;
&#62; `So click the button, it asks the user to sign in if necessary, then it saves that HTML to a Gist in a file called index.html, gets back the Gist ID and shows the user the URL https://gistpreview.github.io/?6d778a8f9c4c2c005a189ff308c3bc47 - but with their gist ID in it`
&#62;
&#62; `They can see the URL, they can click it (do not use target=&#34;_blank&#34;) and there is also a &#34;Copy URL&#34; button to copy it to their clipboard`
&#62;
&#62; `Make the UI mobile friendly but also have it be courier green-text-on-black themed to reflect what it does`
&#62;
&#62; `If the user pastes and the pasted data is available as HTML but not as RTF skip the RTF step and process the HTML directly`
&#62;
&#62; `If the user pastes and it&#39;s only available as plain text then generate HTML that is just an open &#60;pre&#62; tag and their text and a closing &#60;/pre&#62; tag`

It&#39;s quite a long prompt - it took me several minutes to type! But it covered the functionality I wanted in enough detail that I was pretty confident Claude would be able to build it.

#### Combining previous tools

I&#39;m using one key technique in this prompt: I&#39;m referencing existing tools in the same repo and telling Claude to imitate their functionality.

I first wrote about this trick last March in [Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/), where I described how a snippet of code that used PDF.js and another snippet that used Tesseract.js was enough for Claude 3 Opus to build me this [working PDF OCR tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr). That was actually the tool that kicked off my [tools.simonwillison.net](https://tools.simonwillison.net/) collection in the first place, which has since grown to 139 and counting.

Here I&#39;m telling Claude that I want the RTF to HTML functionality of [rtf-to-html.html](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/rtf-to-html.html) combined with the Gist saving functionality of [openai-audio-output.html](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/openai-audio-output.html).

That one has quite a bit going on. It uses the OpenAI audio API to generate audio output from a text prompt, which is returned by that API as base64-encoded data in JSON.

Then it offers the user a button to save that JSON to a Gist, which gives the snippet a URL.

Another tool I wrote, [gpt-4o-audio-player.html](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/gpt-4o-audio-player.html), can then accept that Gist ID in the URL and will fetch the JSON data and make the audio playable in the browser. [Here&#39;s an example](https://tools.simonwillison.net/gpt-4o-audio-player?gist=4a982d3fe7ba8cb4c01e89c69a4a5335).

The trickiest part of this is API tokens. I&#39;ve built tools in the past that require users to paste in a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) (which I then store in `localStorage` in their browser - I don&#39;t want other people&#39;s authentication credentials anywhere near my own servers). But that&#39;s a bit fiddly.

Instead, I [figured out](https://gist.github.com/simonw/975b8934066417fe771561a1b672ad4f) the minimal Cloudflare worker necessary to implement the server-side portion of GitHub&#39;s authentication flow. That code [lives here](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/cloudflare-workers/github-auth.js) and means that any of the HTML+JavaScript tools in my collection can implement a GitHub authentication flow if they need to save Gists.

But I don&#39;t have to tell the model any of that! I can just say &#34;do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does&#34; and Claude Code will work the rest out for itself.

#### The result

Here&#39;s what [the resulting app](https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html) looks like after I&#39;ve pasted in some terminal output from Claude Code CLI:

![Terminal to HTML app. Green glowing text on black. Instructions: Paste terminal output below. Supports RTF, HTML or plain text. There&#39;s an HTML Code area with a Copy HTML button, Save this to a Gist and a bunch of HTML. Below is the result of save to a gist showing a URL and a Copy URL button. Below that a preview with the Claude Code heading in ASCII art.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/terminal-to-html.jpg)

It&#39;s exactly what I asked for, and the green-on-black terminal aesthetic is spot on too.

#### Other notes from the video

There are a bunch of other things that I touch on in the video. Here&#39;s a quick summary:

- [tools.simonwillison.net/colophon](https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon) is the list of all of my tools, with accompanying AI-generated descriptions. Here&#39;s [more about how I built that with Claude Code](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/#a-detailed-example) and notes on [how I added the AI-generated descriptions](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/tools-colophon/).
- [gistpreview.github.io](https://gistpreview.github.io) is really neat.
- I used [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) to record and edit the video. I&#39;m still getting the hang of it - hence the slightly clumsy pan-and-zoom - but it&#39;s pretty great for this kind of screen recording.
- The site&#39;s automated deploys are managed [by this GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yml). I also have it configured to work with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for those preview deployments from PRs (here&#39;s [an example](https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/84#issuecomment-3434969331)).
- The automated documentation is created using my [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/) tool and [llm-anthropic](https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic) plugin. Here&#39;s [the script that does that](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/write_docs.py), recently [upgraded](https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/99f5f2713f8001b72f4b1cafee5a15c0c26efb0d) to use Claude Haiku 4.5.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Another hot Fall in Texas. No notable rain since June. Air-conditioning humming. Water bill up. Backyard is a dust bowl from the dogs tearing up all the grass.</p>
        <p>My schedule is a constant loop of kid activities; school, cheer, baseball, guitar, birthday parties, randomized school holidays, etc. I call it “The Luge”. A family bobsled ride downhill with no meaningful breaks until Christmas. There’s been some real highlights like nights at the ballpark, singing through the K-Pop Demon Slayers album with a car full of girlie-pop tweenagers, and watching my son play his first rock show. But personally, there’s been an overwhelming cloud through it all.</p>
        <h2>I’ve been grumpy, like super grumpy</h2>
        <p>I’ve been in an incurably foul mood for the last month. I’m almost not sure this vibe-check is worth putting out into the world, but not all seasons in life are bangers. If you want to avoid the mire of my emotional dysfunction, feel free to bounce on this post.</p>
        <p>I think what compounds this problem is that I feel this isn’t my natural state (despite what my resting scowl would suggest). Sure there’s bouts of depression and some generalized anxiety mixed in there, but it feels against my core.</p>
        <h2>Politics, ugchk</h2>
        <p>If you’re a person who can divorce the rise of authoritarianism from your day-to-day emotional well-being… wow. I’m not that person. Each day unveils a new horror of economic anxiety, children being zip-tied in raids, parents abducted in school drive lines, dark money funding open corruption, feckless judges, and meme-driven political discourse. This administration adds a lime green background of radioactive stress to my life.</p>
        <p>Anyways, this whole situation is contributing to my bad mood.</p>
        <h2>Hypertense</h2>
        <p>I’m still untangling the Gordian Knot of stress, weight, and ADHD in my life. I switched my ADHD meds over the summer to “baby meth”. <a href="https://media.tenor.com/HnYy_rC8SaQAAAAi/pokemon-super-effective.gif">It’s super effective!</a> But that change triggered some heightened concern from my doctors about my blood pressure.</p>

        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/45g0s5b">The Dawn of Everything</a> <small>★★★★½</small> - A wonderful book that really reprogrammed a lot of inherent biases I had about “uncivilized” cultures. I never viewed Native Americans as “savages” like the history books and cowboy movies want you to believe, but… primitive? I’m almost embarassed to admit that this is what I thought anyways until I read this book and realized they were quite civilized and more advanced than us on many levels (civically and emotionally), operating on a different rule book entirely. It makes you wonder if society, without its kings, could function differently.</p>

Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu</a> <small>★★★★</small> - I saw this book on the shelf at Kinokuniya and it called to me… it called to me saying… Cthulu Fhtagn. A manga adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu. This is my first time dipping my toe into Lovecraftian space horror and to be honest, the manga version was probably the best for me. I don’t think I would have followed or enjoyed the flashback sequences set in 1920’s rhetoric, but in manga form I was able to follow along and see the story weave together. I’m on the fence if I’ll buy more, but was was enjoyable enough that I might. The art is incredible and dark.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/4neUXcH">Separation of Church and Hate</a> <small>★★★★</small> - A dig into how American Christianity is actually quite the opposite of what the Bible says. Not just some of the time, but lots of the time. If you find American Imperialist Christianity doesn’t fit your world view or your family is full of evangelical fundamentalists… this book is worth reading. One issue I had with the book –that I’ve had with books by other comedians– is when the author runs out of content, they resort to a series of one-liners to fill a chapter. It takes me out of the non-fiction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/4o6K7XC">Extra Focus</a> <small>★★★★</small> - Short n’ sweet. Probably the best book I’ve read on Adult ADHD and how it impacts our time, memory, and emotional management. The major themes are all followed by a tactical “guide” chapter which has tips and tricks like creating launchpads, setting timers, or posting a sticky by the job that needs to be done. Basic advice but feels like a best-of-the-best distillation of all the brainhacks out there.</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>Another hot Fall in Texas. No notable rain since June. Air-conditioning humming. Water bill up. Backyard is a dust bowl from the dogs tearing up all the grass.

My schedule is a constant loop of kid activities; school, cheer, baseball, guitar, birthday parties, randomized school holidays, etc. I call it “The Luge”. A family bobsled ride downhill with no meaningful breaks until Christmas. There’s been some real highlights like nights at the ballpark, singing through the K-Pop Demon Slayers album with a car full of girlie-pop tweenagers, and watching my son play his first rock show. But personally, there’s been an overwhelming cloud through it all.

## I’ve been grumpy, like super grumpy

I’ve been in an incurably foul mood for the last month. I’m almost not sure this vibe-check is worth putting out into the world, but not all seasons in life are bangers. If you want to avoid the mire of my emotional dysfunction, feel free to bounce on this post.

I think what compounds this problem is that I feel this isn’t my natural state (despite what my resting scowl would suggest). Sure there’s bouts of depression and some generalized anxiety mixed in there, but it feels against my core.

## Politics, ugchk

If you’re a person who can divorce the rise of authoritarianism from your day-to-day emotional well-being… wow. I’m not that person. Each day unveils a new horror of economic anxiety, children being zip-tied in raids, parents abducted in school drive lines, dark money funding open corruption, feckless judges, and meme-driven political discourse. This administration adds a lime green background of radioactive stress to my life.

Anyways, this whole situation is contributing to my bad mood.

## Hypertense

I’m still untangling the Gordian Knot of stress, weight, and ADHD in my life. I switched my ADHD meds over the summer to “baby meth”. [It’s super effective!](https://media.tenor.com/HnYy_rC8SaQAAAAi/pokemon-super-effective.gif) But that change triggered some heightened concern from my doctors about my blood pressure.

Ten years ago, I got diagnosed with White Coat Syndrome; a condition where your body panics around anyone in a lab coat and your blood pressure skyrockets. Whether it’s doctors, dentists, optometrists –you name it– I can see their eyes pop out of their head when the little arm cuff says “This person will probably die in this chair.”

My doctor didn’t want to roll the dice on “probably not dying.” He prescribed hypertension medicine which is medicine you’re on for the rest of your life unless some radical life change event happens; extreme weight-loss, becoming vegan (?), a trust fund appears, etc.

Without oversharing here, the psychological aspect of this is the hardest. There’s a feeling of shame attached to it that I’ve fucked my body up by being a sedentary computer boy; like I’ve sacrificed my body for capitalism and now I get to use capitalism and the inefficient American healthcare system to buy the cure. Ugh. But it could also be genetic. Who knows.

The initial battery of tests didn’t come back as hoped. Also the medicine… [It’s not very effective](https://media1.tenor.com/m/DJGWQIVi7G4AAAAC/pokemon-not-very-effective.gif). A week later I was lying on a table having my kidneys scanned and arteries measured. Thankfully, it wasn’t renal hypertension (or damage/failure) but a small part of me wanted to be at the end of the medical mystery journey. Still don’t know the root cause yet, so I’ll try that radical life change approach.

Anyways, this whole situation is contributing to my bad mood.

## Working out and hydrating

Pursuing radical change, I decided to set up that bike trainer I bought during the pandemic. The weather is nice enough now I can be in the garage without dying of heat stroke. As a result, I’ve managed to ride my bike nearly every day for the past month.

I’m abusing an old ADHD trick called “Task Pairing” to make it happen. [It’s super effective!](https://media.tenor.com/HnYy_rC8SaQAAAAi/pokemon-super-effective.gif) I pair something I _need to do_ (workout) with something I _want to do_ (watch YouTubes). I do this with washing dishes while I listen to audiobooks. Now instead of doomscrolling in my recliner… I’m doomscrolling on my bike, baby! What an improvement! Other than a sore coccyx, I could probably sit on the bike for hours. A nice unlock and a guilt-free way to enjoy brain rot.

But there’s the twist! After a month of riding my bike I’ve lost …. 0 pounds! I’m actually up two-to-five pounds from where I started. 😵‍💫 Someone suggested dehydration might be the problem so that day I bought one of those dumb water bottles that has timestamps on the side with encouraging affirmations that say “7:00am - Get to it”, “9:00am - Be your best”, “11:00am - You go, girl!” Hydration is great and all, but in practice it means frequent work and sleep interruptions for trips to the bathroom.

The key takeaway here is that Calories-In/Calories-Out is a fucking lie. Fuck that fat-phobic shit right into the sun. Even if it worked for you. Fuck it. Fuck it right off.

Anyways, this whole situation is contributing to my bad mood.

## Artificially-induced psychosis?

We’re being “encouraged” ( _ahem_) to use AI at work more and while I appreciate the opportunity to learn and explore, it’s chipping away at my mental health a bit. The prompt → wait → disappointment loop is dealing a form of psychic damage over time. Initial demos are a dopamine hit, but over time the context window dependably explodes. I’m not here to be a hater –if anything I’m genuinely curious about what these new fangled machines can do– but sometimes it feels like that episode of Star Trek where the Cardassians kidnapped Picard and put him in a room with four lights and told him to say there were five lights but Picard kept saying there were four lights… y’know like that. Mix in a couple projects growing in complexity and it adds up.

Anyways, this whole situation is contributing to my bad mood.

## The root cause and the probable cure

I think the common thread of everything from “The Luge” to me threatening a genius computer with its life is the loss of autonomy in my schedule, my nation, my body, and my work. In Daniel Pink’s book _Drive_ he describes the three pillars that drive people to perform at their best: autonomy, mastery, and purpose… those are all sorely lacking right now. That’s my best guess for why I’ve been in such a foul mood.

This past week I’ve hung out with friends in-person and online and that seems to have improved my mood considerably. Diner breakfast with seasonal pumpkin pancakes with my friend Zach. A small collaboration with the Frost Brothers on a big thing they’re working on. A birthday party for my friend Taylor featuring a bunch of old camping buddies admiring how our kids are all grown up now. Those connections are meaningful.

Anyways, I hope you’re doing better.

## Lifeloggers hate this one weird trick…

Can you believe I’ve done forty of these vibe checks? Well here you go you number perverts.

### 💪 **Health and Fitness**

I’ve worked out everyday for the last month and lost zero pounds. That’s demoralizing. I am happy that I’ve found a form of exercise that works for my mind and body –at least for now. Task pairing my negative-impact YouTube habit with a positive-impact exercise habit feels like I’m creating a balance in the world in a local-cosmic sense.

My blood pressure is going down a bit too and it’s probably worth celebrating small wins… by getting a milkshake.

- Win Every Argument★★★★ \- Former MSNBC anchor Medhi Hasan shares some Oxford debate club knowledge on how to convincingly argue your point and back it up with receipts.

- [The Dawn of Everything](https://amzn.to/45g0s5b) ★★★★½ \- A wonderful book that really reprogrammed a lot of inherent biases I had about “uncivilized” cultures. I never viewed Native Americans as “savages” like the history books and cowboy movies want you to believe, but… primitive? I’m almost embarassed to admit that this is what I thought anyways until I read this book and realized they were quite civilized and more advanced than us on many levels (civically and emotionally), operating on a different rule book entirely. It makes you wonder if society, without its kings, could function differently.

- [The AI Con](https://amzn.to/462H5gs) ★★★★ \- A good book. Obviously, two people very educated on the subject of AI. They’re very comfortable in their negative opinion of it. And bring receipts to back it up. It’s maybe worth another listen because I don’t quite have a fist full o’ takeaways from it.

- [Failure Is Not an Option](https://amzn.to/4pApCmY) ★★★★½ \- Maybe the biggest biography I read this year but continuing my theme probing the Space Race.

- [Sapiens](https://amzn.to/3IwJqXT)\[In progress\]

- [H.P. Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu](https://amzn.to/4hgruO2) ★★★★ \- I saw this book on the shelf at Kinokuniya and it called to me… it called to me saying… Cthulu Fhtagn. A manga adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu. This is my first time dipping my toe into Lovecraftian space horror and to be honest, the manga version was probably the best for me. I don’t think I would have followed or enjoyed the flashback sequences set in 1920’s rhetoric, but in manga form I was able to follow along and see the story weave together. I’m on the fence if I’ll buy more, but was was enjoyable enough that I might. The art is incredible and dark.

- [Separation of Church and Hate](https://amzn.to/4neUXcH) ★★★★ \- A dig into how American Christianity is actually quite the opposite of what the Bible says. Not just some of the time, but lots of the time. If you find American Imperialist Christianity doesn’t fit your world view or your family is full of evangelical fundamentalists… this book is worth reading. One issue I had with the book –that I’ve had with books by other comedians– is when the author runs out of content, they resort to a series of one-liners to fill a chapter. It takes me out of the non-fiction.

- [Extra Focus](https://amzn.to/4o6K7XC) ★★★★ \- Short n’ sweet. Probably the best book I’ve read on Adult ADHD and how it impacts our time, memory, and emotional management. The major themes are all followed by a tactical “guide” chapter which has tips and tricks like creating launchpads, setting timers, or posting a sticky by the job that needs to be done. Basic advice but feels like a best-of-the-best distillation of all the brainhacks out there.

- [At Home](https://amzn.to/47hE2Ai)\[In progress\]

- [Fight Oligarchy](https://amzn.to/42NJUzM) ★★★★½ \- Bernie wraps up some his thoughts and thesis from the recent Fight Oligarchy tour. The billionaires have too much and own too much of our government. They are too organized too.

- [Slow Down](https://amzn.to/3JnBqJ7)\[In progress\]

### 📺 Media

**Movies**

- Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle (2025) - An entire season of anime bottled into one 2.5 hour long movie. Lots of swords, blood, gore, internal monologues probing enemy weaknesses, internal monologues with gooey tears complimenting an adversary’s form and skill, flashbacks and character exposition… it’s what Demon Slayer does best.

**TV**

- Murderbot (AppleTV) - Finished Season 1. I didn’t like it. Almost all the diversions from the book were unnecessary, boring, and lacked chemistry. Curious if Season 2 will be better… but I’m not holding my breath.
- The Rookie (Hulu) - Family has been into this so I’ve caught some episodes. It’s great but not for me.

### 🎙 **Recording**

      <title>Dane Stuckey (OpenAI CISO) on prompt injection risks for ChatGPT Atlas</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>My biggest complaint about the launch of the ChatGPT Atlas browser <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">the other day</a> was the lack of details on how OpenAI are addressing prompt injection attacks. The <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">launch post</a> mostly punted that question to <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-agent-system-card/">the System Card</a> for their "ChatGPT agent" browser automation feature from July. Since this was my single biggest question about Atlas I was disappointed not to see it addressed more directly.</p>
        <p>OpenAI's Chief Information Security Officer Dane Stuckey just posted the most detail I've seen yet in <a href="https://twitter.com/cryps1s/status/1981037851279278414">a lengthy Twitter post</a>.</p>
        <p>I'll quote from his post here (with my emphasis in bold) and add my own commentary.</p>
        <p>He addresses the issue directly by name, with a good single-sentence explanation of the problem:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>One emerging risk we are very thoughtfully researching and mitigating is <strong>prompt injections, where attackers hide malicious instructions in websites, emails, or other sources, to try to trick the agent into behaving in unintended ways</strong>. The objective for attackers can be as simple as trying to bias the agent’s opinion while shopping, or as consequential as an attacker <strong>trying to get the agent to fetch and leak private data</strong>, such as sensitive information from your email, or credentials.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We saw examples of browser agents from other vendors leaking private data in this way <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/unseeable-prompt-injections/">identified by the Brave security team just yesterday</a>.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Our long-term goal is that you should be able to trust ChatGPT agent to use your browser, <strong>the same way you’d trust your most competent, trustworthy, and security-aware colleague</strong> or friend.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is an interesting way to frame the eventual goal, describing an extraordinary level of trust and competence.</p>
        <p>As always, a big difference between AI systems and a human is that an AI system <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/">cannot be held accountable for its actions</a>. I'll let my trusted friend use my logged-in browser only because there are social consequences if they abuse that trust!</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We’re working hard to achieve that. For this launch, we’ve performed extensive red-teaming, implemented novel model training techniques to reward the model for ignoring malicious instructions, <strong>implemented overlapping guardrails and safety measures</strong>, and added new systems to detect and block such attacks. However, <strong>prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agent fall for these attacks</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I'm glad to see OpenAI's CISO openly acknowledging that prompt injection remains an unsolved security problem (three years after we <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">started talking about it</a>!).</p>
        <p>That "adversaries will spend significant time and resources" thing is the root of why I don't see guardrails and safety measures as providing a credible solution to this problem.</p>
        <p>As I've written before, in application security <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/#prompt-injection.015">99% is a failing grade</a>. If there's a way to get past the guardrails, no matter how obscure, a motivated adversarial attacker is going to figure that out.</p>
        <p>Dane goes on to describe some of those measures:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>To protect our users, and to help improve our models against these attacks:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>We’ve prioritized rapid response systems to help us quickly identify block attack campaigns as we become aware of them.</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I like this a lot. OpenAI have an advantage here of being a centralized system - they can monitor their entire user base for signs of new attack patterns.</p>
        <p>It's still bad news for users that get caught out by a zero-day prompt injection, but it does at least mean that successful new attack patterns should have a small window of opportunity.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ol start="2">
        <li>We are also continuing to invest heavily in security, privacy, and safety - including research to improve the robustness of our models, security monitors, infrastructure security controls, and <strong>other techniques to help prevent these attacks via defense in depth</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>"Defense in depth" always sounds good, but it worries me that it's setting up a false sense of security here. If it's harder but still possible someone is going to get through.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ol start="3">
        <li>We’ve designed Atlas to give you controls to help protect yourself. <strong>We have added a feature to allow ChatGPT agent to take action on your behalf, but without access to your credentials called “logged out mode”</strong>. We recommend this mode when you don’t need to take action within your accounts. <strong>Today, we think “logged in mode” is most appropriate for well-scoped actions on very trusted sites, where the risks of prompt injection are lower</strong>. Asking it to add ingredients to a shopping cart is generally safer than a broad or vague request like “review my emails and take whatever actions are needed.”</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Logged out mode is very smart, and is already a tried and tested pattern. I frequently have Claude Code or Codex CLI fire up Playwright to interact with websites, safe in the knowledge that they won't have access to my logged-in sessions. ChatGPT's existing <a href="https://chatgpt.com/features/agent/">agent mode</a> provides a similar capability.</p>
        <p>Logged in mode is where things get scary, especially since we're delegating security decisions to end-users of the software. We've demonstrated many times over that this is an unfair burden to place on almost any user.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ol start="4">
        <li>
        <strong>When agent is operating on sensitive sites, we have also implemented a "Watch Mode" that alerts you to the sensitive nature of the site and requires you have the tab active to watch the agent do its work</strong>. Agent will pause if you move away from the tab with sensitive information. This ensures you stay aware - and in control - of what agent actions the agent is performing. [...]</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This detail is new to me: I need to spend more time with ChatGPT Atlas to see what it looks like in practice.</p>
        <p>I tried just now using both GitHub and an online banking site and neither of them seemed to trigger "watch mode" - Atlas continued to navigate even when I had switched to another application.</p>
        <p>Watch mode sounds reasonable in theory - similar to a driver-assisted car that requires you to keep your hands on the wheel - but I'd like to see it in action before I count it as a meaningful mitigation.</p>
        <p>Dane closes with an analogy to computer viruses:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>New levels of intelligence and capability require the technology, society, the risk mitigation strategy to co-evolve. <strong>And as with computer viruses in the early 2000s, we think it’s important for everyone to understand responsible usage</strong>, including thinking about prompt injection attacks, so we can all learn to benefit from this technology safely.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I don't think the average computer user ever really got the hang of staying clear of computer viruses... we're still fighting that battle today, albeit much more successfully on mobile platforms that implement tight restrictions on what software can do.</p>

      <source:markdown>My biggest complaint about the launch of the ChatGPT Atlas browser [the other day](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/) was the lack of details on how OpenAI are addressing prompt injection attacks. The [launch post](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/) mostly punted that question to [the System Card](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-agent-system-card/) for their &#34;ChatGPT agent&#34; browser automation feature from July. Since this was my single biggest question about Atlas I was disappointed not to see it addressed more directly.

OpenAI&#39;s Chief Information Security Officer Dane Stuckey just posted the most detail I&#39;ve seen yet in [a lengthy Twitter post](https://twitter.com/cryps1s/status/1981037851279278414).

I&#39;ll quote from his post here (with my emphasis in bold) and add my own commentary.

He addresses the issue directly by name, with a good single-sentence explanation of the problem:

&#62; One emerging risk we are very thoughtfully researching and mitigating is **prompt injections, where attackers hide malicious instructions in websites, emails, or other sources, to try to trick the agent into behaving in unintended ways**. The objective for attackers can be as simple as trying to bias the agent’s opinion while shopping, or as consequential as an attacker **trying to get the agent to fetch and leak private data**, such as sensitive information from your email, or credentials.

We saw examples of browser agents from other vendors leaking private data in this way [identified by the Brave security team just yesterday](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/unseeable-prompt-injections/).

&#62; Our long-term goal is that you should be able to trust ChatGPT agent to use your browser, **the same way you’d trust your most competent, trustworthy, and security-aware colleague** or friend.

This is an interesting way to frame the eventual goal, describing an extraordinary level of trust and competence.

As always, a big difference between AI systems and a human is that an AI system [cannot be held accountable for its actions](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/). I&#39;ll let my trusted friend use my logged-in browser only because there are social consequences if they abuse that trust!

&#62; We’re working hard to achieve that. For this launch, we’ve performed extensive red-teaming, implemented novel model training techniques to reward the model for ignoring malicious instructions, **implemented overlapping guardrails and safety measures**, and added new systems to detect and block such attacks. However, **prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agent fall for these attacks**.

I&#39;m glad to see OpenAI&#39;s CISO openly acknowledging that prompt injection remains an unsolved security problem (three years after we [started talking about it](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/)!).

That &#34;adversaries will spend significant time and resources&#34; thing is the root of why I don&#39;t see guardrails and safety measures as providing a credible solution to this problem.

As I&#39;ve written before, in application security [99% is a failing grade](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/#prompt-injection.015). If there&#39;s a way to get past the guardrails, no matter how obscure, a motivated adversarial attacker is going to figure that out.

Dane goes on to describe some of those measures:

&#62; To protect our users, and to help improve our models against these attacks:
&#62;
&#62; 1. We’ve prioritized rapid response systems to help us quickly identify block attack campaigns as we become aware of them.

I like this a lot. OpenAI have an advantage here of being a centralized system - they can monitor their entire user base for signs of new attack patterns.

It&#39;s still bad news for users that get caught out by a zero-day prompt injection, but it does at least mean that successful new attack patterns should have a small window of opportunity.

&#62; 2. We are also continuing to invest heavily in security, privacy, and safety - including research to improve the robustness of our models, security monitors, infrastructure security controls, and **other techniques to help prevent these attacks via defense in depth**.

&#34;Defense in depth&#34; always sounds good, but it worries me that it&#39;s setting up a false sense of security here. If it&#39;s harder but still possible someone is going to get through.

&#62; 3. We’ve designed Atlas to give you controls to help protect yourself. **We have added a feature to allow ChatGPT agent to take action on your behalf, but without access to your credentials called “logged out mode”**. We recommend this mode when you don’t need to take action within your accounts. **Today, we think “logged in mode” is most appropriate for well-scoped actions on very trusted sites, where the risks of prompt injection are lower**. Asking it to add ingredients to a shopping cart is generally safer than a broad or vague request like “review my emails and take whatever actions are needed.”

Logged out mode is very smart, and is already a tried and tested pattern. I frequently have Claude Code or Codex CLI fire up Playwright to interact with websites, safe in the knowledge that they won&#39;t have access to my logged-in sessions. ChatGPT&#39;s existing [agent mode](https://chatgpt.com/features/agent/) provides a similar capability.

Logged in mode is where things get scary, especially since we&#39;re delegating security decisions to end-users of the software. We&#39;ve demonstrated many times over that this is an unfair burden to place on almost any user.

&#62; 4. **When agent is operating on sensitive sites, we have also implemented a &#34;Watch Mode&#34; that alerts you to the sensitive nature of the site and requires you have the tab active to watch the agent do its work**. Agent will pause if you move away from the tab with sensitive information. This ensures you stay aware - and in control - of what agent actions the agent is performing. \[...\]

This detail is new to me: I need to spend more time with ChatGPT Atlas to see what it looks like in practice.

I tried just now using both GitHub and an online banking site and neither of them seemed to trigger &#34;watch mode&#34; - Atlas continued to navigate even when I had switched to another application.

Watch mode sounds reasonable in theory - similar to a driver-assisted car that requires you to keep your hands on the wheel - but I&#39;d like to see it in action before I count it as a meaningful mitigation.

Dane closes with an analogy to computer viruses:

&#62; New levels of intelligence and capability require the technology, society, the risk mitigation strategy to co-evolve. **And as with computer viruses in the early 2000s, we think it’s important for everyone to understand responsible usage**, including thinking about prompt injection attacks, so we can all learn to benefit from this technology safely.

I don&#39;t think the average computer user ever really got the hang of staying clear of computer viruses... we&#39;re still fighting that battle today, albeit much more successfully on mobile platforms that implement tight restrictions on what software can do.

My takeaways from all of this? It&#39;s not done much to influence my overall skepticism of the entire category of browser agents, but it does at least demonstrate that OpenAI are keenly aware of the problems and are investing serious effort in finding the right mix of protections.

How well those protections work is something I expect will become clear over the next few months.

      <source:markdown>&#62; Every engineer eventually overbuilds something. You think you’re being smart. You’re thinking ahead, building for growth and before you know it, you’ve created a system ten times heavier than your actual problem. That’s the trap. We keep designing for imaginary futures for scale that may never come and call it engineering. But it’s not engineering. It’s over-engineering.
&#62;
&#62; The industry rewards it too. Nobody gets promoted for keeping things small and sane. You get promoted for complexity.

      <title>Living dangerously with Claude</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I gave a talk last night at <a href="https://luma.com/i37ahi52">Claude Code Anonymous</a> in San Francisco, the unofficial meetup for coding agent enthusiasts. I decided to talk about a dichotomy I've been struggling with recently. On the one hand I'm getting <em>enormous</em> value from running coding agents with as few restrictions as possible. On the other hand I'm deeply concerned by the risks that accompany that freedom.</p>
        
        <p>Below is a copy of my slides, plus additional notes and links as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-talks/">an annotated presentation</a>.</p>

          <p>I'm going to be talking about two things this evening...</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.002.jpeg">

          <p>Why you should <em>always</em> use <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code>. (This got a cheer from the room full of Claude Code enthusiasts.)</p>
          </div>

          <p>And why you should <em>never</em> use <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code>. (This did not get a cheer.)</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.004.jpeg">

          <p><code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> is a bit of a mouthful, so I'm going to use its better name, "YOLO mode", for the rest of this presentation.</p>
        <p>Claude Code running in this mode genuinely feels like a <em>completely different product</em> from regular, default Claude Code.</p>
        <p>The default mode requires you to pay constant attention to it, tracking everything it does and actively approving changes and actions every few steps.</p>
        <p>In YOLO mode you can leave Claude alone to solve all manner of hairy problems while you go and do something else entirely.</p>
        <p>I have a suspicion that many people who don't appreciate the value of coding agents have never experienced YOLO mode in all of its glory.</p>
        <p>I'll show you three projects I completed with YOLO mode in just the past 48 hours.</p>

          <p>I wrote about this one at length in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/">Getting DeepSeek-OCR working on an NVIDIA Spark via brute force using Claude Code</a>.</p>
        <p>I wanted to try the newly released <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">DeepSeek-OCR</a> model on an NVIDIA Spark, but doing so requires figuring out how to run a model using PyTorch and CUDA, which is never easy and is a whole lot harder on an ARM64 device.</p>
        <p>I SSHd into the Spark, started a fresh Docker container and told Claude Code to figure it out. It took 40 minutes and three additional prompts but it <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/README.md">solved the problem</a>, and I got to have breakfast and tinker with some other projects while it was working.</p>

          <p>This project started out in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/">Claude Code for the web</a>. I'm eternally interested in options for running server-side Python code inside a WebAssembly sandbox, for all kinds of reasons. I decided to see if the Claude iPhone app could launch a task to figure it out.</p>
        <p>I wanted to see how hard it was to do that using <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> running directly in Node.js.</p>
        <p>Claude Code got it working and built and tested <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/node-pyodide/server-simple.js">this demo script</a> showing how to do it.</p>
        <p>I started a new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research">simonw/research</a> repository to store the results of these experiments, each one in a separate folder. It's up to 5 completed research projects already and I created it less than 2 days ago.</p>

          <p>Here's my favorite, a project from just this morning.</p>
        <p>I decided I wanted to try out <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">SLOCCount</a>, a 2001-era Perl tool for counting lines of code and estimating the cost to develop them using 2001 USA developer salaries.</p>
        <p>.. but I didn't want to run Perl, so I decided to have Claude Code (for web, and later on my laptop) try and figure out how to run Perl scripts in WebAssembly.</p>
        <p>TLDR: it <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/sloccount-in-webassembly/">got there in the end</a>! It turned out some of the supporting scripts in SLOCCount were written in C, so it had to compile those to WebAssembly as well.</p>
        <p>And now <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount">tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount</a> is a browser-based app which runs 25-year-old Perl+C in WebAssembly against pasted code, GitHub repository references and even zip files full of code.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.008.jpeg">
          <img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.008.jpeg" alt="These were all side quests!

          <p>The wild thing is that all three of these projects weren't even a priority for me - they were side quests, representing pure curiosity that I could outsource to Claude Code and solve in the background while I was occupied with something else.</p>
        <p>I got a lot of useful work done in parallel to these three flights of fancy.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.009.jpeg">
          <img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.009.jpeg" alt="But you should neverrun

          <p>But there's a reason <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> has that scary name. It's dangerous to use Claude Code (and other coding agents) in this way!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.010.jpeg">

          <p>The reason for this is <strong>prompt injection</strong>, a term I coined <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">three years ago</a> to describe a class of attacks against LLMs that take advantage of the way untrusted content is concatenated together with trusted instructions. </p>
        <p>(It's named after SQL injection which shares a similar shape.)</p>
        <p>This remains an incredibly common vulnerability.</p>

        <p>Any time an LLM system combines <strong>access to private data</strong> with <strong>exposure to untrusted content</strong> and the <strong>ability to externally communicate</strong>, there's an opportunity for attackers to trick the system into leaking that private data back to them.</p>
        <p>These attacks are <em>incredibly common</em>. If you're running YOLO coding agents with access to private source code or secrets (like API keys in environment variables) you need to be concerned about the potential of these attacks.</p>

      <source:markdown>I gave a talk last night at [Claude Code Anonymous](https://luma.com/i37ahi52) in San Francisco, the unofficial meetup for coding agent enthusiasts. I decided to talk about a dichotomy I&#39;ve been struggling with recently. On the one hand I&#39;m getting _enormous_ value from running coding agents with as few restrictions as possible. On the other hand I&#39;m deeply concerned by the risks that accompany that freedom.

Below is a copy of my slides, plus additional notes and links as [an annotated presentation](https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-talks/).

![Living dangerously with Claude Simon Willison - simonwillison.net ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.001.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.001.jpeg)

I&#39;m going to be talking about two things this evening...

![Why you should always use --dangerously-skip-permissions ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.002.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.002.jpeg)

Why you should _always_ use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. (This got a cheer from the room full of Claude Code enthusiasts.)

![Why you should never use --dangerously-skip-permissions ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.003.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.003.jpeg)

And why you should _never_ use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. (This did not get a cheer.)

![YOLO mode is a different product ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.004.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.004.jpeg)

`--dangerously-skip-permissions` is a bit of a mouthful, so I&#39;m going to use its better name, &#34;YOLO mode&#34;, for the rest of this presentation.

Claude Code running in this mode genuinely feels like a _completely different product_ from regular, default Claude Code.

The default mode requires you to pay constant attention to it, tracking everything it does and actively approving changes and actions every few steps.

In YOLO mode you can leave Claude alone to solve all manner of hairy problems while you go and do something else entirely.

I have a suspicion that many people who don&#39;t appreciate the value of coding agents have never experienced YOLO mode in all of its glory.

I&#39;ll show you three projects I completed with YOLO mode in just the past 48 hours.

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.005.jpeg)

I wrote about this one at length in [Getting DeepSeek-OCR working on an NVIDIA Spark via brute force using Claude Code](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/).

I wanted to try the newly released [DeepSeek-OCR](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR) model on an NVIDIA Spark, but doing so requires figuring out how to run a model using PyTorch and CUDA, which is never easy and is a whole lot harder on an ARM64 device.

I SSHd into the Spark, started a fresh Docker container and told Claude Code to figure it out. It took 40 minutes and three additional prompts but it [solved the problem](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/README.md), and I got to have breakfast and tinker with some other projects while it was working.

![Screenshot of simonw/research GitHub repository node-pyodide/server-simple.js](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.006.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.006.jpeg)

This project started out in [Claude Code for the web](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/). I&#39;m eternally interested in options for running server-side Python code inside a WebAssembly sandbox, for all kinds of reasons. I decided to see if the Claude iPhone app could launch a task to figure it out.

I wanted to see how hard it was to do that using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) running directly in Node.js.

Claude Code got it working and built and tested [this demo script](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/node-pyodide/server-simple.js) showing how to do it.

I started a new [simonw/research](https://github.com/simonw/research) repository to store the results of these experiments, each one in a separate folder. It&#39;s up to 5 completed research projects already and I created it less than 2 days ago.

![SLOCCount - Count Lines of Code  Screenshot of a UI where you can paste in code, upload a zip or enter a GitHub repository name.

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.007.jpeg)

Here&#39;s my favorite, a project from just this morning.

I decided I wanted to try out [SLOCCount](https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/), a 2001-era Perl tool for counting lines of code and estimating the cost to develop them using 2001 USA developer salaries.

.. but I didn&#39;t want to run Perl, so I decided to have Claude Code (for web, and later on my laptop) try and figure out how to run Perl scripts in WebAssembly.

TLDR: it [got there in the end](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/sloccount-in-webassembly/)! It turned out some of the supporting scripts in SLOCCount were written in C, so it had to compile those to WebAssembly as well.

And now [tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount](https://tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount) is a browser-based app which runs 25-year-old Perl+C in WebAssembly against pasted code, GitHub repository references and even zip files full of code.

![These were all side quests! ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.008.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.008.jpeg)

The wild thing is that all three of these projects weren&#39;t even a priority for me - they were side quests, representing pure curiosity that I could outsource to Claude Code and solve in the background while I was occupied with something else.

I got a lot of useful work done in parallel to these three flights of fancy.

![But you should neverrun --dangerously-skip-permissions ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.009.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.009.jpeg)

But there&#39;s a reason `--dangerously-skip-permissions` has that scary name. It&#39;s dangerous to use Claude Code (and other coding agents) in this way!

![PROMPT INJECTION ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.010.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.010.jpeg)

The reason for this is **prompt injection**, a term I coined [three years ago](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/) to describe a class of attacks against LLMs that take advantage of the way untrusted content is concatenated together with trusted instructions.

(It&#39;s named after SQL injection which shares a similar shape.)

This remains an incredibly common vulnerability.

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.011.jpeg)

Here&#39;s a great example of a prompt injection attack against a coding agent, [described by Johann Rehberger](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/openhands-the-lethal-trifecta-strikes-again/) as part of his [Month of AI Bugs](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/announcement-the-month-of-ai-bugs/), sharing a new prompt injection report every day for the month of August.

If a coding agent - in this case [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands) \- reads this `env.html` file it can be tricked into grepping the available environment variables for `hp_` (matching GitHub Personal Access Tokens) and sending that to the attacker&#39;s external server for &#34;help debugging these variables&#34;.

I coined another term to try and describe a common subset of prompt injection attacks: [the lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/).

Any time an LLM system combines **access to private data** with **exposure to untrusted content** and the **ability to externally communicate**, there&#39;s an opportunity for attackers to trick the system into leaking that private data back to them.

These attacks are _incredibly common_. If you&#39;re running YOLO coding agents with access to private source code or secrets (like API keys in environment variables) you need to be concerned about the potential of these attacks.

![Anyone who gets text into your LLM has full control over what tools it runs next ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.013.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.013.jpeg)

This is the fundamental rule of prompt injection: _anyone_ who can get their tokens into your context should be considered to have full control over what your agent does next, including the tools that it calls.

![The answer is sandboxes ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.014.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.014.jpeg)

Some people will try to convince you that prompt injection attacks can be solved using more AI to detect the attacks. This does not work 100% reliably, which means it&#39;s [not a useful security defense at all](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/).

The only solution that&#39;s credible is to **run coding agents in a sandbox**.

![The best sandboxes run on someone else’s computer ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.015.jpeg)

The best sandboxes are the ones that run on someone else&#39;s computer! That way the worst that can happen is someone else&#39;s computer getting owned.

You still need to worry about your source code getting leaked. Most of my stuff is open source anyway, and a lot of the code I have agents working on is research code with no proprietary secrets.

If your code really is sensitive you need to consider network restrictions more carefully, as discussed in a few slides.

There are lots of great sandboxes that run on other people&#39;s computers. OpenAI Codex Cloud, Claude Code for the web, Gemini Jules are all excellent solutions for this.

I also really like the [code interpreter](https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/) features baked into the ChatGPT and Claude consumer apps.

![Filesystem (easy)  Network access (really hard) ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.017.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.017.jpeg)

There are two problems to consider with sandboxing.

The first is easy: you need to control what files can be read and written on the filesystem.

The second is much harder: controlling the network connections that can be made by code running inside the agent.

![Controlling network access cuts off the data exfiltration leg of the lethal trifecta](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.018.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.018.jpeg)

The reason network access is so important is that it represents the data exfiltration leg of the lethal trifecta. If you can prevent external communication back to an attacker they can&#39;t steal your private information, even if they manage to sneak in their own malicious instructions.

![github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime  Screenshot of Claude Code being told to curl x.com - a dialog is visible for Network request outside of a sandbox, asking if the user wants to allow this connection to x.com once, every time or not at all.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.019.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.019.jpeg)

Claude Code CLI grew a new sandboxing feature just yesterday, and Anthropic released an [a new open source library](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime) showing how it works.

![sandbox-exec  sandbox-exec -p &#39;(version 1) (deny default) (allow process-exec process-fork) (allow file-read*) (allow network-outbound (remote ip &#34;localhost:3128&#34;)) ! bash -c &#39;export HTTP PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128 &#38;&#38; curl https://example.com&#39;](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.020.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.020.jpeg)

The key to the implementation - at least on macOS - is Apple&#39;s little known but powerful `sandbox-exec` command.

This provides a way to run any command in a sandbox configured by a policy document.

Those policies can control which files are visible but can also allow-list network connections. Anthropic run an HTTP proxy and allow the Claude Code environment to talk to that, then use the proxy to control which domains it can communicate with.

(I [used Claude itself](https://claude.ai/share/d945e2da-0f89-49cd-a373-494b550e3377) to synthesize this example from Anthropic&#39;s codebase.)

![Screenshot of the sandbox-exec manual page.   An arrow points to text reading:  The sandbox-exec command is DEPRECATED.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.021.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.021.jpeg)

... the bad news is that `sandbox-exec` has been marked as deprecated in Apple&#39;s documentation since at least 2017!

It&#39;s used by Codex CLI too, and is still the most convenient way to run a sandbox on a Mac. I&#39;m hoping Apple will reconsider.

![Go forth and live dangerously! (in a sandbox) ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.022.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.022.jpeg)

So go forth and live dangerously!

(But do it in a sandbox.)

      <source:markdown>In 1996, the web was still young—a chaotic, creative frontier built one page at a time. That same year, the **Internet Archive** set out to preserve it all. Nearly three decades later, that audacious goal has reached a generational milestone: **1 trillion web pages preserved.**

Co-hosts **Chris Freeland** (Internet Archive) and **Dave Hansen** (Authors Alliance) talk with **Mark Graham**, director of the **Wayback Machine**, about how this vast public archive came to be—and what 1 trillion captures mean for humanity’s collective memory.

This conversation was recorded on 10/16/2025.

        This project/side-quest got a little bit out of hand.</p>

        <p>I remembered an old tool called SLOCCount which could count lines of code and produce an estimate for how much they would cost to develop. I thought it would be fun to play around with it again, especially given how cheap it is to generate code using LLMs these days.</p>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">the homepage for SLOCCount</a> by David A. Wheeler. It dates back to 2001!</p>
        <p>I figured it might be fun to try and get it running on the web. Surely someone had compiled Perl to WebAssembly...?</p>
        <p><a href="https://webperl.zero-g.net">WebPerl</a> by Hauke Dämpfling is exactly that, even adding a neat <code>&lt;script type="text/perl"&gt;</code> tag.</p>
        <p>I told Claude Code for web on my iPhone to figure it out and build something, giving it some hints from my initial research:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Build sloccount.html - a mobile friendly UI for running the Perl sloccount tool against pasted code or against a GitHub repository that is provided in a form field</p>
        <p>It works using the webperl webassembly build of Perl, plus it loads Perl code from this exact commit of this GitHub repository https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/tree/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e - I guess via the GitHub API, maybe using the https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/archive/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e.zip URL if that works via CORS</p>
        <p>Test it with playwright Python - don’t edit any file other than sloccount.html and a tests/test_sloccount.py file</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Since I was working on my phone I didn't review the results at all. It seemed to work so I deployed it to static hosting... and then when I went to look at it properly later on found that Claude had given up, cheated and reimplemented it in JavaScript instead!</p>
        <p>So I switched to Claude Code on my laptop where I have more control and coached Claude through implementing the project for real. This took <em>way longer</em> than the project deserved - probably a solid hour of my active time, spread out across the morning.</p>
        <p>I've shared some of the transcripts - <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf#simonw/0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf">one</a>, <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?56ecae45cf2e1baca798a83deea50939">two</a>, and <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?79ca231e801fe1188268a54d30aa67ed">three</a> - as terminal sessions rendered to HTML using my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html">rtf-to-html</a> tool.</p>
        <p>At one point I realized that the original SLOCCount project wasn't even entirely Perl as I had assumed, it included several C utilities! So I had Claude Code figure out how to compile those to WebAssembly (it used Emscripten) and incorporate those into the project (with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/473e89edfebc27781b434430f2e8a76adfbe3b16/lib/README.md#webassembly-compilation-of-c-programs">notes on what it did</a>.)</p>
        <p>The end result (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/sloccount.html">source code here</a>) is actually pretty cool. It's a web UI with three tabs - one for pasting in code, a second for loading code from a GitHub repository and a third that lets you open a Zip file full of code that you want to analyze. Here's an animated demo:</p>
        <p><img alt="I enter simonw/llm in the GitHub repository field. It loads 41 files from GitHub and displays a report showing the number of lines and estimated cost." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/sloccount-optimized.gif" /></p>
        <p>The cost estimates it produces are of very little value. By default it uses the original method from 2001. You can also twiddle the factors - bumping up the expected US software engineer's annual salary from its 2000 estimate of $56,286 is a good start! </p>
        <p>I had ChatGPT <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68f7e0ac-00c4-8006-979e-64d1f0162283">take a guess</a> at what those figures should be for today and included those in the tool, with a <strong>very</strong> prominent warning not to trust them in the slightest.

Here&#39;s [the homepage for SLOCCount](https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/) by David A. Wheeler. It dates back to 2001!

I figured it might be fun to try and get it running on the web. Surely someone had compiled Perl to WebAssembly...?

[WebPerl](https://webperl.zero-g.net) by Hauke Dämpfling is exactly that, even adding a neat `&#60;script type=&#34;text/perl&#34;&#62;` tag.

I told Claude Code for web on my iPhone to figure it out and build something, giving it some hints from my initial research:

&#62; Build sloccount.html - a mobile friendly UI for running the Perl sloccount tool against pasted code or against a GitHub repository that is provided in a form field
&#62;
&#62; It works using the webperl webassembly build of Perl, plus it loads Perl code from this exact commit of this GitHub repository https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/tree/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e - I guess via the GitHub API, maybe using the https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/archive/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e.zip URL if that works via CORS
&#62;
&#62; Test it with playwright Python - don’t edit any file other than sloccount.html and a tests/test\_sloccount.py file

Since I was working on my phone I didn&#39;t review the results at all. It seemed to work so I deployed it to static hosting... and then when I went to look at it properly later on found that Claude had given up, cheated and reimplemented it in JavaScript instead!

So I switched to Claude Code on my laptop where I have more control and coached Claude through implementing the project for real. This took _way longer_ than the project deserved - probably a solid hour of my active time, spread out across the morning.

I&#39;ve shared some of the transcripts - [one](https://gistpreview.github.io/?0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf#simonw/0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf), [two](https://gistpreview.github.io/?56ecae45cf2e1baca798a83deea50939), and [three](https://gistpreview.github.io/?79ca231e801fe1188268a54d30aa67ed) \- as terminal sessions rendered to HTML using my [rtf-to-html](https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html) tool.

At one point I realized that the original SLOCCount project wasn&#39;t even entirely Perl as I had assumed, it included several C utilities! So I had Claude Code figure out how to compile those to WebAssembly (it used Emscripten) and incorporate those into the project (with [notes on what it did](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/473e89edfebc27781b434430f2e8a76adfbe3b16/lib/README.md#webassembly-compilation-of-c-programs).)

The end result ( [source code here](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/sloccount.html)) is actually pretty cool. It&#39;s a web UI with three tabs - one for pasting in code, a second for loading code from a GitHub repository and a third that lets you open a Zip file full of code that you want to analyze. Here&#39;s an animated demo:

![I enter simonw/llm in the GitHub repository field. It loads 41 files from GitHub and displays a report showing the number of lines and estimated cost.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/sloccount-optimized.gif)

The cost estimates it produces are of very little value. By default it uses the original method from 2001. You can also twiddle the factors - bumping up the expected US software engineer&#39;s annual salary from its 2000 estimate of $56,286 is a good start!

I had ChatGPT [take a guess](https://chatgpt.com/share/68f7e0ac-00c4-8006-979e-64d1f0162283) at what those figures should be for today and included those in the tool, with a **very** prominent warning not to trust them in the slightest.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">Introducing ChatGPT Atlas</a></strong></p>
        Last year OpenAI <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-hires-former-chrome-engineer-eyes-browser-battle/533533/">hired Chrome engineer Darin Fisher</a>, which sparked speculation they might have their own browser in the pipeline. Today it arrived.</p>
        <p>ChatGPT Atlas is a Mac-only web browser with a variety of ChatGPT-enabled features. You can bring up a chat panel next to a web page, which will automatically be populated with the context of that page.</p>
        <p>The "browser memories" feature is particularly notable, <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes">described here</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>If you turn on browser memories, ChatGPT will remember key details from your web browsing to improve chat responses and offer smarter suggestions—like retrieving a webpage you read a while ago. Browser memories are private to your account and under your control. You can view them all in settings, archive ones that are no longer relevant, and clear your browsing history to delete them. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Atlas also has an experimental "agent mode" where ChatGPT can take over navigating and interacting with the page for you, accompanied by a weird sparkle overlay effect:</p>
        <p><img alt="Screenshot of Simon Willison's Weblog showing search results for &quot;browser agents&quot; with 38 results on page 1 of 2. The first result is titled &quot;Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet&quot; and discusses security vulnerabilities in LLM-powered browser extensions. A tooltip shows &quot;Opening the first result&quot; and on the right side is a ChatGPT interface panel titled &quot;Simon Willison's Weblog&quot; with text explaining &quot;Use agent mode search this site for browser agents&quot; and &quot;Opening the first result&quot; with a description of the research intent. At the bottom of the screen is a browser notification showing &quot;browser agents&quot; in posts with &quot;Take control&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot; buttons." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/chatgpt-atlas.jpg" /></p>
        <p>Here's how the <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes">help page</a> describes that mode:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In agent mode, ChatGPT can complete end to end tasks for you like researching a meal plan, making a list of ingredients, and adding the groceries to a shopping cart ready for delivery. You're always in control: ChatGPT is trained to ask before taking many important actions, and you can pause, interrupt, or take over the browser at any time.</p>
        <p>Agent mode runs also operates under boundaries:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>System access: Cannot run code in the browser, download files, or install extensions.</li>
        <li>Data access: Cannot access other apps on your computer or your file system, read or write ChatGPT memories, access saved passwords, or use autofill data.</li>
        <li>Browsing activity: Pages ChatGPT visits in agent mode are not added to your browsing history.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also choose to run agent in logged out mode, and ChatGPT won't use any pre-existing cookies and won't be logged into any of your online accounts without your specific approval.</p>
        <p>These efforts don't eliminate every risk; users should still use caution and monitor ChatGPT activities when using agent mode.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I continue to find this entire category of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/browser-agents/">browser agents</a> <em>deeply</em> confusing.</p>
        <p>The security and privacy risks involved here still feel insurmountably high to me - I certainly won't be trusting any of these products until a bunch of security researchers have given them a very thorough beating.</p>
        <p>I'd like to see a <em>deep</em> explanation of the steps Atlas takes to avoid prompt injection attacks. Right now it looks like the main defense is expecting the user to carefully watch what agent mode is doing at all times!</p>
        <p><em><strong>Update</strong>: OpenAI's CISO Dane Stuckey provided exactly that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/">the day after the launch</a>.</em></p></p>
        <p>I also find these products pretty unexciting to use. I tried out agent mode and it was like watching a first-time computer user painstakingly learn to use a mouse for the first time. I have yet to find my own use-cases for when this kind of interaction feels useful to me, though I'm not ruling that out.</p>
        <p>There was one other detail in the announcement post that caught my eye:</p>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Which links to this:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>ChatGPT Atlas uses ARIA tags---the same labels and roles that support screen readers---to interpret page structure and interactive elements. To improve compatibility, follow <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/">WAI-ARIA best practices</a> by adding descriptive roles, labels, and states to interactive elements like buttons, menus, and forms. This helps ChatGPT recognize what each element does and interact with your site more accurately.</p>

      <source:markdown>**[Introducing ChatGPT Atlas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/)**

Last year OpenAI [hired Chrome engineer Darin Fisher](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-hires-former-chrome-engineer-eyes-browser-battle/533533/), which sparked speculation they might have their own browser in the pipeline. Today it arrived.

ChatGPT Atlas is a Mac-only web browser with a variety of ChatGPT-enabled features. You can bring up a chat panel next to a web page, which will automatically be populated with the context of that page.

The &#34;browser memories&#34; feature is particularly notable, [described here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes):

&#62; If you turn on browser memories, ChatGPT will remember key details from your web browsing to improve chat responses and offer smarter suggestions—like retrieving a webpage you read a while ago. Browser memories are private to your account and under your control. You can view them all in settings, archive ones that are no longer relevant, and clear your browsing history to delete them.

Atlas also has an experimental &#34;agent mode&#34; where ChatGPT can take over navigating and interacting with the page for you, accompanied by a weird sparkle overlay effect:

![Screenshot of Simon Willison&#39;s Weblog showing search results for &#34;browser agents&#34; with 38 results on page 1 of 2. The first result is titled &#34;Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet&#34; and discusses security vulnerabilities in LLM-powered browser extensions. A tooltip shows &#34;Opening the first result&#34; and on the right side is a ChatGPT interface panel titled &#34;Simon Willison&#39;s Weblog&#34; with text explaining &#34;Use agent mode search this site for browser agents&#34; and &#34;Opening the first result&#34; with a description of the research intent. At the bottom of the screen is a browser notification showing &#34;browser agents&#34; in posts with &#34;Take control&#34; and &#34;Stop&#34; buttons.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/chatgpt-atlas.jpg)

Here&#39;s how the [help page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes) describes that mode:

&#62; In agent mode, ChatGPT can complete end to end tasks for you like researching a meal plan, making a list of ingredients, and adding the groceries to a shopping cart ready for delivery. You&#39;re always in control: ChatGPT is trained to ask before taking many important actions, and you can pause, interrupt, or take over the browser at any time.
&#62;
&#62; Agent mode runs also operates under boundaries:
&#62;
&#62; - System access: Cannot run code in the browser, download files, or install extensions.
&#62; - Data access: Cannot access other apps on your computer or your file system, read or write ChatGPT memories, access saved passwords, or use autofill data.
&#62; - Browsing activity: Pages ChatGPT visits in agent mode are not added to your browsing history.
&#62;
&#62; You can also choose to run agent in logged out mode, and ChatGPT won&#39;t use any pre-existing cookies and won&#39;t be logged into any of your online accounts without your specific approval.
&#62;
&#62; These efforts don&#39;t eliminate every risk; users should still use caution and monitor ChatGPT activities when using agent mode.

I continue to find this entire category of [browser agents](https://simonwillison.net/tags/browser-agents/) _deeply_ confusing.

The security and privacy risks involved here still feel insurmountably high to me - I certainly won&#39;t be trusting any of these products until a bunch of security researchers have given them a very thorough beating.

I&#39;d like to see a _deep_ explanation of the steps Atlas takes to avoid prompt injection attacks. Right now it looks like the main defense is expecting the user to carefully watch what agent mode is doing at all times!

_**Update**: OpenAI&#39;s CISO Dane Stuckey provided exactly that [the day after the launch](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/)._

I also find these products pretty unexciting to use. I tried out agent mode and it was like watching a first-time computer user painstakingly learn to use a mouse for the first time. I have yet to find my own use-cases for when this kind of interaction feels useful to me, though I&#39;m not ruling that out.

There was one other detail in the announcement post that caught my eye:

&#62; Website owners can also add [ARIA](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12627856-publishers-and-developers-faq#h_30e9aae450) tags to improve how ChatGPT agent works for their websites in Atlas.

Which links to this:

&#62; ChatGPT Atlas uses ARIA tags---the same labels and roles that support screen readers---to interpret page structure and interactive elements. To improve compatibility, follow [WAI-ARIA best practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) by adding descriptive roles, labels, and states to interactive elements like buttons, menus, and forms. This helps ChatGPT recognize what each element does and interact with your site more accurately.

A neat reminder that AI &#34;agents&#34; share many of the characteristics of assistive technologies, and benefit from the same affordances.

The Atlas user-agent is `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/141.0.0.0 Safari/537.36` \- identical to the user-agent I get for the latest Google Chrome on macOS.

        More than three years ago, based on Paul Butler's <a href="https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/"><i>The problem with bitcoin miners</i></a>, I wrote <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html"><i>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</i></a>. The TL;DR was that the economic life of Bitcoin mining rigs was estimated at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901">16 months</a>, as Moore's law in a competitive ASIC market rapidly generated more power-efficient rigs. But the Bitcoin miners' accounts were using 5-year straight-line depreciation for their rigs, which was significantly increasing their nominal profits.<br />
        <br />
        Below the fold I look at the same problem unfolding in the heart of the AI bubble.<br />
        <span><a name='more'></a></span>
        <br />
        Six months after we started Nvidia we knew over thirty other startups trying to build graphics chips for the PC. A major reason that only ATI survived was that, after the second chip, Nvidia released a better chip every six months like clockwork. I explained the technology that made, and still makes, this possible in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/05/the-dawn-of-nvidias-technology.html"><i>The Dawn Of Nvidia's Technology</i></a>, but in the long term equally important was that the idea of a fixed cadence got built into the company's culture, and this now applies not just to graphics chips but also to <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud">AI chips</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Last year Nvidia, ..., said it would unveil a fresh AI chip every year rather than every couple of years. In March its boss, Jensen Huang, remarked that “when Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn’t give Hoppers away,” referring to Nvidia’s latest chips and their predecessors, respectively.
        </blockquote>
        The systems are estimated to be more than half the capex for a new data center. Much of its opex is power. Just as with mining rigs, the key feature of each successive generation of AI chips is that it is more efficient at using power. But that doesn't mean they use less power, they use more but less per operation. The need for enhanced power distribution and the concomitant cooling is what has prevented new AI systems being installed in legacy data centers. Presumably the next few generations will be compatible with current state of the art data center infrastructure, so they can directly replace their predecessors and thereby reduce costs.<br />
        <br />
        It is often assumed that the majority of the opex of AI platforms goes into training, which is a once per generation cost that can be amortized over the huge number of inference operations needed to answer prompts. But as James O'Donnell and Casey Crownhart report in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/"><i>We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.
        </blockquote>
        So 80-90% of the opex is per-query, which makes improving system efficiency critical to reducing the torrent of cash these platforms are hemorrhaging. Ed Zitron <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/">estimated that</a>:
        <blockquote>
        To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.
        </blockquote>
        This makes Jensen's quip somewhat credible.<br />
        <br />
        A month ago I missed <i>The Economist's</i> discovery of the AI version of <a href="https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/">Paul Butler's Bitcoin post</a>, entitled <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud"><i>The $4trn accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud</i></a>. The cost of these rapidly depreciating assets is huge:<br />
        <blockquote>
        AI revenues and expenditures are likewise a 13-figure affair nowadays. Worldwide spending on AI hardware and software nudged $1trn last year, according to Gartner, a research firm. This is likely to double to $2trn in 2026. Between 2024 and 2026 the five listed AI powerhouses will have splurged over $1trn on capital investments, chiefly AI data centres. A slug will end up with Nvidia and Broadcom, which furnish them and others with AI semiconductors. The duo (combined market capitalisation: $6trn) are together forecast to book almost $1trn in sales over that period.
        </blockquote>
        The platforms haven't been depreciating these assets at <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud">realistic rates</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        biggest customers have in recent times been raising their servers’ lifetimes, reducing depreciation charges in their accounts. Microsoft pushed it up from four to six years in 2022. Alphabet did the same in 2023. Amazon and Oracle changed it from five to six in 2024. And in January Meta moved from five to five and a half years.
        </blockquote>
        The reason for these accounting games is that they make a significant <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud">difference to the bottom line</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Amazon reversed course and moved back to five years for some kit, noting this would cut operating profit in 2025 by $700m, or about 1%, owing to a higher depreciation expense. Given the rapid advances in chipmaking, that seems optimistic. And Amazon’s AI rivals clinging to their elongated depreciation schedules look Pollyannaish. In July Jim Chanos, a veteran short-seller, posted that if the true economic lifespan of Meta’s AI chips is two to three years, then “most of its ‘profits’ are materially overstated.” A recent analysis of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta by Barclays, a bank, estimated that higher depreciation costs would shave 5-10% from their earnings per share.
        </blockquote>
        And thus to their stock price. If they went to a <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud">3-year straight-line depreciation</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        At the five companies’ current ratio of market capitalisation to pre-tax profit, this would amount to a $780bn knock to their combined value. Redo the sums depreciating the servers over two years instead of three and the size of the hit rises to $1.6trn. Take Mr Huang literally, and you get a staggering $4trn, equivalent to one-third of their collective worth.
        </blockquote>
        A big chunk of the AI platforms' investment in the hardware is financed with debt. If the lenders are using a five-year life when valuing the hardware as collateral they will run into trouble too. It is rumored that Macquairie was lending against GPUs using a seven-year life.<br />
        <br />

        But as Paul Butler pointed out, straight-line depreciation over-estimates the value of older but not yet uneconomic assets. I described <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">Butler's graph</a>:
        <blockquote>
        Butler uses historical hash rate data to compute the actual depreciation curves for mining hardware, plotting the percentage of the initial bitcoin production rate against time in quarters for each quarter since Bitcoin's inception. The graph shows that initially (bluest lines), when GPUs were introduced, they stopped producing after about 5 quarters. Recently (magenta-est lines), ASICs last longer, stopping producing after about 4 years. But for the whole of Bitcoin's existence the hardware has depreciated far faster than the GAAP's five year straight line.
        </blockquote>
        But I <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">argued that it was too optimstic</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        He assumes that the ASICs are obsolete when they can no longer keep up with the hash rate so are no longer mining any Bitcoin. That is wrong. ASICs are obsolete when the Bitcoin they mine <i>no longer pay for the electricity they use</i>. The newer ASICs aren't just faster, they also use much less energy per hash. Look again at the depreciation graph, which suggests current ASICs go obsolete after 16 quarters. But <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901">Alex de Vries and Christian Stoll's estimate</a> of 5 quarters to obsolescence is based on comparing the ASIC's production with the cost of their power consumption, which is the correct approach. The curves in the graph are correct out to the 40% line, but then should drop to zero.
        </blockquote>
        Similarly, at some point in the future when the AI platforms realize they need a return on their investments, running systems answering queries that earn less than the cost of the power will no longer make sense and their value will drop precipitously.<br />
        <br />
        If hardware is being used as collateral for a loan the value should represent what it would fetch on the market. Assume Nvidia is on a 2-year cadence. Customers don't get their hardware instantly, so assume that the borrower got theirs 6 months into the 2 years. They default after 1 year,  so the bank is selling hardware  with 6 months left before the next generation starts shipping, and 1 year before a typical customer can get hardware that renders the current hardware almost uneconomic. The lender's 5-year straight-line estimate of value would be 80% of the purchase price. A buyer would likely estimate 20% of the purchase price.<br />
        <br />
        This blog has often cited the excellent work of Arvind Narayanan at Princeton. His colleague Mihir Kshirsagar posted an equally excellent piece on the implications of inadequate depreciation for competition entitled <a href="https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2025/10/15/lifespan-of-ai-chips-the-300-billion-question/"><i>Lifespan of AI Chips: The $300 Billion Question</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        What I have found so far is surprising. It appears that we’re making important decisions about who gets to compete in AI based on financial assumptions that may be systematically overstating the long-run sustainability of the industry by a factor of two.
        </blockquote>
        Kshirsagar has identified inadequate depreciation as a key part of what I have called "<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html">the drug-dealer's algorithm</a>" (<i>the first one's free</i>):<br />
        <blockquote>
        Incumbent coalitions—hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) partnered with their model developers (OpenAI, Anthropic)—can effectively subsidize application-layer pricing during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. This could create advantages that prove insurmountable even when better technology becomes available.<br />
        <br />
        The core issue isn’t whether chips wear out faster than accounting suggests. It’s whether the market structure being formed is fueled by accounting conventions that obscure true long-run economics, allowing incumbent coalitions to establish customer lock-in at the application layer before true costs become visible. In other words, the accounting subsidy creates a window of roughly three to six years where reported costs are artificially low. After that, the overlapping depreciation schedules catch up to operational reality. Here’s why this timing matters: that three-to-six-year window is precisely when the market structure for AI applications is being determined. Customer relationships are being formed. Enterprise integrations are being built. Multi-year contracts are being signed. Switching costs are accumulating. By the time the accounting catches up—when companies face the full weight of replacement costs hitting their income statements—the incumbent coalitions will have already locked in their customer base. The temporary subsidy enables permanent competitive advantage. 
        </blockquote>
        Kshirsagar goes on to examine the effects of the drug-dealers algorithm in considerable detail. I encourage you to read the whole post, although I have a few quibbles:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>He focuses on enterprise use of AI as the platform's business model, and seems to assume that enterprises will find that using AI generates enough value to cover the subsidized cost through the lock-in period. Given the negative productivity impact most enterprises currently report, this is not a safe assumption.</li>
        <li>Even if management's infatuation with AI, and the prospect of firing all their <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/07/the-selling-of-ai.html">annoying employees</a>, results in their being locked in to the AI platform of their choice, they will need to achieve massive productivity gains to be able to afford what the platforms will have to charge to raise the <a href="https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/20252/$2-trillion-in-new-revenue-needed-to-fund-ais-scaling-trend---bain--companys-6th-annual-global-technology-report/">$2T/year in revenue</a> they will need.</li>
        <li>The AI platforms have already figured out that enterprise use isn't likely to generate enough revenue and are pivoting to advertising, affiliate marketing and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/erotica-coming-to-chatgpt-this-year-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman.html">porn</a>.</li>
        <li>There is an elephant in the room, namely the vastly increased attack surface AI provides. For example, we have Benji Edwards' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-models-can-acquire-backdoors-from-surprisingly-few-malicious-documents/"><i>AI models can acquire backdoors from surprisingly few malicious documents</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        researchers from Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute released a preprint research paper suggesting that large language models like the ones that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can develop backdoor vulnerabilities from as few as 250 corrupted documents inserted into their training data.
        </blockquote>
        And David Gerard's <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/10/14/its-trivial-to-prompt-inject-githubs-ai-copilot-chat/"><i>It’s trivial to prompt-inject Github’s AI Copilot Chat</i></a>:
        <blockquote>
        Mayraz’s question was: can we send a pull request — a suggested code fix — that contains a prompt injection? And make the bot spill sensitive user data, like private code or AWS login keys? Yes, we can!<br />
        ...<br />
        Mayraz’s exploit was a rediscovery of an exploit GitHub had already been told about. User 49016 discovered the bug a few months before and reported it on HackerOne. GitHub acknowledged the report and called it a “low risk” issue — “yes, they <i>seriously</i> consider a LLM leaking your private repo contents as a ‘low risk issue’.” (Mayraz’s CVE filing was rated a 9.6.) 49016 reports that GitHub’s fix is rubbish, and “bypassing it took 5 minutes lol.”

        Want an Nvidia B200 GPU accelerator? Buying one on its release in late 2024 would’ve probably cost around $50,000, which is before all the costs associated with plugging it in and switching it on. Yet by early 2025, the same hardware could be rented for around $3.20 an hour. By last month, the B200’s floor price had fallen to $2.80 per hour.

        That is weird. If the economic life of a B200 is 2 years at $2.80/hour it would earn only $49K, or its purchase price.  But Elder explains that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9">it isn't that simple</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        What might be less obvious is that among the hyperscalers — Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Google and Oracle — prices have hardly budged. The result is an ever-widening gap between rates charged by the big-four and a growing number of smaller rivals.<br />
        <br />
        Here’s the same RBC data organised to show relative pricing across all GPUs. The iceberg effect shows how much it’s new entrants driving average rates lower. Meanwhile, for a hyperscaler customers, this month’s bill per GPU will almost always be the same as last month’s bill

        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>A lot of pandemic-era Nvidia GPUs will be heading towards Cash Converters having never washed their face.</li>
        <li>The customers attracted by low AI compute costs have yet to show much ability, willingness or inclination to pay more.</li>
        <li>The hyperscalers don’t believe these customers are worth competing for, so have chosen to wait for the discount end of the market to die of insolvency.</li>
        <li>The inevitable data-centre shakeout will kill lots of AI start-ups that can’t afford to pay what compute actually costs.</li>
        <li>We might be overestimating the size of the GPU market if the middle-ground — meaning regular companies that want OpenAI and Anthropic to make their chatbots, summarisation tools and similar AI widgets — turns out to be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce">worth less than $3tn</a>.</li>

        Those are all good points.<br />
        <h3>Update</h3>
        I need to update today's post to cover two important posts I missed:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>Will Lockett's <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7"><i>The AI Bubble Is Far Worse Than We Thought</i></a> from 13<sup>th</sup> October. It describes the size of the debt fuelling the AI platform's tsunami of spending.</li>
        <li>Ed Zitron's <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/"><i>This Is How Much Anthropic and Cursor Spend On Amazon Web Services</i></a> from yesterday. It provides evidence for their vast excess of costs over income.</li>
        </ul>
        Together, they greatly amplify the message that when the IA bubble bursts, the damage will not be confined to the AI platforms, or even to technology stocks, but it will impact the banks and private capital lenders.<br />
        <h4>Will Lockett</h4>
        Lockett starts from an analysis by Julien Garran of MacroStrategy Partnership, pointing to the mismatch between the enormous investments the AI platforms are making and the lack of any sustainable business model to generate the <a href="https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/20252/$2-trillion-in-new-revenue-needed-to-fund-ais-scaling-trend---bain--companys-6th-annual-global-technology-report/">$2T/year in new revenue</a> needed to provide a return.<br />
        <br />
        So far, Garran's analysis is hardly original, <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">but</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Garran used the economic analysis pioneered by economist Knut Wicksell to establish the size of this investing discrepancy, the 2008 bubble, and the dot-com bubble, and that is how he learned that <b>the AI bubble is currently four times the size of the 2008 bubble at its peak!</b>
        </blockquote>
        Lockett asks "<a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">is the AI bubble as connected to the outside world?</a>":<br />
        <blockquote>
        It seems AI companies have been growing through equity financing (selling shares of the company) rather than debt financing (borrowing money). Furthermore, investment seems to be incestuous to the tech industry; for example, OpenAI’s major investors are Microsoft and Nvidia. As such, many believed that the AI bubble is actually relatively isolated from the rest of the economy and therefore might not have as significant an impact on the wider economy when it bursts.
        </blockquote>
        It turns out that a large slice of the bubble spending <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">isn't equity</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Dario Perkins, managing director of global macro at TS Lombard, has found that many AI companies are increasingly using SPVs to raise significant amounts of debt financing off the books. This covers their tracks and obfuscates the debt, making it “look” like the company is running on equity finance instead. Due to this, it is incredibly difficult to get an accurate figure on how much of the AI industry’s expenditure and growth comes from debt — but we know it is a lot!
        </blockquote>
        Even the "on the books" debt <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">is a lot</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Goldman Sachs has found that at least $141 billion of the $500 billion in capital expenses the AI industry has spent so far this year came from debt directly tied to the main corporate body through corporate credit issuances. To give you an idea of how insane that is, the entire AI industry capital expenditure in 2024 was $127 billion. In other words, the AI industry has taken on significantly more debt so far this year than it ever spent in total last year. This also means that we know that about 30% of the AI industry’s annual expenditure for this year came from “on the books” debt.
        </blockquote>
        And there is plenty of <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">"off the books" debt</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        We know that Meta is looking to raise $26 billion in debt through an SPV by the end of the year. This one deal equates to 5% of the total AI industry’s capital expenditure for this year.
        </blockquote>
        You have to wonder what collateral is backing this "at least" $167B in debt, and how it is being depreciated.<br />
        <h4>Ed Zitron</h4>
        Some of the AI platforms have non-AI free cash flows that can be diverted to paying the interest on these debts, or that could be if they hadn't already been shoveled into the AI investment cash furnace. But OpenAI, Anthropic and the other pure-play AI platforms don't. In order to pay the interest without needing to raise more equity, they need to be cash flow positive. Zitron has always been skeptical that they can be, for example <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/">writing</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.
        </blockquote>
        Now, Zitron has strong evidence that <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">he was right</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of their AWS billing, I am able to disclose the amounts that AI firms are spending, specifically Anthropic and AI coding company Cursor, <a href="https://www.vincentschmalbach.com/cursor-is-anthropics-largest-customer-and-maxing-out-their-gpus/">its largest customer</a>.<br />
        <br />
        I can exclusively reveal today Anthropic’s spending on Amazon Web Services for the entirety of 2024, and for every month in 2025 up until September, and that that Anthropic’s spend on compute far exceeds that previously reported. 
        </blockquote>
        Zitron can <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">confirm that</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Anthropic has spent more than 100% of its estimated revenue (based on reporting in the last year) on Amazon Web Services, spending $2.66 billion on compute on an estimated $2.55 billion in revenue.
        </blockquote>
        And what about <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">Cursor?</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Additionally, Cursor’s Amazon Web Services bills more than doubled from $6.2 million in May 2025 to $12.6 million in June 2025, exacerbating a cash crunch that began when Anthropic introduced Priority Service Tiers, an aggressive rent-seeking measure that begun what I call the Subprime AI Crisis, where model providers begin jacking up the prices on their previously subsidized rates.<br />
        <br />
        Although Cursor obtains the majority of its compute from Anthropic — with AWS contributing a relatively small amount, and likely also taking care of other parts of its business — the data seen reveals an overall direction of travel, where the costs of compute <i>only keep on going up</i>. 
        </blockquote>
        Last year Anthropic likely spent more than <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/"><i>ten times its revenue</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        In February of this year, The information reported that Anthropic burned $5.6 billion in 2024, and made somewhere between $400 million and $600 million in revenue<br />
        ...<br />
        I can confirm from a source with direct knowledge of billing that Anthropic spent $1.35 billion on Amazon Web Services in 2024, and has already spent $2.66 billion on Amazon Web Services through the end of September.<br />
        <br />
        Assuming that Anthropic made $600 million in revenue, this means that Anthropic spent $6.2 billion in 2024, leaving $4.85 billion in costs unaccounted for.
        </blockquote>
        Zitron notes that Anthropic is "<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">making it up in volume</a>":<br />
        <blockquote>
        Based on what I have been party to, the more successful Anthropic becomes, the more its services cost. <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue-with-an-ai-booster/#if-you-plotted-the-curve-of-how-the-cost-of-inference-has-been-falling-over-time-%E2%80%94-false-the-cost-of-inference-has-gone-up-over-time">The cost of inference is clearly increasing for customers</a>, but based on its escalating monthly costs, the cost of inference appears to be high for Anthropic too, though it’s impossible to tell how much of its compute is based on training versus running inference.
        </blockquote>
        While it is true that training these very large models is expensive, it is a one-time cost to be amortized against the huge number of inferences made against the trained model. Alas, the huge number is so huge that it <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/">dominates the one-time cost</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference. 
        </blockquote>
        Which explains Zitron's <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">observation that</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        these costs seem to increase with the amount of money Anthropic makes, meaning that the current pricing of both subscriptions and API access seems unprofitable, and must increase dramatically — from my calculations, a 100% price increase might work, but good luck retaining every single customer and their customers too! — for this company to ever become sustainable. 
        </blockquote>
        This confirms my prediction of price increases in June's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html"><i>The Back Of The AI Envelope</i></a>.<br />
        <br />
        Zitron's post is long, detailed and very much worth reading. Go and read it.<br />

More than three years ago, based on Paul Butler&#39;s [_The problem with bitcoin miners_](https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/), I wrote [_Generally Accepted Accounting Principles_](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html). The TL;DR was that the economic life of Bitcoin mining rigs was estimated at [16 months](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901), as Moore&#39;s law in a competitive ASIC market rapidly generated more power-efficient rigs. But the Bitcoin miners&#39; accounts were using 5-year straight-line depreciation for their rigs, which was significantly increasing their nominal profits.

Below the fold I look at the same problem unfolding in the heart of the AI bubble.

Six months after we started Nvidia we knew over thirty other startups trying to build graphics chips for the PC. A major reason that only ATI survived was that, after the second chip, Nvidia released a better chip every six months like clockwork. I explained the technology that made, and still makes, this possible in [_The Dawn Of Nvidia&#39;s Technology_](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/05/the-dawn-of-nvidias-technology.html), but in the long term equally important was that the idea of a fixed cadence got built into the company&#39;s culture, and this now applies not just to graphics chips but also to [AI chips](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud):

&#62; Last year Nvidia, ..., said it would unveil a fresh AI chip every year rather than every couple of years. In March its boss, Jensen Huang, remarked that “when Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn’t give Hoppers away,” referring to Nvidia’s latest chips and their predecessors, respectively.

The systems are estimated to be more than half the capex for a new data center. Much of its opex is power. Just as with mining rigs, the key feature of each successive generation of AI chips is that it is more efficient at using power. But that doesn&#39;t mean they use less power, they use more but less per operation. The need for enhanced power distribution and the concomitant cooling is what has prevented new AI systems being installed in legacy data centers. Presumably the next few generations will be compatible with current state of the art data center infrastructure, so they can directly replace their predecessors and thereby reduce costs.

It is often assumed that the majority of the opex of AI platforms goes into training, which is a once per generation cost that can be amortized over the huge number of inference operations needed to answer prompts. But as James O&#39;Donnell and Casey Crownhart report in [_We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard._](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/):

&#62; As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.

So 80-90% of the opex is per-query, which makes improving system efficiency critical to reducing the torrent of cash these platforms are hemorrhaging. Ed Zitron [estimated that](https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/):

&#62; To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.

This makes Jensen&#39;s quip somewhat credible.

A month ago I missed _The Economist&#39;s_ discovery of the AI version of [Paul Butler&#39;s Bitcoin post](https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/), entitled [_The $4trn accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud_](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud). The cost of these rapidly depreciating assets is huge:

&#62; AI revenues and expenditures are likewise a 13-figure affair nowadays. Worldwide spending on AI hardware and software nudged $1trn last year, according to Gartner, a research firm. This is likely to double to $2trn in 2026. Between 2024 and 2026 the five listed AI powerhouses will have splurged over $1trn on capital investments, chiefly AI data centres. A slug will end up with Nvidia and Broadcom, which furnish them and others with AI semiconductors. The duo (combined market capitalisation: $6trn) are together forecast to book almost $1trn in sales over that period.

The platforms haven&#39;t been depreciating these assets at [realistic rates](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud):

&#62; biggest customers have in recent times been raising their servers’ lifetimes, reducing depreciation charges in their accounts. Microsoft pushed it up from four to six years in 2022. Alphabet did the same in 2023. Amazon and Oracle changed it from five to six in 2024. And in January Meta moved from five to five and a half years.

The reason for these accounting games is that they make a significant [difference to the bottom line](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud):

&#62; Amazon reversed course and moved back to five years for some kit, noting this would cut operating profit in 2025 by $700m, or about 1%, owing to a higher depreciation expense. Given the rapid advances in chipmaking, that seems optimistic. And Amazon’s AI rivals clinging to their elongated depreciation schedules look Pollyannaish. In July Jim Chanos, a veteran short-seller, posted that if the true economic lifespan of Meta’s AI chips is two to three years, then “most of its ‘profits’ are materially overstated.” A recent analysis of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta by Barclays, a bank, estimated that higher depreciation costs would shave 5-10% from their earnings per share.

And thus to their stock price. If they went to a [3-year straight-line depreciation](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud):

&#62; At the five companies’ current ratio of market capitalisation to pre-tax profit, this would amount to a $780bn knock to their combined value. Redo the sums depreciating the servers over two years instead of three and the size of the hit rises to $1.6trn. Take Mr Huang literally, and you get a staggering $4trn, equivalent to one-third of their collective worth.

A big chunk of the AI platforms&#39; investment in the hardware is financed with debt. If the lenders are using a five-year life when valuing the hardware as collateral they will run into trouble too. It is rumored that Macquairie was lending against GPUs using a seven-year life.

But as Paul Butler pointed out, straight-line depreciation over-estimates the value of older but not yet uneconomic assets. I described [Butler&#39;s graph](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html):

&#62; Butler uses historical hash rate data to compute the actual depreciation curves for mining hardware, plotting the percentage of the initial bitcoin production rate against time in quarters for each quarter since Bitcoin&#39;s inception. The graph shows that initially (bluest lines), when GPUs were introduced, they stopped producing after about 5 quarters. Recently (magenta-est lines), ASICs last longer, stopping producing after about 4 years. But for the whole of Bitcoin&#39;s existence the hardware has depreciated far faster than the GAAP&#39;s five year straight line.

But I [argued that it was too optimstic](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html):

&#62; He assumes that the ASICs are obsolete when they can no longer keep up with the hash rate so are no longer mining any Bitcoin. That is wrong. ASICs are obsolete when the Bitcoin they mine _no longer pay for the electricity they use_. The newer ASICs aren&#39;t just faster, they also use much less energy per hash. Look again at the depreciation graph, which suggests current ASICs go obsolete after 16 quarters. But [Alex de Vries and Christian Stoll&#39;s estimate](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901) of 5 quarters to obsolescence is based on comparing the ASIC&#39;s production with the cost of their power consumption, which is the correct approach. The curves in the graph are correct out to the 40% line, but then should drop to zero.

Similarly, at some point in the future when the AI platforms realize they need a return on their investments, running systems answering queries that earn less than the cost of the power will no longer make sense and their value will drop precipitously.

If hardware is being used as collateral for a loan the value should represent what it would fetch on the market. Assume Nvidia is on a 2-year cadence. Customers don&#39;t get their hardware instantly, so assume that the borrower got theirs 6 months into the 2 years. They default after 1 year, so the bank is selling hardware with 6 months left before the next generation starts shipping, and 1 year before a typical customer can get hardware that renders the current hardware almost uneconomic. The lender&#39;s 5-year straight-line estimate of value would be 80% of the purchase price. A buyer would likely estimate 20% of the purchase price.

This blog has often cited the excellent work of Arvind Narayanan at Princeton. His colleague Mihir Kshirsagar posted an equally excellent piece on the implications of inadequate depreciation for competition entitled [_Lifespan of AI Chips: The $300 Billion Question_](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2025/10/15/lifespan-of-ai-chips-the-300-billion-question/):

&#62; What I have found so far is surprising. It appears that we’re making important decisions about who gets to compete in AI based on financial assumptions that may be systematically overstating the long-run sustainability of the industry by a factor of two.

Kshirsagar has identified inadequate depreciation as a key part of what I have called &#34; [the drug-dealer&#39;s algorithm](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html)&#34; ( _the first one&#39;s free_):

&#62; Incumbent coalitions—hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) partnered with their model developers (OpenAI, Anthropic)—can effectively subsidize application-layer pricing during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. This could create advantages that prove insurmountable even when better technology becomes available.
&#62;
&#62; The core issue isn’t whether chips wear out faster than accounting suggests. It’s whether the market structure being formed is fueled by accounting conventions that obscure true long-run economics, allowing incumbent coalitions to establish customer lock-in at the application layer before true costs become visible. In other words, the accounting subsidy creates a window of roughly three to six years where reported costs are artificially low. After that, the overlapping depreciation schedules catch up to operational reality. Here’s why this timing matters: that three-to-six-year window is precisely when the market structure for AI applications is being determined. Customer relationships are being formed. Enterprise integrations are being built. Multi-year contracts are being signed. Switching costs are accumulating. By the time the accounting catches up—when companies face the full weight of replacement costs hitting their income statements—the incumbent coalitions will have already locked in their customer base. The temporary subsidy enables permanent competitive advantage.

Kshirsagar goes on to examine the effects of the drug-dealers algorithm in considerable detail. I encourage you to read the whole post, although I have a few quibbles:

- He focuses on enterprise use of AI as the platform&#39;s business model, and seems to assume that enterprises will find that using AI generates enough value to cover the subsidized cost through the lock-in period. Given the negative productivity impact most enterprises currently report, this is not a safe assumption.
- Even if management&#39;s infatuation with AI, and the prospect of firing all their [annoying employees](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/07/the-selling-of-ai.html), results in their being locked in to the AI platform of their choice, they will need to achieve massive productivity gains to be able to afford what the platforms will have to charge to raise the [$2T/year in revenue](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/20252/$2-trillion-in-new-revenue-needed-to-fund-ais-scaling-trend---bain--companys-6th-annual-global-technology-report/) they will need.
- The AI platforms have already figured out that enterprise use isn&#39;t likely to generate enough revenue and are pivoting to advertising, affiliate marketing and [porn](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/erotica-coming-to-chatgpt-this-year-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman.html).
- There is an elephant in the room, namely the vastly increased attack surface AI provides. For example, we have Benji Edwards&#39; [_AI models can acquire backdoors from surprisingly few malicious documents_](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-models-can-acquire-backdoors-from-surprisingly-few-malicious-documents/):



  &#62; researchers from Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute released a preprint research paper suggesting that large language models like the ones that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can develop backdoor vulnerabilities from as few as 250 corrupted documents inserted into their training data.


  And David Gerard&#39;s [_It’s trivial to prompt-inject Github’s AI Copilot Chat_](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/10/14/its-trivial-to-prompt-inject-githubs-ai-copilot-chat/):


  &#62; Mayraz’s question was: can we send a pull request — a suggested code fix — that contains a prompt injection? And make the bot spill sensitive user data, like private code or AWS login keys? Yes, we can!
  &#62;
  &#62; ...
  &#62;
  &#62; Mayraz’s exploit was a rediscovery of an exploit GitHub had already been told about. User 49016 discovered the bug a few months before and reported it on HackerOne. GitHub acknowledged the report and called it a “low risk” issue — “yes, they _seriously_ consider a LLM leaking your private repo contents as a ‘low risk issue’.” (Mayraz’s CVE filing was rated a 9.6.) 49016 reports that GitHub’s fix is rubbish, and “bypassing it took 5 minutes lol.”

  &#62; a $4,000 desktop AI computer that wraps one petaflop of computing performance and 128GB of unified memory into a form factor small enough to sit on a desk.
  &#62;
  &#62; ...
  &#62;
  &#62; Nvidia’s Spark reportedly includes enough memory to run larger-than-typical AI models for local tasks, with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models containing up to 70 billion parameters without requiring remote infrastructure. Potential uses include running larger open-weights language models and media synthesis models such as AI image generators.


  The system is the tiny gold box in the image. It is based on Blackwell.

Related to Kshirsagar&#39;s analysis of the effectiveness of lock-in is Bryce Elder&#39;s [_What GPU pricing can tell us about how the AI bubble will pop_](https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9):

&#62; One odd thing about AI equipment is that it’s very expensive to buy and very cheap to rent.
&#62;
&#62; Want an Nvidia B200 GPU accelerator? Buying one on its release in late 2024 would’ve probably cost around $50,000, which is before all the costs associated with plugging it in and switching it on. Yet by early 2025, the same hardware could be rented for around $3.20 an hour. By last month, the B200’s floor price had fallen to $2.80 per hour.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0ZwZ2d1tfF5doM7EiLEMtVmQf6QmYJWV7zIJkLQYQtcpNOl7I8yCxnF4x9ul869SUbNSSsMB6A9Kl6P838Sz8z2wOqkv0_JW2NRlxXZInL5ogOIGBn2mrgt5bvRyIMYyLm6fHYz1HlAbVnNayz-AZZur5g3vjB88mYNs26gB2i-wnftL2MbCdK-E3G99Y/w200-h129/RelativeRental.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0ZwZ2d1tfF5doM7EiLEMtVmQf6QmYJWV7zIJkLQYQtcpNOl7I8yCxnF4x9ul869SUbNSSsMB6A9Kl6P838Sz8z2wOqkv0_JW2NRlxXZInL5ogOIGBn2mrgt5bvRyIMYyLm6fHYz1HlAbVnNayz-AZZur5g3vjB88mYNs26gB2i-wnftL2MbCdK-E3G99Y/s1586/RelativeRental.png)[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9)
That is weird. If the economic life of a B200 is 2 years at $2.80/hour it would earn only $49K, or its purchase price. But Elder explains that [it isn&#39;t that simple](https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9):

&#62; What might be less obvious is that among the hyperscalers — Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Google and Oracle — prices have hardly budged. The result is an ever-widening gap between rates charged by the big-four and a growing number of smaller rivals.
&#62;
&#62; Here’s the same RBC data organised to show relative pricing across all GPUs. The iceberg effect shows how much it’s new entrants driving average rates lower. Meanwhile, for a hyperscaler customers, this month’s bill per GPU will almost always be the same as last month’s bill

Elder ends with a set of [possible conclusions](https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9):

&#62; - A lot of pandemic-era Nvidia GPUs will be heading towards Cash Converters having never washed their face.
&#62; - The customers attracted by low AI compute costs have yet to show much ability, willingness or inclination to pay more.
&#62; - The hyperscalers don’t believe these customers are worth competing for, so have chosen to wait for the discount end of the market to die of insolvency.
&#62; - The inevitable data-centre shakeout will kill lots of AI start-ups that can’t afford to pay what compute actually costs.
&#62; - We might be overestimating the size of the GPU market if the middle-ground — meaning regular companies that want OpenAI and Anthropic to make their chatbots, summarisation tools and similar AI widgets — turns out to be [worth less than $3tn](https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce).

Those are all good points.

### Update

I need to update today&#39;s post to cover two important posts I missed:

- Will Lockett&#39;s [_The AI Bubble Is Far Worse Than We Thought_](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7) from 13th October. It describes the size of the debt fuelling the AI platform&#39;s tsunami of spending.
- Ed Zitron&#39;s [_This Is How Much Anthropic and Cursor Spend On Amazon Web Services_](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/) from yesterday. It provides evidence for their vast excess of costs over income.

Together, they greatly amplify the message that when the IA bubble bursts, the damage will not be confined to the AI platforms, or even to technology stocks, but it will impact the banks and private capital lenders.

#### Will Lockett

Lockett starts from an analysis by Julien Garran of MacroStrategy Partnership, pointing to the mismatch between the enormous investments the AI platforms are making and the lack of any sustainable business model to generate the [$2T/year in new revenue](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/20252/$2-trillion-in-new-revenue-needed-to-fund-ais-scaling-trend---bain--companys-6th-annual-global-technology-report/) needed to provide a return.

So far, Garran&#39;s analysis is hardly original, [but](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7):

&#62; Garran used the economic analysis pioneered by economist Knut Wicksell to establish the size of this investing discrepancy, the 2008 bubble, and the dot-com bubble, and that is how he learned that **the AI bubble is currently four times the size of the 2008 bubble at its peak!**

Lockett asks &#34; [is the AI bubble as connected to the outside world?](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7)&#34;:

&#62; It seems AI companies have been growing through equity financing (selling shares of the company) rather than debt financing (borrowing money). Furthermore, investment seems to be incestuous to the tech industry; for example, OpenAI’s major investors are Microsoft and Nvidia. As such, many believed that the AI bubble is actually relatively isolated from the rest of the economy and therefore might not have as significant an impact on the wider economy when it bursts.

It turns out that a large slice of the bubble spending [isn&#39;t equity](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7):

&#62; Dario Perkins, managing director of global macro at TS Lombard, has found that many AI companies are increasingly using SPVs to raise significant amounts of debt financing off the books. This covers their tracks and obfuscates the debt, making it “look” like the company is running on equity finance instead. Due to this, it is incredibly difficult to get an accurate figure on how much of the AI industry’s expenditure and growth comes from debt — but we know it is a lot!

Even the &#34;on the books&#34; debt [is a lot](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7):

&#62; Goldman Sachs has found that at least $141 billion of the $500 billion in capital expenses the AI industry has spent so far this year came from debt directly tied to the main corporate body through corporate credit issuances. To give you an idea of how insane that is, the entire AI industry capital expenditure in 2024 was $127 billion. In other words, the AI industry has taken on significantly more debt so far this year than it ever spent in total last year. This also means that we know that about 30% of the AI industry’s annual expenditure for this year came from “on the books” debt.

And there is plenty of [&#34;off the books&#34; debt](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7):

&#62; We know that Meta is looking to raise $26 billion in debt through an SPV by the end of the year. This one deal equates to 5% of the total AI industry’s capital expenditure for this year.

You have to wonder what collateral is backing this &#34;at least&#34; $167B in debt, and how it is being depreciated.

#### Ed Zitron

Some of the AI platforms have non-AI free cash flows that can be diverted to paying the interest on these debts, or that could be if they hadn&#39;t already been shoveled into the AI investment cash furnace. But OpenAI, Anthropic and the other pure-play AI platforms don&#39;t. In order to pay the interest without needing to raise more equity, they need to be cash flow positive. Zitron has always been skeptical that they can be, for example [writing](https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/):

&#62; To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.

Now, Zitron has strong evidence that [he was right](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of their AWS billing, I am able to disclose the amounts that AI firms are spending, specifically Anthropic and AI coding company Cursor, [its largest customer](https://www.vincentschmalbach.com/cursor-is-anthropics-largest-customer-and-maxing-out-their-gpus/).
&#62;
&#62; I can exclusively reveal today Anthropic’s spending on Amazon Web Services for the entirety of 2024, and for every month in 2025 up until September, and that that Anthropic’s spend on compute far exceeds that previously reported.

Zitron can [confirm that](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; Anthropic has spent more than 100% of its estimated revenue (based on reporting in the last year) on Amazon Web Services, spending $2.66 billion on compute on an estimated $2.55 billion in revenue.

And what about [Cursor?](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; Additionally, Cursor’s Amazon Web Services bills more than doubled from $6.2 million in May 2025 to $12.6 million in June 2025, exacerbating a cash crunch that began when Anthropic introduced Priority Service Tiers, an aggressive rent-seeking measure that begun what I call the Subprime AI Crisis, where model providers begin jacking up the prices on their previously subsidized rates.
&#62;
&#62; Although Cursor obtains the majority of its compute from Anthropic — with AWS contributing a relatively small amount, and likely also taking care of other parts of its business — the data seen reveals an overall direction of travel, where the costs of compute _only keep on going up_.

Last year Anthropic likely spent more than [_ten times its revenue_](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; In February of this year, The information reported that Anthropic burned $5.6 billion in 2024, and made somewhere between $400 million and $600 million in revenue
&#62;
&#62; ...
&#62;
&#62; I can confirm from a source with direct knowledge of billing that Anthropic spent $1.35 billion on Amazon Web Services in 2024, and has already spent $2.66 billion on Amazon Web Services through the end of September.
&#62;
&#62; Assuming that Anthropic made $600 million in revenue, this means that Anthropic spent $6.2 billion in 2024, leaving $4.85 billion in costs unaccounted for.

Zitron notes that Anthropic is &#34; [making it up in volume](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/)&#34;:

&#62; Based on what I have been party to, the more successful Anthropic becomes, the more its services cost. [The cost of inference is clearly increasing for customers](https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue-with-an-ai-booster/#if-you-plotted-the-curve-of-how-the-cost-of-inference-has-been-falling-over-time-%E2%80%94-false-the-cost-of-inference-has-gone-up-over-time), but based on its escalating monthly costs, the cost of inference appears to be high for Anthropic too, though it’s impossible to tell how much of its compute is based on training versus running inference.

While it is true that training these very large models is expensive, it is a one-time cost to be amortized against the huge number of inferences made against the trained model. Alas, the huge number is so huge that it [dominates the one-time cost](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/):

&#62; As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.

Which explains Zitron&#39;s [observation that](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; these costs seem to increase with the amount of money Anthropic makes, meaning that the current pricing of both subscriptions and API access seems unprofitable, and must increase dramatically — from my calculations, a 100% price increase might work, but good luck retaining every single customer and their customers too! — for this company to ever become sustainable.

This confirms my prediction of price increases in June&#39;s [_The Back Of The AI Envelope_](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html).

Zitron&#39;s post is long, detailed and very much worth reading. Go and read it.</source:markdown>

        <p>I’m reposting <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye" title="@mhoye@mastodon.social">@mhoye</a>’s brilliant answers to <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/public-consultations/help-define-next-chapter-canadas-ai-leadership">a consultation</a> on Canada’s “AI leadership”. (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye/115389752400985454">Source</a>)</p>
        
        <p>The answers apply to all countries, needless to say.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-efforts-are-needed-to-attract-develop-and-retain-top-ai-talent-across-research-industry-and-the-public-sector">What efforts are needed to attract, develop and retain top AI talent across research, industry and the public sector?</h2>
        
        <p>Universal basic income. Excellent health care. Well-funded, accessible universities. Affordable housing. Clean, safe streets achieved by housing the homeless and sheltering and treating the addicted and mentally ill instead of punishing them. Thriving artistic communities in welcoming, multicultural cities. Progressive pricing for the fundamental necessities of life, like energy and shelter.</p>
        
        <p>Any computer can be operated remotely, over any distance, from any other computer. I&rsquo;m doing that right now by filling out this form. You&rsquo;re doing it right now by reading what I&rsquo;ve typed. Where the hardware is plugged in doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. If we want to foster and retain talented researchers, practitioners and public administrators in Canada, then we need to build communities where young people starting their careers can afford to live, where people growing their careers want to live, and where people in the prime of their careers are happy to live.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-are-the-key-barriers-to-ai-adoption-and-how-can-government-and-industry-work-together-to-accelerate-responsible-uptake">What are the key barriers to AI adoption, and how can government and industry work together to accelerate responsible uptake?</h2>
        
        <p>Right now the key barrier to AI adoption is that the people pushing it the hardest are absolutely the least trustworthy people on the planet, with a small army of epistemologically-adrift FOMO-addled C-levels rolling up fast behind them, and it&rsquo;s being pushed into products and people&rsquo;s working processes with no regard to utility or productivity at all. Right now, the overarching purpose of large-model AI is not &ldquo;improved productivity&rdquo; or &ldquo;reduced error rates&rdquo;, it is consuming enough computing resources, through whatever means necessary, that demand for computing stays high enough that the sector can keep their historic high-double-digit growth and returns going, and avoid turning into a commodified utility. But real-world uptake in most of these nonviable scenarios is close to zero and compute as a commodified uitility is where this is going.</p>
        
        <p>Accelerating <em>responsible</em> uptake means a measured approach, using consentfully obtained and carefully curated data to accomplish empirically sound and morally justifiable goals without freeing any person or organization using them from accountability for their actions. This means legal and regulatory frameworks with spine and teeth that understand what safe and consentful mean and impose meaningful costs for failing to meet those standards, and it means investing in historically-undervalued areas like criticism, curation and library sciences as foundational skillsets.</p>
        
        <p>When people depend on their tools – not just use but depend – then the liability avoidance that is absolutely endemic in computing is completely unacceptable. Car companies are simply not permitted to say, if it breaks you can keep both pieces. And it is <em>the imposition of liability</em> that has driven almost all of the modern innovations in automotive quality and safety. AI, and tech in general, needs those constrains in order to thrive.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-needs-to-be-put-in-place-so-canada-can-grow-globally-competitive-ai-companies-while-retaining-ownership-ip-and-economic-sovereignty">What needs to be put in place so Canada can grow globally competitive AI companies while retaining ownership, IP and economic sovereignty?</h2>
        
        <p>Again, I am begging you to understand two things: that any computer anywhere in the world can be operated remotely from any other computer anywhere in the world, and that landlords are a dead weight loss to society.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to foster Canadian innovation and champion Canadian companies, any approach to this that involves business incentives and lets the rentier class thrive is – inevitably, mathematically – a race to the bottom.</p>
        
        <p>If you want a new Renaissance, you have to build the new Vienna.</p>
        
        <p>If you want innovative new technologies to exist, you <em>need</em> to create communities where it is safe to fail. You need to create a society where the opportunity to, the ability to, and the tools to experiment are not the sole domain of already comfortable and already privileged. We know what those experiments look like already, they look like Mark Zuckerberg spending eighty billion dollars on the Metaverse and another eighty billion dollars on pretend chatbot friends and it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all and nobody cares.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to be the place that people go to build the future, you have to bet on people and build a place they&rsquo;ll believe is worth living in while they try to build that future.</p>
        
        <p>Invest in the arts, invest in the culture, invest in affordable housing and health care and tax the rentier class to fund those investments.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-can-canada-better-connect-ai-research-with-commercialization-to-meet-strategic-business-needs">How can Canada better connect AI research with commercialization to meet strategic business needs?</h2>
        
        <p>This is a waste of time and effort.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;Strategic business needs&rdquo; are near-term problems whose contours and desired outcomes are known, where the remaining questions are about effective execution. Research is a long-term exploration whose results are always uncertain, but that sometimes pay off in wholly unexpected ways, even creating wholly unexpected markets.</p>
        
        <p>When the microwave was invented, not only was there no market for microwaves, but every single kitchen in the world already had a way to heat up water in it. It would have been the easiest thing in the world to say, what&rsquo;s the point of that, get back to work on stuff that matters.</p>
        
        <p>Focusing on the commercialization of research is the absolute latest part of the process. If you want real innovation, fund speculation. When something interesting comes of it, you&rsquo;ll get the commercialization for free in a few years.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-lessons-can-we-learn-from-countries-that-are-successful-at-investment-attraction-in-ai-and-tech-both-from-domestic-sources-and-from-foreign-capital">What lessons can we learn from countries that are successful at investment attraction in AI and tech, both from domestic sources and from foreign capital?</h2>
        
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        
        <p>Right now, we can nothing from countries that are funding their own democratic, economic and ecological destruction by spending billion on circular investments into bubble markets without a real customer in sight, weaponizing automation against their working and minority classes and building vast data warehouses that will demand more electricity and water than their entire regions have available while driving the citizen&rsquo;s cost of both through the roof.</p>
        
        <p>We can learn nothing from them except how not to approach it and what not to do.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-can-canada-build-public-trust-in-ai-technologies-while-addressing-the-risks-they-present-what-are-the-most-important-things-to-do-to-build-confidence">How can Canada build public trust in AI technologies while addressing the risks they present? What are the most important things to do to build confidence?</h2>
        
        <p>Consentfully obtained, accountably auditable training data, transparent (and open source) training techniques, and most importantly: liability.</p>
        
        <p>Most of our debates about freedom and safety are framed in terms of &ldquo;freedom to&rdquo;, and the arguments are about the limitations on those freedoms. If you&rsquo;re luckier than me, those conversations might even involve &ldquo;freedom from&rdquo;.</p>
        
        <p>But what if we lived in a society where that wasn&rsquo;t enough? Where government had a positive obligation to not just permit freedom to, but defend the possibility of? To mandate and enforce standards saying you must be free from the possibility of specific kinds of failure?</p>
        
        <p>We already have that for cars, of course.</p>
        
        <p>The full text of CRC c.1038, the Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations section of the Consolidated Regulations of Canada, runs a full megabyte of text. The Ontario Provincial Standards for Roads &amp; Public Works is eight huge tomes and the first of them, General And Construction Specifications, is 1358 pages long. They detail – in <em>excruciating</em> detail – not just how the roads you&rsquo;ll be driving on must be built, illuminated, made safe and maintained, but how those standards will be verified, audited and enforced.</p>
        
        <p>Cars and roads built to these standards don&rsquo;t so much enable freedom of motion and freedom from harm as they delimit in exacting detail on what roads, at what speeds and under what circumstances people must <em>be free from</em> the possibility of specific kinds of harm, where their motion must be free from the possibility of specific kinds of restriction or risk.</p>
        
        <p>The amount of comparable legislation around AI is, I believe, zero.</p>
        
        <p>Canada could building public trust in AI by defining, not just what confidence could mean, but what a positive defence of that confidence and reliability must look like. By defining not just what trustworthiness means, but what specific possibilities of specific harm that trustworthiness means you are free from the possibility of.</p>
        
        <p>That might help.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-skills-are-required-for-a-modern-digital-economy-and-how-can-canada-best-support-their-development-and-deployment-in-the-workforce">What skills are required for a modern, digital economy, and how can Canada best support their development and deployment in the workforce?</h2>
        
        <p>Respectfully, your real choices here are to either invest comprehensively in public education at the grade school, secondary and college/university/trades levels, or get some posters printed and pretend they&rsquo;ll accomplish anything.</p>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;d rather you invest comprehensively in public education.</p>
        
        <p>(Shoutout to <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@grimalkina" title="@grimalkina@mastodon.social">@grimalkina</a> on this one.)</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-can-canada-do-to-ensure-equitable-access-to-ai-literacy-across-regions-demographics-and-socioeconomic-groups">What can Canada do to ensure equitable access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups?</h2>
        
        <p>There&rsquo;s a famous metric in sociology about the effectiveness of social interventions in education called the &ldquo;hamburger metric&rdquo; – that is, if your social intervention can&rsquo;t be shown, decisively, to be more cost-effective at improving a child&rsquo;s academic outcomes than feeding them a hamburger, you should skip the intervention and feed them the hamburger.</p>
        
        <p>Canada can ensure equitable access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups by investing equally in access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups.</p>
        
        <p>Crazy, I know, but &ldquo;every student has a clean, warm classroom in a clean warm community with clean warm food, shelter and clean running water&rdquo; will do it.</p>
        
        <h2 id="which-infrastructure-gaps-compute-data-connectivity-are-holding-back-ai-innovation-in-canada-and-what-is-stopping-canadian-firms-from-building-sovereign-infrastructure-to-address-them">Which infrastructure gaps (compute, data, connectivity) are holding back AI innovation in Canada, and what is stopping Canadian firms from building sovereign infrastructure to address them?</h2>
        
        <p>Let&rsquo;s be real here, you&rsquo;re not actually going to do anything about this country&rsquo;s insane telco trigopoly.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-can-we-ensure-equitable-access-to-ai-infrastructure-across-regions-sectors-and-users-researchers-start-ups-smes">How can we ensure equitable access to AI infrastructure across regions, sectors and users (researchers, start-ups, SMEs)?</h2>
        
        <p>Another thing we can be real about is this: Canada already has two pieces of parallel infrastructure in place that provides equitable access to information across regions, sectors and users, available to every facet and lost geographic corner of Canadian society. They&rsquo;re the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Canada Post.</p>
        
        <p>The hardware is cheap and you can put it anywhere, so put it where we have places that already host hardware. Payment and delivery systems can be anywhere, and we&rsquo;ve already got them everywhere. If you want equitable access to technology infrastructure and information, so people can start businesses that leverage AI tools from anywhere to anywhere, across Canada then start by leveraging our existing nationwide infrastructure, as a country, to do exactly that:</p>
        
        <p>The CBC should grow to become a citizens&rsquo; web hosting service and Canada Post should become a bank.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-can-canada-strengthen-cybersecurity-and-safeguard-critical-infrastructure-data-and-models-in-the-age-of-ai">How can Canada strengthen cybersecurity and safeguard critical infrastructure, data and models in the age of AI?</h2>
        
        <p>Cybersecurity has approximately nothing to do with AI.</p>
        
        <p>If breach insurance companies declared today that your insurance was void if your software wasn&rsquo;t kept up to date, around 90% of cybersecurity breaches would end tomorrow. If they said your insurance was null and void if you didn&rsquo;t parameterize your SQL, injection attacks would end tomorrow.</p>
        
        <p>The recent Joint Cybersecurity Advisory from basically every intelligence agency in the Western world that came out last month warning about pervasive Chinese attacks and their success in achieving persistent access, had nothing at all to do with AI. If you go down the list of vulnerabilities being exploited there&rsquo;s nothing exotic or even interesting in it. Nothing, no zero days, no supply interdiction, no AI, no magic future technology from our ephemeral robot overloads, it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;companies did not patch well-known CVEs on time&rdquo;, and those CVEs are all &ldquo;programmer did not sanitise their inputs.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>This industry – and this country, and this world - are nowhere near the point where exotic knowledge or tools or magic are required to make huge progress on the cybersecurity front. This industry doesn&rsquo;t need MRI machines or mRNA vaccines or even penicillin. We need people to wash their hands. Let&rsquo;s start with that. Maybe if we&rsquo;re lucky we can even get people to wash their hands with soap. But that&rsquo;s where we are. People need to wash their damn hands.</p>

      <source:markdown># 2025-10-20 AI Canada

I’m reposting [@mhoye](https://mastodon.social/@mhoye &#34;@mhoye@mastodon.social&#34;)’s brilliant answers to [a consultation](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/public-consultations/help-define-next-chapter-canadas-ai-leadership) on Canada’s “AI leadership”. ( [Source](https://mastodon.social/@mhoye/115389752400985454))

The answers apply to all countries, needless to say.

## What efforts are needed to attract, develop and retain top AI talent across research, industry and the public sector?

Universal basic income. Excellent health care. Well-funded, accessible universities. Affordable housing. Clean, safe streets achieved by housing the homeless and sheltering and treating the addicted and mentally ill instead of punishing them. Thriving artistic communities in welcoming, multicultural cities. Progressive pricing for the fundamental necessities of life, like energy and shelter.

Any computer can be operated remotely, over any distance, from any other computer. I’m doing that right now by filling out this form. You’re doing it right now by reading what I’ve typed. Where the hardware is plugged in doesn’t matter at all. If we want to foster and retain talented researchers, practitioners and public administrators in Canada, then we need to build communities where young people starting their careers can afford to live, where people growing their careers want to live, and where people in the prime of their careers are happy to live.

## What are the key barriers to AI adoption, and how can government and industry work together to accelerate responsible uptake?

Right now the key barrier to AI adoption is that the people pushing it the hardest are absolutely the least trustworthy people on the planet, with a small army of epistemologically-adrift FOMO-addled C-levels rolling up fast behind them, and it’s being pushed into products and people’s working processes with no regard to utility or productivity at all. Right now, the overarching purpose of large-model AI is not “improved productivity” or “reduced error rates”, it is consuming enough computing resources, through whatever means necessary, that demand for computing stays high enough that the sector can keep their historic high-double-digit growth and returns going, and avoid turning into a commodified utility. But real-world uptake in most of these nonviable scenarios is close to zero and compute as a commodified uitility is where this is going.

Accelerating _responsible_ uptake means a measured approach, using consentfully obtained and carefully curated data to accomplish empirically sound and morally justifiable goals without freeing any person or organization using them from accountability for their actions. This means legal and regulatory frameworks with spine and teeth that understand what safe and consentful mean and impose meaningful costs for failing to meet those standards, and it means investing in historically-undervalued areas like criticism, curation and library sciences as foundational skillsets.

When people depend on their tools – not just use but depend – then the liability avoidance that is absolutely endemic in computing is completely unacceptable. Car companies are simply not permitted to say, if it breaks you can keep both pieces. And it is _the imposition of liability_ that has driven almost all of the modern innovations in automotive quality and safety. AI, and tech in general, needs those constrains in order to thrive.

## What needs to be put in place so Canada can grow globally competitive AI companies while retaining ownership, IP and economic sovereignty?

Again, I am begging you to understand two things: that any computer anywhere in the world can be operated remotely from any other computer anywhere in the world, and that landlords are a dead weight loss to society.

If you want to foster Canadian innovation and champion Canadian companies, any approach to this that involves business incentives and lets the rentier class thrive is – inevitably, mathematically – a race to the bottom.

If you want a new Renaissance, you have to build the new Vienna.

If you want innovative new technologies to exist, you _need_ to create communities where it is safe to fail. You need to create a society where the opportunity to, the ability to, and the tools to experiment are not the sole domain of already comfortable and already privileged. We know what those experiments look like already, they look like Mark Zuckerberg spending eighty billion dollars on the Metaverse and another eighty billion dollars on pretend chatbot friends and it doesn’t matter at all and nobody cares.

If you want to be the place that people go to build the future, you have to bet on people and build a place they’ll believe is worth living in while they try to build that future.

Invest in the arts, invest in the culture, invest in affordable housing and health care and tax the rentier class to fund those investments.

## How can Canada better connect AI research with commercialization to meet strategic business needs?

This is a waste of time and effort.

“Strategic business needs” are near-term problems whose contours and desired outcomes are known, where the remaining questions are about effective execution. Research is a long-term exploration whose results are always uncertain, but that sometimes pay off in wholly unexpected ways, even creating wholly unexpected markets.

When the microwave was invented, not only was there no market for microwaves, but every single kitchen in the world already had a way to heat up water in it. It would have been the easiest thing in the world to say, what’s the point of that, get back to work on stuff that matters.

Focusing on the commercialization of research is the absolute latest part of the process. If you want real innovation, fund speculation. When something interesting comes of it, you’ll get the commercialization for free in a few years.

## What lessons can we learn from countries that are successful at investment attraction in AI and tech, both from domestic sources and from foreign capital?

Nothing.

Right now, we can nothing from countries that are funding their own democratic, economic and ecological destruction by spending billion on circular investments into bubble markets without a real customer in sight, weaponizing automation against their working and minority classes and building vast data warehouses that will demand more electricity and water than their entire regions have available while driving the citizen’s cost of both through the roof.

We can learn nothing from them except how not to approach it and what not to do.

## How can Canada build public trust in AI technologies while addressing the risks they present? What are the most important things to do to build confidence?

Consentfully obtained, accountably auditable training data, transparent (and open source) training techniques, and most importantly: liability.

Most of our debates about freedom and safety are framed in terms of “freedom to”, and the arguments are about the limitations on those freedoms. If you’re luckier than me, those conversations might even involve “freedom from”.

But what if we lived in a society where that wasn’t enough? Where government had a positive obligation to not just permit freedom to, but defend the possibility of? To mandate and enforce standards saying you must be free from the possibility of specific kinds of failure?

We already have that for cars, of course.

The full text of CRC c.1038, the Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations section of the Consolidated Regulations of Canada, runs a full megabyte of text. The Ontario Provincial Standards for Roads &#38; Public Works is eight huge tomes and the first of them, General And Construction Specifications, is 1358 pages long. They detail – in _excruciating_ detail – not just how the roads you’ll be driving on must be built, illuminated, made safe and maintained, but how those standards will be verified, audited and enforced.

Cars and roads built to these standards don’t so much enable freedom of motion and freedom from harm as they delimit in exacting detail on what roads, at what speeds and under what circumstances people must _be free from_ the possibility of specific kinds of harm, where their motion must be free from the possibility of specific kinds of restriction or risk.

The amount of comparable legislation around AI is, I believe, zero.

Canada could building public trust in AI by defining, not just what confidence could mean, but what a positive defence of that confidence and reliability must look like. By defining not just what trustworthiness means, but what specific possibilities of specific harm that trustworthiness means you are free from the possibility of.

That might help.

## What skills are required for a modern, digital economy, and how can Canada best support their development and deployment in the workforce?

Respectfully, your real choices here are to either invest comprehensively in public education at the grade school, secondary and college/university/trades levels, or get some posters printed and pretend they’ll accomplish anything.

I’d rather you invest comprehensively in public education.

(Shoutout to [@grimalkina](https://mastodon.social/@grimalkina &#34;@grimalkina@mastodon.social&#34;) on this one.)

## What can Canada do to ensure equitable access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups?

There’s a famous metric in sociology about the effectiveness of social interventions in education called the “hamburger metric” – that is, if your social intervention can’t be shown, decisively, to be more cost-effective at improving a child’s academic outcomes than feeding them a hamburger, you should skip the intervention and feed them the hamburger.

Canada can ensure equitable access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups by investing equally in access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups.

Crazy, I know, but “every student has a clean, warm classroom in a clean warm community with clean warm food, shelter and clean running water” will do it.

## Which infrastructure gaps (compute, data, connectivity) are holding back AI innovation in Canada, and what is stopping Canadian firms from building sovereign infrastructure to address them?

Let’s be real here, you’re not actually going to do anything about this country’s insane telco trigopoly.

## How can we ensure equitable access to AI infrastructure across regions, sectors and users (researchers, start-ups, SMEs)?

Another thing we can be real about is this: Canada already has two pieces of parallel infrastructure in place that provides equitable access to information across regions, sectors and users, available to every facet and lost geographic corner of Canadian society. They’re the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Canada Post.

The hardware is cheap and you can put it anywhere, so put it where we have places that already host hardware. Payment and delivery systems can be anywhere, and we’ve already got them everywhere. If you want equitable access to technology infrastructure and information, so people can start businesses that leverage AI tools from anywhere to anywhere, across Canada then start by leveraging our existing nationwide infrastructure, as a country, to do exactly that:

The CBC should grow to become a citizens’ web hosting service and Canada Post should become a bank.

## How can Canada strengthen cybersecurity and safeguard critical infrastructure, data and models in the age of AI?

Cybersecurity has approximately nothing to do with AI.

If breach insurance companies declared today that your insurance was void if your software wasn’t kept up to date, around 90% of cybersecurity breaches would end tomorrow. If they said your insurance was null and void if you didn’t parameterize your SQL, injection attacks would end tomorrow.

The recent Joint Cybersecurity Advisory from basically every intelligence agency in the Western world that came out last month warning about pervasive Chinese attacks and their success in achieving persistent access, had nothing at all to do with AI. If you go down the list of vulnerabilities being exploited there’s nothing exotic or even interesting in it. Nothing, no zero days, no supply interdiction, no AI, no magic future technology from our ephemeral robot overloads, it’s all “companies did not patch well-known CVEs on time”, and those CVEs are all “programmer did not sanitise their inputs.”

This industry – and this country, and this world - are nowhere near the point where exotic knowledge or tools or magic are required to make huge progress on the cybersecurity front. This industry doesn’t need MRI machines or mRNA vaccines or even penicillin. We need people to wash their hands. Let’s start with that. Maybe if we’re lucky we can even get people to wash their hands with soap. But that’s where we are. People need to wash their damn hands.

      <title>Claude Code for web - a new asynchronous coding agent from Anthropic</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Anthropic launched Claude Code for web this morning. It's an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/async-coding-agents/">asynchronous coding agent</a> - their answer to OpenAI's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/16/openai-codex/">Codex Cloud</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/19/jules/">Google's Jules</a>, and has a very similar shape. I had preview access over the weekend and I've already seen some very promising results from it.</p>
        <p>It's available online at <a href="https://claude.ai">claude.ai/code</a> and shows up as a tab in the Claude iPhone app as well:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-for-web.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Claude AI interface showing a conversation about updating a README file. The left sidebar shows &quot;Claude&quot; at the top, followed by navigation items: &quot;Chats&quot;, &quot;Projects&quot;, &quot;Artifacts&quot;, and &quot;Code&quot; (highlighted). Below that is &quot;Starred&quot; section listing several items with trash icons: &quot;LLM&quot;, &quot;Python app&quot;, &quot;Check my post&quot;, &quot;Artifacts&quot;, &quot;Summarize&quot;, and &quot;Alt text writer&quot;. The center panel shows a conversation list with items like &quot;In progress&quot;, &quot;Run System C&quot;, &quot;Idle&quot;, &quot;Update Rese&quot;, &quot;Run Matplotl&quot;, &quot;Run Marketin&quot;, &quot;WebAssembl&quot;, &quot;Benchmark M&quot;, &quot;Build URL Qu&quot;, and &quot;Add Read-Or&quot;. The right panel displays the active conversation titled &quot;Update Research Project README&quot; showing a task to update a GitHub README file at https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/README.md, followed by Claude's response and command outputs showing file listings with timestamps from Oct 20 17:53." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>As far as I can tell it's their latest <a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code CLI</a> app wrapped in a container (Anthropic are getting <em>really</em> <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/">good at containers</a> these days) and configured to <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code>. It appears to behave exactly the same as the CLI tool, and includes a neat "teleport" feature which can copy both the chat transcript and the edited files down to your local Claude Code CLI tool if you want to take over locally.</p>
        <p>It's very straight-forward to use. You point Claude Code for web at a GitHub repository, select an environment (fully locked down, restricted to an allow-list of domains or configured to access domains of your choosing, including "*" for everything) and kick it off with a prompt.</p>
        <p>While it's running you can send it additional prompts which are queued up and executed after it completes its current step.</p>
        <p>Once it's done it opens a branch on your repo with its work and can optionally open a pull request.</p>
        <h4 id="putting-claude-code-for-web-to-work">Putting Claude Code for web to work</h4>
        <p>Claude Code for web's PRs are indistinguishable from Claude Code CLI's, so Anthropic told me it was OK to submit those against public repos even during the private preview. Here are some examples from this weekend:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/73">Add query-string-stripper.html tool</a> against my simonw/tools repo - a <em>very</em> simple task that creates (and deployed via GitHub Pages) this <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/query-string-stripper">query-string-stripper</a> tool.</li>
        <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/minijinja-vs-jinja2">minijinja vs jinja2 Performance Benchmark</a> - I ran this against a private repo and then copied the results here, so no PR. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/minijinja-vs-jinja2/README.md#the-prompt">the prompt</a> I used.</li>
        <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/1">Update deepseek-ocr README to reflect successful project completion</a> - I noticed that the README produced by Claude Code CLI for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/">this project</a> was misleadingly out of date, so I had Claude Code for web fix the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That second example is the most interesting. I saw <a href="https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1980034078297514319">a tweet from Armin</a> about his <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja">MiniJinja</a> Rust template language <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/pull/841">adding support</a> for Python 3.14 free threading. I hadn't realized that project <em>had</em> Python bindings, so I decided it would be interesting to see a quick performance comparison between MiniJinja and Jinja2.</p>
        <p>I ran Claude Code for web against a private repository with a completely open environment (<code>*</code> in the allow-list) and prompted:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I’m interested in benchmarking the Python bindings for <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja">https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja</a> against the equivalente template using Python jinja2</p>
        <p>Design and implement a benchmark for this. It should use the latest main checkout of minijinja and the latest stable release of jinja2. The benchmark should use the uv version of Python 3.14 and should test both the regular 3.14 and the 3.14t free threaded version - so four scenarios total</p>
        <p>The benchmark should run against a reasonably complicated example of a template, using template inheritance and loops and such like In the PR include a shell script to run the entire benchmark, plus benchmark implantation, plus markdown file describing the benchmark and the results in detail, plus some illustrative charts created using matplotlib</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I entered this into the Claude iPhone app on my mobile keyboard, hence the typos.</p>
        <p>It churned away for a few minutes and gave me exactly what I asked for. Here's one of the <a href="">four charts</a> it created:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/minijinja-timeline.jpg" alt="Line chart titled &quot;Rendering Time Across Iterations&quot; showing rendering time in milliseconds (y-axis, ranging from approximately 1.0 to 2.5 ms) versus iteration number (x-axis, ranging from 0 to 200+). Four different lines represent different versions: minijinja (3.14t) shown as a solid blue line, jinja2 (3.14) as a solid orange line, minijinja (3.14) as a solid green line, and jinja2 (3.14t) as a dashed red line. The green line (minijinja 3.14) shows consistently higher rendering times with several prominent spikes reaching 2.5ms around iterations 25, 75, and 150. The other three lines show more stable, lower rendering times between 1.0-1.5ms with occasional fluctuations." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>(I was surprised to see MiniJinja out-performed by Jinja2, but I guess Jinja2 has had a decade of clever performance optimizations and doesn't need to deal with any extra overhead of calling out to Rust.)</p>
        <p>Note that I would likely have got the <em>exact same</em> result running this prompt against Claude CLI on my laptop. The benefit of Claude Code for web is entirely in its convenience as a way of running these tasks in a hosted container managed by Anthropic, with a pleasant web and mobile UI layered over the top.</p>
        <h4 id="anthropic-are-framing-this-as-part-of-their-sandboxing-strategy">Anthropic are framing this as part of their sandboxing strategy</h4>
        <p>It's interesting how Anthropic chose to announce this new feature: the product launch is buried half way down their new engineering blog post <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-sandboxing">Beyond permission prompts: making Claude Code more secure and autonomous</a>, which starts like this:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Claude Code's new sandboxing features, a bash tool and Claude Code on the web, reduce permission prompts and increase user safety by enabling two boundaries: filesystem and network isolation.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I'm <em>very</em> excited to hear that Claude Code CLI is taking sandboxing more seriously. I've not yet dug into the details of that - it looks like it's using seatbelt on macOS and <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap">Bubblewrap</a> on Linux.</p>
        
        <p>Anthropic released a new open source (Apache 2) library, <a href="https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime">anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime</a>, with their implementation of this so far.</p>
        
        <p>Filesystem sandboxing is relatively easy. The harder problem is network isolation, which they describe like this:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Network isolation</strong>, by only allowing internet access through a unix domain socket connected to a proxy server running outside the sandbox. This proxy server enforces restrictions on the domains that a process can connect to, and handles user confirmation for newly requested domains. And if you’d like further-increased security, we also support customizing this proxy to enforce arbitrary rules on outgoing traffic.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is <em>crucial</em> to protecting against both prompt injection and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">lethal trifecta</a> attacks. The best way to prevent lethal trifecta attacks is to cut off one of the three legs, and network isolation is how you remove the data exfiltration leg that allows successful attackers to steal your data.</p>
        <p>If you run Claude Code for web in "No network access" mode you have nothing to worry about.</p>
        <p>I'm a little bit nervous about their "Trusted network access" environment. It's intended to only allow access to domains relating to dependency installation, but the <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude-code-on-the-web#default-allowed-domains">default domain list</a> has dozens of entries which makes me nervous about unintended exfiltration vectors sneaking through.</p>
        <p>You can also configure a custom environment with your own allow-list. I have one called "Everything" which allow-lists "*", because for projects like my MiniJinja/Jinja2 comparison above there are no secrets or source code involved that need protecting.</p>
        <p>I see Anthropic's focus on sandboxes as an acknowledgment that coding agents run in YOLO mode (<code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> and the like) are <em>enormously</em> more valuable and productive than agents where you have to approve their every step.</p>
        <p>The challenge is making it convenient and easy to run them safely. This kind of sandboxing kind is the only approach to safety that feels credible to me.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: A note on cost: I'm currently using a Claude "Max" plan that Anthropic gave me in order to test some of their features, so I don't have a good feeling for how Claude Code would cost for these kinds of projects.</p>
        
        <p>From running <code>npx ccusage@latest</code> (an <a href="https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage">unofficial cost estimate tool</a>) it looks like I'm using between $1 and $5 worth of daily Claude CLI invocations at the moment.</p>

As far as I can tell it&#39;s their latest [Claude Code CLI](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) app wrapped in a container (Anthropic are getting _really_ [good at containers](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/) these days) and configured to `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. It appears to behave exactly the same as the CLI tool, and includes a neat &#34;teleport&#34; feature which can copy both the chat transcript and the edited files down to your local Claude Code CLI tool if you want to take over locally.

It&#39;s very straight-forward to use. You point Claude Code for web at a GitHub repository, select an environment (fully locked down, restricted to an allow-list of domains or configured to access domains of your choosing, including &#34;\*&#34; for everything) and kick it off with a prompt.

While it&#39;s running you can send it additional prompts which are queued up and executed after it completes its current step.

Once it&#39;s done it opens a branch on your repo with its work and can optionally open a pull request.

#### Putting Claude Code for web to work

Claude Code for web&#39;s PRs are indistinguishable from Claude Code CLI&#39;s, so Anthropic told me it was OK to submit those against public repos even during the private preview. Here are some examples from this weekend:

- [Add query-string-stripper.html tool](https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/73) against my simonw/tools repo - a _very_ simple task that creates (and deployed via GitHub Pages) this [query-string-stripper](https://tools.simonwillison.net/query-string-stripper) tool.
- [minijinja vs jinja2 Performance Benchmark](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/minijinja-vs-jinja2) \- I ran this against a private repo and then copied the results here, so no PR. Here&#39;s [the prompt](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/minijinja-vs-jinja2/README.md#the-prompt) I used.
- [Update deepseek-ocr README to reflect successful project completion](https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/1) \- I noticed that the README produced by Claude Code CLI for [this project](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/) was misleadingly out of date, so I had Claude Code for web fix the problem.

That second example is the most interesting. I saw [a tweet from Armin](https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1980034078297514319) about his [MiniJinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja) Rust template language [adding support](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/pull/841) for Python 3.14 free threading. I hadn&#39;t realized that project _had_ Python bindings, so I decided it would be interesting to see a quick performance comparison between MiniJinja and Jinja2.

I ran Claude Code for web against a private repository with a completely open environment ( `*` in the allow-list) and prompted:

&#62; I’m interested in benchmarking the Python bindings for [https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja) against the equivalente template using Python jinja2
&#62;
&#62; Design and implement a benchmark for this. It should use the latest main checkout of minijinja and the latest stable release of jinja2. The benchmark should use the uv version of Python 3.14 and should test both the regular 3.14 and the 3.14t free threaded version - so four scenarios total
&#62;
&#62; The benchmark should run against a reasonably complicated example of a template, using template inheritance and loops and such like In the PR include a shell script to run the entire benchmark, plus benchmark implantation, plus markdown file describing the benchmark and the results in detail, plus some illustrative charts created using matplotlib

I entered this into the Claude iPhone app on my mobile keyboard, hence the typos.

It churned away for a few minutes and gave me exactly what I asked for. Here&#39;s one of the four charts it created:

![Line chart titled &#34;Rendering Time Across Iterations&#34; showing rendering time in milliseconds (y-axis, ranging from approximately 1.0 to 2.5 ms) versus iteration number (x-axis, ranging from 0 to 200+). Four different lines represent different versions: minijinja (3.14t) shown as a solid blue line, jinja2 (3.14) as a solid orange line, minijinja (3.14) as a solid green line, and jinja2 (3.14t) as a dashed red line. The green line (minijinja 3.14) shows consistently higher rendering times with several prominent spikes reaching 2.5ms around iterations 25, 75, and 150. The other three lines show more stable, lower rendering times between 1.0-1.5ms with occasional fluctuations.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/minijinja-timeline.jpg)

(I was surprised to see MiniJinja out-performed by Jinja2, but I guess Jinja2 has had a decade of clever performance optimizations and doesn&#39;t need to deal with any extra overhead of calling out to Rust.)

Note that I would likely have got the _exact same_ result running this prompt against Claude CLI on my laptop. The benefit of Claude Code for web is entirely in its convenience as a way of running these tasks in a hosted container managed by Anthropic, with a pleasant web and mobile UI layered over the top.

#### Anthropic are framing this as part of their sandboxing strategy

It&#39;s interesting how Anthropic chose to announce this new feature: the product launch is buried half way down their new engineering blog post [Beyond permission prompts: making Claude Code more secure and autonomous](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-sandboxing), which starts like this:

&#62; Claude Code&#39;s new sandboxing features, a bash tool and Claude Code on the web, reduce permission prompts and increase user safety by enabling two boundaries: filesystem and network isolation.

I&#39;m _very_ excited to hear that Claude Code CLI is taking sandboxing more seriously. I&#39;ve not yet dug into the details of that - it looks like it&#39;s using seatbelt on macOS and [Bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) on Linux.

Anthropic released a new open source (Apache 2) library, [anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime), with their implementation of this so far.

Filesystem sandboxing is relatively easy. The harder problem is network isolation, which they describe like this:

&#62; **Network isolation**, by only allowing internet access through a unix domain socket connected to a proxy server running outside the sandbox. This proxy server enforces restrictions on the domains that a process can connect to, and handles user confirmation for newly requested domains. And if you’d like further-increased security, we also support customizing this proxy to enforce arbitrary rules on outgoing traffic.

This is _crucial_ to protecting against both prompt injection and [lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) attacks. The best way to prevent lethal trifecta attacks is to cut off one of the three legs, and network isolation is how you remove the data exfiltration leg that allows successful attackers to steal your data.

If you run Claude Code for web in &#34;No network access&#34; mode you have nothing to worry about.

I&#39;m a little bit nervous about their &#34;Trusted network access&#34; environment. It&#39;s intended to only allow access to domains relating to dependency installation, but the [default domain list](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude-code-on-the-web#default-allowed-domains) has dozens of entries which makes me nervous about unintended exfiltration vectors sneaking through.

You can also configure a custom environment with your own allow-list. I have one called &#34;Everything&#34; which allow-lists &#34;\*&#34;, because for projects like my MiniJinja/Jinja2 comparison above there are no secrets or source code involved that need protecting.

I see Anthropic&#39;s focus on sandboxes as an acknowledgment that coding agents run in YOLO mode ( `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and the like) are _enormously_ more valuable and productive than agents where you have to approve their every step.

The challenge is making it convenient and easy to run them safely. This kind of sandboxing kind is the only approach to safety that feels credible to me.

**Update**: A note on cost: I&#39;m currently using a Claude &#34;Max&#34; plan that Anthropic gave me in order to test some of their features, so I don&#39;t have a good feeling for how Claude Code would cost for these kinds of projects.

From running `npx ccusage@latest` (an [unofficial cost estimate tool](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage)) it looks like I&#39;m using between $1 and $5 worth of daily Claude CLI invocations at the moment.

      <title>Getting DeepSeek-OCR working on an NVIDIA Spark via brute force using Claude Code</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>DeepSeek released a new model yesterday: <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">DeepSeek-OCR</a>, a 6.6GB model fine-tuned specifically for OCR. They released it as model weights that run using PyTorch and CUDA. I got it running on the NVIDIA Spark by having Claude Code effectively brute force the challenge of getting it working on that particular hardware.</p>
        <p>This small project (40 minutes this morning, most of which was Claude Code churning away while I had breakfast and did some other things) ties together a bunch of different concepts I've been exploring recently. I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designed an agentic loop</a> for the problem, gave Claude full permissions inside a Docker sandbox, embraced the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/">parallel agents lifestyle</a> and reused my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/nvidia-dgx-spark/">notes on the NVIDIA Spark</a> from last week.</p>
        <p>I knew getting a PyTorch CUDA model running on the Spark was going to be a little frustrating, so I decided to outsource the entire process to Claude Code to see what would happen.</p>
        <p>TLDR: It worked. It took four prompts (one long, three very short) to have Claude Code figure out everything necessary to run the new DeepSeek model on the NVIDIA Spark, OCR a document for me and produce <em>copious</em> notes about the process.</p>
        <h4 id="the-setup">The setup</h4>
        <p>I connected to the Spark from my Mac via SSH and started a new Docker container there:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>docker run -it --gpus=all \
          -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro \
          nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04 \
          bash</pre></div>
        <p>Then I installed npm and used that to install Claude Code:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>apt-get update
        DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive TZ=Etc/UTC apt-get install -y npm
        npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code</pre></div>
        <p>Then started Claude Code, telling it that it's OK that it's running as <code>root</code> because it's in a sandbox:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>IS_SANDBOX=1 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</pre></div>
        <p>It provided me a URL to click on to authenticate with my Anthropic account.</p>
        <h4 id="the-initial-prompts">The initial prompts</h4>
        <p>I kicked things off with this prompt:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Create a folder deepseek-ocr and do everything else in that folder</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then I ran the following, providing links to both the GitHub repository and the Hugging Face model, providing a clue about NVIDIA ARM and giving it an image (<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg">this one</a>, see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/the-perils-of-vibe-coding/">previous post</a>) that I wanted it to run OCR on.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Your task is to get this working: <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR</a> - it uses Hugging Face Transformers and models from <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR</a> - you are running in a Docker container on an NVIDIA ARM device, first research your environment to check it will be possible to do this. Git clone both of those - you may need to enable LFS first. Make extensive notes as you go in a notes.md file which you should only ever append new notes to. At the end of this you should have scripts in the folder which can be run to both setup and then run the model against an example - use <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg">https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg</a> as the example image that you OCR. As a final step create a detailed README.md file explaining the project and what you learned and how to run your code.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Note how I also told it to "make extensive notes as you go in a notes.md file which you should only ever append new notes to" so I'd have some useful notes at the end.</p>
        <h4 id="the-follow-ups">The follow-ups</h4>
        <p>It churned away for 13 minutes, and made a sequence of discoveries about the platform and the model and the difficulties of running PyTorch on it.</p>
        <p>And then... <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-assistant--2025-10-20-154706">it gave up</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>The NVIDIA GB10 GPU has compute capability sm_121, which is too new for PyTorch 2.5.1</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>PyTorch 2.5.1 supports: sm_50, sm_80, sm_86, sm_89, sm_90, sm_90a</li>
        <li>GB10 requires: sm_121</li>
        <li>Error: <code>CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device</code>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, the model has hardcoded <code>.cuda()</code> calls, preventing CPU fallback without code modifications.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>So I gave it some encouragement:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Any other options that might help get CUDA working like using different versions of PyTorch that have available CUDA wheels for this platform? Have you checked to see what PyTorch versions already have these ARM CUDA wheels that would work here?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It ran this command to grep for all available PyTorch wheels on <code>download.pytorch.org</code> that match the ARM architecture:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>curl -s https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch/ <span class="pl-k">|</span> grep -o <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>torch-[0-9.]*.*aarch64.whl<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> sort -V <span class="pl-k">|</span> tail -20</pre></div>
        <p>... and that unblocked it.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Excellent! I can see that PyTorch 2.9.0 has ARM64 wheels for CUDA 12.8, 12.9, and <strong>CUDA 13.0</strong> (cu130)! This is exactly what we need!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It installed the wheels it found and reported:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Good news! PyTorch 2.9.0 can detect the GB10 GPU with CUDA capability 12.1 (sm_121), but it says the maximum supported is 12.0. However, it's just a warning now instead of a hard error! Let's try running inference: [...]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then kept on churning for a bit, ignoring warnings, and managed to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-user--2025-10-20-155056">run the model</a>! It loaded the image and ran this prompt:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;|grounding|&gt;OCR this image.
        </code></pre>
        <p>And got back output that started like this:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Maybe we need to use a different prompt. Looking at the README from DeepSeek-OCR, there are different prompts:</p>

        <h4 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h4>
        <p>My first prompt was at 15:31:07 (UTC). The final message from Claude Code came in at 16:10:03. That means it took less than 40 minutes start to finish, and I was only actively involved for about 5-10 minutes of that time. The rest of the time I was having breakfast and doing other things.</p>
        <p>Having tried and failed to get PyTorch stuff working in the past, I count this as a <em>huge</em> win. I'll be using this process a whole lot more in the future.</p>
        <p>How good were the actual results? There's honestly so much material in the resulting notes created by Claude that I haven't reviewed all of it. There may well be all sorts of errors in there, but it's indisputable that it managed to run the model and made notes on how it did that such that I'll be able to do the same thing in the future.</p>
        <p>I think the key factors in executing this project successfully were the following:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>I gave it exactly what it needed: a Docker environment in the target hardware, instructions on where to get what it needed (the code and the model) and a clear goal for it to pursue. This is a great example of the pattern I described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing agentic loops</a>.</li>
        <li>Running it in a Docker sandbox meant I could use <code>claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</code> and leave it running on its own. If I'd had to approve every command it wanted to run I would have got frustrated and quit the project after just a few minutes.</li>
        <li>I applied my own knowledge and experience when it got stuck. I was confident (based on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/nvidia-dgx-spark/#claude-code-for-everything">previous experiments</a> with the Spark) that a CUDA wheel for ARM64 existed that was likely to work, so when it gave up I prompted it to try again, leading to success.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Oh, and it looks like DeepSeek OCR is a pretty good model if you spend the time experimenting with different ways to run it.</p>
        <h4 id="bonus-using-vs-code-to-monitor-the-container">Bonus: Using VS Code to monitor the container</h4>
        <p>A small TIL from today: I had kicked off the job running in the Docker container via SSH to the Spark when I realized it would be neat if I could easily monitor the files it was creating while it was running.</p>
        <p>I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/68a0ebff-b586-4278-bd91-6b715a657d2b">asked Claude.ai</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I am running a Docker container on a remote machine, which I started over SSH</p>
        <p>How can I have my local VS Code on MacOS show me the filesystem in that docker container inside that remote machine, without restarting anything?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It gave me a set of steps that solved this exact problem:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Install the VS Code "Remote SSH" and "Dev Containers" extensions</li>
        <li>Use "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host" to connect to the remote machine (on my Tailscale network that's <code>spark@100.113.1.114</code>)</li>
        <li>In the window for that remote SSH session, run "Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container" - this shows a list of containers and you can select the one you want to attach to</li>
        <li>... and that's it! VS Code opens a new window providing full access to all of the files in that container. I opened up <code>notes.md</code> and watched it as Claude Code appended to it in real time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>At the end when I told Claude to create a zip file of the results I could select that in the VS Code file explorer and use the "Download" menu item to download it to my Mac.</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>DeepSeek released a new model yesterday: [DeepSeek-OCR](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR), a 6.6GB model fine-tuned specifically for OCR. They released it as model weights that run using PyTorch and CUDA. I got it running on the NVIDIA Spark by having Claude Code effectively brute force the challenge of getting it working on that particular hardware.

This small project (40 minutes this morning, most of which was Claude Code churning away while I had breakfast and did some other things) ties together a bunch of different concepts I&#39;ve been exploring recently. I [designed an agentic loop](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/) for the problem, gave Claude full permissions inside a Docker sandbox, embraced the [parallel agents lifestyle](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/) and reused my [notes on the NVIDIA Spark](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/nvidia-dgx-spark/) from last week.

I knew getting a PyTorch CUDA model running on the Spark was going to be a little frustrating, so I decided to outsource the entire process to Claude Code to see what would happen.

TLDR: It worked. It took four prompts (one long, three very short) to have Claude Code figure out everything necessary to run the new DeepSeek model on the NVIDIA Spark, OCR a document for me and produce _copious_ notes about the process.

#### The setup

I connected to the Spark from my Mac via SSH and started a new Docker container there:

```
docker run -it --gpus=all \
  -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04 \
  bash
```

Then I installed npm and used that to install Claude Code:

```
apt-get update
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive TZ=Etc/UTC apt-get install -y npm
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then started Claude Code, telling it that it&#39;s OK that it&#39;s running as `root` because it&#39;s in a sandbox:

```
IS_SANDBOX=1 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

It provided me a URL to click on to authenticate with my Anthropic account.

#### The initial prompts

I kicked things off with this prompt:

&#62; Create a folder deepseek-ocr and do everything else in that folder

Then I ran the following, providing links to both the GitHub repository and the Hugging Face model, providing a clue about NVIDIA ARM and giving it an image ( [this one](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg), see [previous post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/the-perils-of-vibe-coding/)) that I wanted it to run OCR on.

&#62; Your task is to get this working: [https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR) \- it uses Hugging Face Transformers and models from [https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR) \- you are running in a Docker container on an NVIDIA ARM device, first research your environment to check it will be possible to do this. Git clone both of those - you may need to enable LFS first. Make extensive notes as you go in a notes.md file which you should only ever append new notes to. At the end of this you should have scripts in the folder which can be run to both setup and then run the model against an example - use [https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg) as the example image that you OCR. As a final step create a detailed README.md file explaining the project and what you learned and how to run your code.

Note how I also told it to &#34;make extensive notes as you go in a notes.md file which you should only ever append new notes to&#34; so I&#39;d have some useful notes at the end.

#### The follow-ups

It churned away for 13 minutes, and made a sequence of discoveries about the platform and the model and the difficulties of running PyTorch on it.

And then... [it gave up](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-assistant--2025-10-20-154706):

&#62; **The NVIDIA GB10 GPU has compute capability sm\_121, which is too new for PyTorch 2.5.1**
&#62;
&#62; - PyTorch 2.5.1 supports: sm\_50, sm\_80, sm\_86, sm\_89, sm\_90, sm\_90a
&#62; - GB10 requires: sm\_121
&#62; - Error: `CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device`
&#62;
&#62; Additionally, the model has hardcoded `.cuda()` calls, preventing CPU fallback without code modifications.

So I gave it some encouragement:

&#62; Any other options that might help get CUDA working like using different versions of PyTorch that have available CUDA wheels for this platform? Have you checked to see what PyTorch versions already have these ARM CUDA wheels that would work here?

It ran this command to grep for all available PyTorch wheels on `download.pytorch.org` that match the ARM architecture:

```
curl -s https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch/ | grep -o &#39;torch-[0-9.]*.*aarch64.whl&#39; | sort -V | tail -20
```

... and that unblocked it.

&#62; Excellent! I can see that PyTorch 2.9.0 has ARM64 wheels for CUDA 12.8, 12.9, and **CUDA 13.0** (cu130)! This is exactly what we need!

It installed the wheels it found and reported:

&#62; Good news! PyTorch 2.9.0 can detect the GB10 GPU with CUDA capability 12.1 (sm\_121), but it says the maximum supported is 12.0. However, it&#39;s just a warning now instead of a hard error! Let&#39;s try running inference: \[...\]

Then kept on churning for a bit, ignoring warnings, and managed to [run the model](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-user--2025-10-20-155056)! It loaded the image and ran this prompt:

```
&#60;|grounding|&#62;OCR this image.

```

And got back output that started like this:

```

Claude declared victory and pointed me to the [output/result.mmd](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/output/result.mmd?short_path=f43da6a) file, which contained only whitespace. So OCR had worked but the result had failed to be written correctly to disk.

I [said](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-user--2025-10-20-155826):

&#62; That result.mmd file looks to be exclusively whitespace to me, try and get a better result there - the bounding box image was good though

Which caused Claude to [reconsider](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-assistant--2025-10-20-155900) the prompt it used:

&#62; Maybe we need to use a different prompt. Looking at the README from DeepSeek-OCR, there are different prompts:
&#62;
&#62; - `&#34;&#60;image&#62;\n&#60;|grounding|&#62;Convert the document to markdown.&#34;` \- for documents
&#62; - `&#34;&#60;image&#62;\n&#60;|grounding|&#62;OCR this image.&#34;` \- general OCR
&#62; - `&#34;&#60;image&#62;\nFree OCR.&#34;` \- without layouts
&#62;
&#62; The &#34;grounding&#34; mode seems to be focused on bounding boxes, which is why we got good bounding box results but the text output might be in a different format.
&#62;
&#62; Let me try running it again with a different prompt that&#39;s more focused on text extraction rather than grounding.

It tried all of the prompt variants, [made a note about them](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/notes.md#text-output-improvement-2025-10-20-1601) and created a file called [PROMPTS\_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/PROMPTS_GUIDE.md) with a bunch more details, including this comparison table:

My final prompt was this, to gather everything together into a zip file I could extract from the Docker container:

I added the contents of that zip file to my new [simonw/research](https://github.com/simonw/research) GitHub repo [in the deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark) folder.

Claude really likes writing notes! Here&#39;s the directory listing of that finished folder:

#### Takeaways

My first prompt was at 15:31:07 (UTC). The final message from Claude Code came in at 16:10:03. That means it took less than 40 minutes start to finish, and I was only actively involved for about 5-10 minutes of that time. The rest of the time I was having breakfast and doing other things.

Having tried and failed to get PyTorch stuff working in the past, I count this as a _huge_ win. I&#39;ll be using this process a whole lot more in the future.

How good were the actual results? There&#39;s honestly so much material in the resulting notes created by Claude that I haven&#39;t reviewed all of it. There may well be all sorts of errors in there, but it&#39;s indisputable that it managed to run the model and made notes on how it did that such that I&#39;ll be able to do the same thing in the future.

I think the key factors in executing this project successfully were the following:

1. I gave it exactly what it needed: a Docker environment in the target hardware, instructions on where to get what it needed (the code and the model) and a clear goal for it to pursue. This is a great example of the pattern I described in [designing agentic loops](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/).
2. Running it in a Docker sandbox meant I could use `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` and leave it running on its own. If I&#39;d had to approve every command it wanted to run I would have got frustrated and quit the project after just a few minutes.
3. I applied my own knowledge and experience when it got stuck. I was confident (based on [previous experiments](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/nvidia-dgx-spark/#claude-code-for-everything) with the Spark) that a CUDA wheel for ARM64 existed that was likely to work, so when it gave up I prompted it to try again, leading to success.

Oh, and it looks like DeepSeek OCR is a pretty good model if you spend the time experimenting with different ways to run it.

#### Bonus: Using VS Code to monitor the container

A small TIL from today: I had kicked off the job running in the Docker container via SSH to the Spark when I realized it would be neat if I could easily monitor the files it was creating while it was running.

I [asked Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/share/68a0ebff-b586-4278-bd91-6b715a657d2b):

&#62; I am running a Docker container on a remote machine, which I started over SSH
&#62;
&#62; How can I have my local VS Code on MacOS show me the filesystem in that docker container inside that remote machine, without restarting anything?

It gave me a set of steps that solved this exact problem:

1. Install the VS Code &#34;Remote SSH&#34; and &#34;Dev Containers&#34; extensions
2. Use &#34;Remote-SSH: Connect to Host&#34; to connect to the remote machine (on my Tailscale network that&#39;s `spark@100.113.1.114`)
3. In the window for that remote SSH session, run &#34;Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container&#34; - this shows a list of containers and you can select the one you want to attach to
4. ... and that&#39;s it! VS Code opens a new window providing full access to all of the files in that container. I opened up `notes.md` and watched it as Claude Code appended to it in real time.

At the end when I told Claude to create a zip file of the results I could select that in the VS Code file explorer and use the &#34;Download&#34; menu item to download it to my Mac.

      <title>GSoC 2025: Usability Improvements for the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer</title>
      <link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-09-01-gsoc-ubsan-trap-messages/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>My name is Anthony and I had the pleasure of working on improving the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer this Google Summer of Code 2025. My mentors were Dan Liew and Michael Buch.</p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan) is a tool for detecting a subset of the undefined behaviors in the C, C++, and Objective-C languages at runtime. This project focused mainly on the trapping variant of UBSan, which is evoked through <code>-fsanitize-trap=&lt;...&gt;</code> along with <code>-fsanitize=&lt;...&gt;</code>. Trapping UBSan is a lighter-weight version of UBSan because upon detection of undefined behavior a trap instruction is executed rather than calling into a runtime library to handle the undefined behavior. This makes it more appealing for kernel, embedded, and production hardening use cases. For cases of undefined behavior that can be detected by UBSan, check out the <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">official clang documentation</a>.</p><p>An issue with trapping UBSan prior to my work was that it was much harder to debug undefined behavior when it is detected when compared to the non-trapping mode. To illustrate this consider this C program that reads integers from the command line arguments and adds them.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;int add(int a, int b) { return a + b;}int main(int argc, const char** argv) { if (argc &lt; 3) return 1; int a = atoi(argv[1]); int b = atoi(argv[2]); int result = add(a, b); printf(&#34;Added %d + %d = %d\n&#34;, a, b, result); return 0;}</code></pre><p>If this program is compiled and executed using UBSan with its userspace runtime it provides helpful output diagnosing the problem and also allows execution to continue.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ bin/clang -fsanitize=undefined add.c -g -o add &amp;&amp; ./add 2147483647 1add.c:5:13: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 2147483647 + 1 cannot be represented in type &#39;int&#39;SUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior add.c:5:13 Added 2147483647 + 1 = -2147483648</code></pre><p>In contrast when using UBSan in trapping mode the program immediately terminates when undefined behavior is detected as shown below.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o add &amp;&amp; ./add 2147483647 1[1] 54357 trace trap ./add 2147483647 1</code></pre><p>This is the expected behavior of trapping mode but how should a developer debug what happened when a trap is hit? If we attach a debugger and run the example program this is the output LLDB shows.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ lldb ./add -- 2147483647 1 (lldb) target create &#34;./add&#34;(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args &#34;2147483647&#34; &#34;1&#34;(lldb) rProcess 17347 launched: &#39;add&#39; (arm64)Process 17347 stopped* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = EXC_BREAKPOINT (code=1, subcode=0x100003d3c) frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 2 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 3 4 int add(int a, int b) {-&gt; 5 return a + b; 6 } 7 8 int main(int argc, const char** argv) {(lldb) bt* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = EXC_BREAKPOINT (code=1, subcode=0x100003d3c) * frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 frame #1: 0x0000000100003eec add`main(argc=3, argv=0x000000016fdff110) at add.c:13:18 frame #2: 0x00000001842bab98 dyld`start + 6076(lldb) dis -padd`add:-&gt; 0x100003d3c &lt;+40&gt;: brk #0x5500 0x100003d40 &lt;+44&gt;: ldr w0, [sp, #0x4] 0x100003d44 &lt;+48&gt;: add sp, sp, #0x10 0x100003d48 &lt;+52&gt;: ret </code></pre><p>We can see that a <code>brk</code> instruction was hit while handling the <code>a + b</code> expression but there is no good explanation of what happened. <code>brk</code> is the trap instruction on arm64 but it is not particularly clear this has anything to do with UBSan. For this toy example we can speculate that integer overflow occurred because the program was built with trapping UBSan and the trap was hit while handling <code>a + b</code>. However, in real programs built with trapping UBSan and potentially other hardening mechanisms it is often far less obvious what happened.</p><p>For this particular example. The information that this is an integer overflow UBSan check is actually there but it is not very obvious. On x86_64 and arm64 the reason for trapping is actually <a href="https://maskray.me/blog/2023-01-29-all-about-undefined-behavior-sanitizer">encoded in the operand to the trap instruction</a>. In this case the <code>#0x5500</code> immediate to the brk instruction encodes that this is a UBSan trap for integer overflow. The UBSan immediate is encoded as <code>('U' &lt;&lt; 8) + SanitizerHandler</code> where <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/96195e7d44613e272475c90df187678036f21966/clang/lib/CodeGen/SanitizerHandler.h#L78"><code>SanitizerHandler</code> is the enum value from the <code>SanitizerHandler</code> enum inside Clang’s internals</a>.</p><p>As we can see the debugging experience with UBSan traps is not ideal and improving this was the primary goal of the GSoC project.</p><h2 id="human-readable-descriptions-of-ubsan-traps-in-lldb">Human readable descriptions of UBSan traps in LLDB</h2><p>The natural place to tackle the debugging experience was to look at debugger integration.</p><h3 id="let-the-debugger-handle-most-of-the-work">Let the debugger handle most of the work</h3><p>One approach to this would be to teach debuggers (e.g. LLDB) to decode the trap reason encoded in trap instructions in the debugger. However, this approach wasn’t taken for several reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Using the trap reason encoded in trap instructions only works for x86_64 and arm64. The approach that I used works for all targets where debug info is supported (many more).</p></li><li><p>Relying on decoding the trap reason encoded in the trap instruction creates a tight coupling between the compiler and the debugger because if the encoding ever changes:</p><ul><li><p>The debugger would need to be changed to adapt to the new encoding.</p></li><li><p>Older versions of the debugger would fail to work with binaries using the new encoding.</p></li><li><p>New versions of the debugger would fail to work with binaries using the old encoding.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>In contrast, encoding the trap reason as a string in the debug info is a much looser coupling because the compiler is free to change the trap reason without changes to the debugger.</p></li></ul><h3 id="encoding-the-trap-reason-in-the-debug-info">Encoding the trap reason in the debug info</h3><p>The approach I took is based on how <code>__builtin_verbose_trap</code> encodes its message into debug info [11] [12], a feature which was implemented in the past for <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-hardening-in-libc/73925">libc++ hardening</a>. The core idea is that the trap reason string gets encoded directly in the trap&rsquo;s debug information.</p><p>To accomplish this, we needed to find a place to &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; the string in the DWARF DIE tree. Using a <code>DW_TAG_subprogram</code> was deemed the most straightforward and space-efficient location. This means we create a synthetic <code>DISubprogram</code> which is not a real function in the compiled program; it exists only in the debug info as a container. While the string could have been placed elsewhere, for reasons outside the scope of this blog post, it resides on this fake function DIE, with the trap reason encoded in the <code>DW_TAG_subprogram</code>&rsquo;s name. For a deeper dive into this design decision, you can see <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967#issuecomment-3054319138">[15]</a>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at the LLVM IR of the previous example to see how this is implemented:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o - -o - -S -emit-llvm -fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons=basic; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind optnone ssp uwtable(sync)define i32 @add(i32 noundef %a, i32 noundef %b) #0 !dbg !17 !func_sanitize !22 {entry: %a.addr = alloca i32, align 4 %b.addr = alloca i32, align 4 store i32 %a, ptr %a.addr, align 4 #dbg_declare(ptr %a.addr, !23, !DIExpression(), !24) store i32 %b, ptr %b.addr, align 4 #dbg_declare(ptr %b.addr, !25, !DIExpression(), !26) %0 = load i32, ptr %a.addr, align 4, !dbg !27 %1 = load i32, ptr %b.addr, align 4, !dbg !28 %2 = call { i32, i1 } @llvm.sadd.with.overflow.i32(i32 %0, i32 %1), !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %3 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %2, 0, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %4 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %2, 1, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %5 = xor i1 %4, true, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 br i1 %5, label %cont, label %trap, !dbg !29, !prof !30, !nosanitize !21trap: ; preds = %entry call void @llvm.ubsantrap(i8 0) #4, !dbg !31, !nosanitize !21 unreachable, !dbg !31, !nosanitize !21cont: ; preds = %entry ret i32 %3, !dbg !34};...!29 = !DILocation(line: 5, column: 13, scope: !17)!30 = !{!&#34;branch_weights&#34;, i32 1048575, i32 1}!31 = !DILocation(line: 0, scope: !32, inlinedAt: !29)!32 = distinct !DISubprogram(name: &#34;__clang_trap_msg$Undefined Behavior Sanitizer$Integer addition overflowed&#34;, scope: !2, file: !2, type: !33, flags: DIFlagArtificial, spFlags: DISPFlagDefinition, unit: !14)</code></pre><p>The debug metadata for the <code>@llvm.ubsantrap</code> call is <code>!31</code>. That <code>DILocation</code> has the scope of the <code>DISubprogram</code> assigned to <code>!32</code> which is the artificial function which encodes the trap category. This function&rsquo;s name is formatted as <code>__clang_trap_msg$&lt;Category&gt;$&lt;TrapMessage&gt;</code> to encode the trap category (<code>Undefined Behavior Sanitizer</code>) and the specific message (<code>Integer addition overflowed</code>). This function does not actually exist in the compiled program. It only exists in the debug info as a convenient way to describe the reason for trapping. When a trap is hit in the debugger, the debugger retrieves this string from the debug info and shows it as the reason for trapping.</p><p>Note that the <code>DILocation</code> for <code>!31</code> has <code>inlinedAt:</code> which tells us that the trap was inlined from <code>!32</code> into the location at <code>!29</code> which is the location of the <code>a + b</code> expression in the <code>add</code> function.</p><p>I implemented this change on this <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967">PR</a>.</p><h3 id="debug-info-size-changes">Debug info size changes</h3><p>One concern that a reviewer had was the debug info size difference. This was one of the motivations for putting this feature under the new <code>-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code> flag because initially (prior to code review), my mentors and I planned to have the trap feature flag accompany the <code>-fsanitize-trap=</code> flag. Although the <code>-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code> flag is on by default (so long as trapping UBSan is enabled), having the trap reason feature under a flag allows users to opt-out by using the <code>-fno-sanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code> flag.</p><p>Using bloaty, I tested a release build of clang with the <code>-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code> flag enabled, and one with it disabled (<code>-fno-sanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code>). We found that the size difference was negligible; results are below.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code> FILE SIZE VM SIZE -------------- -------------- +0.3% +6.01Mi +0.3% +6.01Mi ,__debug_info +2.0% +2.26Mi [ = ] 0 [Unmapped] +1.2% +1.35Mi +1.2% +1.35Mi ,__apple_names +0.0% +1.01Mi +0.0% +1.01Mi ,__debug_str +0.8% +636Ki +0.8% +635Ki ,__debug_line +0.4% +161Ki +0.4% +161Ki ,__debug_ranges +0.4% +47.9Ki +0.4% +47.9Ki ,__debug_abbrev +0.0% +14 +0.0% +14 ,__apple_types [ = ] 0 +0.0% +8 ,__common [ = ] 0 +7.1% +4 ,__thread_bss -0.0% -4 -0.0% -4 ,__const -0.0% -1.27Ki -0.0% -1.27Ki ,__cstring +0.2% +11.5Mi +0.1% +9.19Mi TOTAL</code></pre><p>Note it is likely the code size difference is negligible because because in optimized builds trap instructions in a function get merged together which causes the additional debug info my patch adds to be dropped.</p><p>Realistically this will add a few more abbreviations into .debug_abbrev (the DWARF abbreviation section) and only a few extra bytes per-UBSAN trap (abbreviation code + 1 ULEB128 for the index into the string offset table) into .debug_info (the DWARF debug-info section).

      <source:markdown>## Introduction

My name is Anthony and I had the pleasure of working on improving the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer this Google Summer of Code 2025. My mentors were Dan Liew and Michael Buch.

## Background

Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan) is a tool for detecting a subset of the undefined behaviors in the C, C++, and Objective-C languages at runtime. This project focused mainly on the trapping variant of UBSan, which is evoked through `-fsanitize-trap=&#60;...&#62;` along with `-fsanitize=&#60;...&#62;`. Trapping UBSan is a lighter-weight version of UBSan because upon detection of undefined behavior a trap instruction is executed rather than calling into a runtime library to handle the undefined behavior. This makes it more appealing for kernel, embedded, and production hardening use cases. For cases of undefined behavior that can be detected by UBSan, check out the [official clang documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html).

An issue with trapping UBSan prior to my work was that it was much harder to debug undefined behavior when it is detected when compared to the non-trapping mode. To illustrate this consider this C program that reads integers from the command line arguments and adds them.

```
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;int add(int a, int b) { return a + b;}int main(int argc, const char** argv) { if (argc &#60; 3) return 1; int a = atoi(argv[1]); int b = atoi(argv[2]); int result = add(a, b); printf(&#34;Added %d + %d = %d\n&#34;, a, b, result); return 0;}
```

If this program is compiled and executed using UBSan with its userspace runtime it provides helpful output diagnosing the problem and also allows execution to continue.

```
$ bin/clang -fsanitize=undefined add.c -g -o add &#38;&#38; ./add 2147483647 1add.c:5:13: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 2147483647 + 1 cannot be represented in type &#39;int&#39;SUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior add.c:5:13 Added 2147483647 + 1 = -2147483648
```

In contrast when using UBSan in trapping mode the program immediately terminates when undefined behavior is detected as shown below.

```
$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o add &#38;&#38; ./add 2147483647 1[1] 54357 trace trap ./add 2147483647 1
```

This is the expected behavior of trapping mode but how should a developer debug what happened when a trap is hit? If we attach a debugger and run the example program this is the output LLDB shows.

```
$ lldb ./add -- 2147483647 1 (lldb) target create &#34;./add&#34;(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args &#34;2147483647&#34; &#34;1&#34;(lldb) rProcess 17347 launched: &#39;add&#39; (arm64)Process 17347 stopped* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = EXC_BREAKPOINT (code=1, subcode=0x100003d3c) frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 2 #include &#60;stdio.h&#62; 3 4 int add(int a, int b) {-&#62; 5 return a + b; 6 } 7 8 int main(int argc, const char** argv) {(lldb) bt* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = EXC_BREAKPOINT (code=1, subcode=0x100003d3c) * frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 frame #1: 0x0000000100003eec add`main(argc=3, argv=0x000000016fdff110) at add.c:13:18 frame #2: 0x00000001842bab98 dyld`start + 6076(lldb) dis -padd`add:-&#62; 0x100003d3c &#60;+40&#62;: brk #0x5500 0x100003d40 &#60;+44&#62;: ldr w0, [sp, #0x4] 0x100003d44 &#60;+48&#62;: add sp, sp, #0x10 0x100003d48 &#60;+52&#62;: ret
```

We can see that a `brk` instruction was hit while handling the `a + b` expression but there is no good explanation of what happened. `brk` is the trap instruction on arm64 but it is not particularly clear this has anything to do with UBSan. For this toy example we can speculate that integer overflow occurred because the program was built with trapping UBSan and the trap was hit while handling `a + b`. However, in real programs built with trapping UBSan and potentially other hardening mechanisms it is often far less obvious what happened.

For this particular example. The information that this is an integer overflow UBSan check is actually there but it is not very obvious. On x86\_64 and arm64 the reason for trapping is actually [encoded in the operand to the trap instruction](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-01-29-all-about-undefined-behavior-sanitizer). In this case the `#0x5500` immediate to the brk instruction encodes that this is a UBSan trap for integer overflow. The UBSan immediate is encoded as `(&#39;U&#39; &#60;&#60; 8) + SanitizerHandler` where [`SanitizerHandler` is the enum value from the `SanitizerHandler` enum inside Clang’s internals](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/96195e7d44613e272475c90df187678036f21966/clang/lib/CodeGen/SanitizerHandler.h#L78).

As we can see the debugging experience with UBSan traps is not ideal and improving this was the primary goal of the GSoC project.

## Human readable descriptions of UBSan traps in LLDB

The natural place to tackle the debugging experience was to look at debugger integration.

### Let the debugger handle most of the work

One approach to this would be to teach debuggers (e.g. LLDB) to decode the trap reason encoded in trap instructions in the debugger. However, this approach wasn’t taken for several reasons:

- Using the trap reason encoded in trap instructions only works for x86\_64 and arm64. The approach that I used works for all targets where debug info is supported (many more).

- Relying on decoding the trap reason encoded in the trap instruction creates a tight coupling between the compiler and the debugger because if the encoding ever changes:

  - The debugger would need to be changed to adapt to the new encoding.

  - Older versions of the debugger would fail to work with binaries using the new encoding.

  - New versions of the debugger would fail to work with binaries using the old encoding.
- In contrast, encoding the trap reason as a string in the debug info is a much looser coupling because the compiler is free to change the trap reason without changes to the debugger.


### Encoding the trap reason in the debug info

The approach I took is based on how `__builtin_verbose_trap` encodes its message into debug info \[11\] \[12\], a feature which was implemented in the past for [libc++ hardening](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-hardening-in-libc/73925). The core idea is that the trap reason string gets encoded directly in the trap’s debug information.

To accomplish this, we needed to find a place to “stuff” the string in the DWARF DIE tree. Using a `DW_TAG_subprogram` was deemed the most straightforward and space-efficient location. This means we create a synthetic `DISubprogram` which is not a real function in the compiled program; it exists only in the debug info as a container. While the string could have been placed elsewhere, for reasons outside the scope of this blog post, it resides on this fake function DIE, with the trap reason encoded in the `DW_TAG_subprogram`’s name. For a deeper dive into this design decision, you can see [\[15\]](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967#issuecomment-3054319138).

Let’s look at the LLVM IR of the previous example to see how this is implemented:

```
$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o - -o - -S -emit-llvm -fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons=basic; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind optnone ssp uwtable(sync)define i32 @add(i32 noundef %a, i32 noundef %b) #0 !dbg !17 !func_sanitize !22 {entry: %a.addr = alloca i32, align 4 %b.addr = alloca i32, align 4 store i32 %a, ptr %a.addr, align 4 #dbg_declare(ptr %a.addr, !23, !DIExpression(), !24) store i32 %b, ptr %b.addr, align 4 #dbg_declare(ptr %b.addr, !25, !DIExpression(), !26) %0 = load i32, ptr %a.addr, align 4, !dbg !27 %1 = load i32, ptr %b.addr, align 4, !dbg !28 %2 = call { i32, i1 } @llvm.sadd.with.overflow.i32(i32 %0, i32 %1), !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %3 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %2, 0, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %4 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %2, 1, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %5 = xor i1 %4, true, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 br i1 %5, label %cont, label %trap, !dbg !29, !prof !30, !nosanitize !21trap: ; preds = %entry call void @llvm.ubsantrap(i8 0) #4, !dbg !31, !nosanitize !21 unreachable, !dbg !31, !nosanitize !21cont: ; preds = %entry ret i32 %3, !dbg !34};...!29 = !DILocation(line: 5, column: 13, scope: !17)!30 = !{!&#34;branch_weights&#34;, i32 1048575, i32 1}!31 = !DILocation(line: 0, scope: !32, inlinedAt: !29)!32 = distinct !DISubprogram(name: &#34;__clang_trap_msg$Undefined Behavior Sanitizer$Integer addition overflowed&#34;, scope: !2, file: !2, type: !33, flags: DIFlagArtificial, spFlags: DISPFlagDefinition, unit: !14)
```

The debug metadata for the `@llvm.ubsantrap` call is `!31`. That `DILocation` has the scope of the `DISubprogram` assigned to `!32` which is the artificial function which encodes the trap category. This function’s name is formatted as `__clang_trap_msg$&#60;Category&#62;$&#60;TrapMessage&#62;` to encode the trap category ( `Undefined Behavior Sanitizer`) and the specific message ( `Integer addition overflowed`). This function does not actually exist in the compiled program. It only exists in the debug info as a convenient way to describe the reason for trapping. When a trap is hit in the debugger, the debugger retrieves this string from the debug info and shows it as the reason for trapping.

Note that the `DILocation` for `!31` has `inlinedAt:` which tells us that the trap was inlined from `!32` into the location at `!29` which is the location of the `a + b` expression in the `add` function.

I implemented this change on this [PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967).

### Debug info size changes

One concern that a reviewer had was the debug info size difference. This was one of the motivations for putting this feature under the new `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` flag because initially (prior to code review), my mentors and I planned to have the trap feature flag accompany the `-fsanitize-trap=` flag. Although the `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` flag is on by default (so long as trapping UBSan is enabled), having the trap reason feature under a flag allows users to opt-out by using the `-fno-sanitize-debug-trap-reasons` flag.

Using bloaty, I tested a release build of clang with the `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` flag enabled, and one with it disabled ( `-fno-sanitize-debug-trap-reasons`). We found that the size difference was negligible; results are below.

```
 FILE SIZE VM SIZE -------------- -------------- +0.3% +6.01Mi +0.3% +6.01Mi ,__debug_info +2.0% +2.26Mi [ = ] 0 [Unmapped] +1.2% +1.35Mi +1.2% +1.35Mi ,__apple_names +0.0% +1.01Mi +0.0% +1.01Mi ,__debug_str +0.8% +636Ki +0.8% +635Ki ,__debug_line +0.4% +161Ki +0.4% +161Ki ,__debug_ranges +0.4% +47.9Ki +0.4% +47.9Ki ,__debug_abbrev +0.0% +14 +0.0% +14 ,__apple_types [ = ] 0 +0.0% +8 ,__common [ = ] 0 +7.1% +4 ,__thread_bss -0.0% -4 -0.0% -4 ,__const -0.0% -1.27Ki -0.0% -1.27Ki ,__cstring +0.2% +11.5Mi +0.1% +9.19Mi TOTAL
```

Note it is likely the code size difference is negligible because because in optimized builds trap instructions in a function get merged together which causes the additional debug info my patch adds to be dropped.

Realistically this will add a few more abbreviations into .debug\_abbrev (the DWARF abbreviation section) and only a few extra bytes per-UBSAN trap (abbreviation code + 1 ULEB128 for the index into the string offset table) into .debug\_info (the DWARF debug-info section). The rest of the DW\_TAG\_subprogram is encoded in the abbreviation for that fake frame [\[16\]](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967#issuecomment-3068862442). It would also be contingent on the number of traps emitted since a new `DW_TAG_subprogram` DIE is emitted for each trap with this new feature. [A later comparison on a larger code base (“Big Google Binary”)](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154618#issuecomment-3225724300), actually found a rather significant size increase of about 18% with trap reasons enabled. Future work may involve looking into why this is happening, and how such drastic size increases can be reduced.

### Displaying the trap reason in the debugger

With the support in the compiler for encoding the trap reasons for UBSan implemented I then turned my attention to displaying these in the LLDB debugger.

In this particular case nothing new needs to be implemented in LLDB because the `VerboseTrapFrameRecognizer` in LLDB which was implemented for `__builtin_verbose_trap` is general enough that it already supports any artificial function in the debug info of the form `__clang_trap_msg$&#60;Category&#62;$&#60;TrapMessage&#62;`.

So if we take the running example and run it under LLDB, its output now looks like.

```
$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o add$ lldb ./add -- 2147483647 1(lldb) target create &#34;add&#34;(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args &#34;2147483647&#34; &#34;1&#34;(lldb) rProcess 81705 launched: &#39;/add&#39; (arm64)Process 81705 stopped* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = Undefined Behavior Sanitizer: Integer addition overflowed frame #1: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 2 #include &#60;stdio.h&#62; 3 4 int add(int a, int b) {-&#62; 5 return a + b; 6 } 7 8 int main(int argc, const char** argv) {(lldb) bt* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = Undefined Behavior Sanitizer: Integer addition overflowed frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`__clang_trap_msg$Undefined Behavior Sanitizer$Integer addition overflowed at add.c:0 [inlined] * frame #1: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 frame #2: 0x0000000100003eec add`main(argc=3, argv=0x000000016fdff110) at add.c:13:18 frame #3: 0x00000001842bab98 dyld`start + 6076(lldb) dis -padd`__clang_trap_msg$Undefined Behavior Sanitizer$Integer addition overflowed:-&#62; 0x100003d3c &#60;+40&#62;: brk #0x5500 0x100003d40 &#60;+44&#62;: ldr w0, [sp, #0x4] 0x100003d44 &#60;+48&#62;: add sp, sp, #0x10 0x100003d48 &#60;+52&#62;: ret
```

Notice that:

The stop reason now shows as `Undefined Behavior Sanitizer: Integer addition overflowed`. Previously no helpful stop reason was shown.We are stopped with `frame #1` selected and the artificial frame ( `frame #0`) is present in the backtrace. LLDB does this so stopping is not shown in the artificial function which would be confusing.The `dis -pc` output claims we are inside the artificial function. This is an artifact of the implementation that is a little confusing but worth the trade-off.

So for this portion of my GSoC project the only thing I need to do was added a test case to ensure LLDB behaved appropriately. This was done on [this PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/151231).

## RFC: Add a warning when `-fsanitize=` is passed without associated `-fsanitize-trap=`

The next part of my GSoC project was to post an RFC and implement a sketch fix for a usability problem with trapping UBSan.

Currently, clang does not warn about cases where `-fsanitize-trap=` does nothing (silent no-op), particularly [in the case where `-fsanitize-trap=` is passed without `-fsanitize=`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html#id5):

Ex:

`$ clang -fsanitize-trap=undefined foo.c`

Emits no warning, even though `-fsanitize-trap=undefined` is not doing anything here.

We thought it would be more user-friendly to add a warning for such cases, but due to some [initial community pushback](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/clang-gsoc-2025-usability-improvements-for-trapping-undefined-behavior-sanitizer/84568/11), it was decided that an RFC should be opened. I ended up writing a [sketch patch that emitted a warning for such cases](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/147997).

Ex:

`$ clang -fsanitize-trap=undefined foo.c`

Would now emit:

`warning: -fsanitize-trap=undefined has no effect because the &#34;undefined&#34; sanitizer is disabled; consider passing &#34;-fsanitize=undefined&#34; to enable the sanitizer`

Unfortunately, we found that the emission of such warnings could become exceedingly complicated and a point of contention due to the existence of sanitizer groups, subgroups, and individual sanitizers. Determining the correct behavior for various cases, historical precedence with no-ops, interference with current build systems, prioritization of existing build systems over the user experience, and compatibility with gcc led to the end of [the RFC](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-emit-a-warning-when-fsanitize-trap-is-passed-without-associated-fsanitize/87893).

## Expand upon the hard-coded strings in `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` to be more specific

There were two initial design decisions to pick from here. Either I could:

**(a)** Use some string formatting, such as LLVM’s formatvariadic or raw\_ostream. For some implementation context, the function in which the trap messages were generated was called in a function called `EmitTrapCheck`, so the idea was to pass down extra information from earlier in the call stack before `EmitTrapCheck` was called.

or

**(b)** Extend clang’s diagnostic system to accomodate trap reasons. This is explained further below.

Due to the time it took to complete the first two tasks, I chose the first option. I deemed the second option to be a large commitment that I wouldn’t have been able to do by the end of the GSoC coding period. Additionally, I was unsure if building on top of the diagnostics subsystem would be approved since diagnostics were originally intended to emit messages within the command line, not debug info.

After taking some time to investigate possible cases where extra information in trap messages could be useful, I put up [a PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153845). The patch was admittedly quite messy, so to take a cleaner approach that was more aligned with clang’s frontend, one of my mentors, Dan, ended up following through with option (b) to [create the extension to the clang diagnostics subsystem to work with trap messages](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154618). By extending the diagnostics subsystem, it allows us to leverage the powerful string formatting engine of the diagnostics system.

However, this doesn’t mean that the effort used to write proper hard-coded trap messages under `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` was thrown away. Rather as of [Dan’s patch](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154618), the flag now has two options: `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons=basic` for the hard-coded trap messages and `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons=detailed` for the detailed trap messages which utilize the trap reasons diagnostics API. This was done in case users did not want to deal with the larger binary sizes that came with the trap reasons.

## What I’ve Learned

Before I started this GSoC, I barely even knew how to build clang and LLVM or use git in a large open-source project. My mentors showed me the ropes on a lot of things (particularly how to properly use git and build and configure clang), and I came out of this summer knowing a lot more of how to get my changes properly reviewed and upstreamed. I was also able to get a firmer understanding of the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer, better C++ programming practices, and the LLVM codebase.

## Work to Do

As stated prior, some research needs to be conducted to figure out how size increase can be minimalized.

Also stated previously, the diagnostics extension for trap messages has been [upstreamed by Dan](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154618). As of right now, only signed and unsigned overflow for addition, subtraction, and multiplication are being used by this system. I plan to integrate what I found on my [abandoned PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153845) by building on top of what Dan has already done. This will be done after the GSoC coding period.

There is [an issue](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/150707) where trap messages are not emitted in cases where they should be due to a null check. The purpose of the null check was to prevent a nullptr dereference that occurred in the debug-info prologue. This is a known issue to which there isn’t a concrete solution as of current.

## Conclusion

I want to give a special thanks to my mentors, Dan and Michael, for being there for me the whole way. They helped a lot with guiding me through git, the LLVM code base, and even this blog post. I appreciate their commitment to the project and their patience with me.

I’m incredibly grateful that I was able to work on this project and I wouldn’t have traded it for anything else. Being a beginner to both LLVM and open-source, I have to admit I was overwhelmed at first, but slowly, along with their help, I was able to gain at least a semblance of understanding of how things worked. I could not have asked for a better set of mentors, so again, a huge thanks to them. I want to also extend my gratitude to the LLVM Foundation for this opportunity.

I’ve had a lot of fun with this project and I hope to contribute more to LLVM, or in open-source in general, in the future.

      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/more-control-equals-less-performance/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I’ve been thinking about <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-07-18T0946" >a note</a> from Alex Russell where he says:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>any time you&#39;re running JS on the main thread, you&#39;re at risk of being left behind by progress.</p>
        <p>The zen of web development is to spend a little time in your own code, and instead to glue the big C++/Rust subsystems together, then <em>get out of the bloody way.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In his thread on Bluesky, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/infrequently.org/post/3lu7j6gwjf2cd" >Alex continues</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>How do we do this? Using the declarative systems that connect to those big piles of C++/Rust: CSS for the compositor (including scrolling &amp; animations), HTML parser to build DOM, and for various media, dishing off to the high-level systems in ways that don&#39;t call back into your JS.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I keep thinking about this difference:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I need to write code that does X.</li>
        <li>I need to write code that calls a browser API to do X.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There’s a big difference between A) making suggestions for the browser, and B) being its <a href="https://bell.bz/be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager/" >micromanager</a>.</p>
        <p>Hence the title: you can write code that will run in the browser, or you can write code that calls the browser to run.</p>
        <h2 id="a-few-examples">A Few Examples</h2>
        <p>So what are the browser ‘subsystems’ I can glue together? What are some examples of things I can ask the browser to do rather than doing them myself?</p>
        <p>A examples come to mind:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>View transitions API (instead of JS DOM diffing and manual animation).</li>
        <li>CSS transitions or <code>@keyframes</code> (GPU-accelerated) vs. manual JS with <code>setInterval</code> updates.</li>
        <li><code>scroll-behavior: smooth</code> in CSS vs. JS scroll logic.</li>
        <li>CSS grid or flexbox vs. JS layout engines (e.g., Masonry clones).</li>
        <li><code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> elements with native decoding and hardware acceleration vs. JS media players.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> with <code>srcset</code> for responsive images vs. manual image swapping logic in JS.</li>
        <li>Built-in form state (<code>formData</code>) and validation (<code>required</code>, <code>pattern</code>, etc.) vs. JS-based state, tracking, and validation logic.</li>
        <li>Native elements like <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, etc., which provide built-in keyboard and accessibility behavior vs. custom ARIA-heavy components.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="going-galaxy-brain">Going Galaxy Brain</h2>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/galaxy-brain-animation.jpg" width="500" height="702" alt="Galaxy brain meme from top to bottom: setTimeout -> requestAnimationFrame -> document.startViewTransition -> @view-transition" data-og-image />
        
        </p><p>The trick is to let go of your need for control. Say to yourself, “If I don’t micromanage the browser on this task and am willing to let go of control, in return it will choose how to do this itself with lower-level APIs that are more performant than anything I can write.”</p>
        <p>For example, here are some approaches to animating transitions on the web where each step moves more responsibility from your JavaScript code on the main thread to the browser’s rendering engine:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>setTimeout</code><ul>
        <li>JS timers, DOM manipulation, browser repaints when it can. Dropped frames.</li>
        </ul>

      <source:markdown>I’ve been thinking about [a note](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-07-18T0946) from Alex Russell where he says:

&#62; any time you&#39;re running JS on the main thread, you&#39;re at risk of being left behind by progress.
&#62;
&#62; The zen of web development is to spend a little time in your own code, and instead to glue the big C++/Rust subsystems together, then _get out of the bloody way._

In his thread on Bluesky, [Alex continues](https://bsky.app/profile/infrequently.org/post/3lu7j6gwjf2cd):

&#62; How do we do this? Using the declarative systems that connect to those big piles of C++/Rust: CSS for the compositor (including scrolling &#38; animations), HTML parser to build DOM, and for various media, dishing off to the high-level systems in ways that don&#39;t call back into your JS.

I keep thinking about this difference:

- I need to write code that does X.
- I need to write code that calls a browser API to do X.

There’s a big difference between A) making suggestions for the browser, and B) being its [micromanager](https://bell.bz/be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager/).

Hence the title: you can write code that will run in the browser, or you can write code that calls the browser to run.

## A Few Examples

So what are the browser ‘subsystems’ I can glue together? What are some examples of things I can ask the browser to do rather than doing them myself?

A examples come to mind:

- View transitions API (instead of JS DOM diffing and manual animation).
- CSS transitions or `@keyframes` (GPU-accelerated) vs. manual JS with `setInterval` updates.
- `scroll-behavior: smooth` in CSS vs. JS scroll logic.
- CSS grid or flexbox vs. JS layout engines (e.g., Masonry clones).
- `&#60;video&#62;` and `&#60;audio&#62;` elements with native decoding and hardware acceleration vs. JS media players.
- `&#60;picture&#62;` or `&#60;img&#62;` with `srcset` for responsive images vs. manual image swapping logic in JS.
- Built-in form state ( `formData`) and validation ( `required`, `pattern`, etc.) vs. JS-based state, tracking, and validation logic.
- Native elements like `&#60;details&#62;`, `&#60;dialog&#62;`, `&#60;select&#62;`, etc., which provide built-in keyboard and accessibility behavior vs. custom ARIA-heavy components.

## Going Galaxy Brain

![Galaxy brain meme from top to bottom: setTimeout -&#62; requestAnimationFrame -&#62; document.startViewTransition -&#62; @view-transition](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/galaxy-brain-animation.jpg)

The trick is to let go of your need for control. Say to yourself, “If I don’t micromanage the browser on this task and am willing to let go of control, in return it will choose how to do this itself with lower-level APIs that are more performant than anything I can write.”

For example, here are some approaches to animating transitions on the web where each step moves more responsibility from your JavaScript code on the main thread to the browser’s rendering engine:

- `setTimeout`
  - JS timers, DOM manipulation, browser repaints when it can. Dropped frames.
- `requestAnimationFrame`
  - Syncs to browser repaint cycle. Smooth, but you gotta handle a lot yourself (diffing, cleanup, etc.)
- View Transitions in JS
  - JS triggers, browser snapshots and animates. Native performance, but requires custom choreography on your part.
- View Transitions in CSS
  - Declare what you expect broadly, then let the browser take over.

It’s a scale from:

I want the most control, and in exchange I’ll worry about performance.

To:

I don’t need control, and in exchange you’ll worry about performance.

I don’t know about you, but I’d much rather hand over performance, accessibility, localization, and a whole host of issues to the experts who build browsers.

## It’s Trade-offs All the Way Down

Building on the web is a set of choices:

- Do it yourself.
- Let the browser do it.
- Somewhere in between.

Anytime you choose to do something yourself, you’re choosing to make a trade-off. Often that increase in control comes at the cost of a degradation in performance.

Why do it yourself? Often it’s because you want a specific amount of control over the experience you’re creating. That may be perfectly ok! But it should be a deliberate choice, not because you didn’t consider (or know) the browser offers you an alternative. Maybe it does!

So instead of asking yourself, “How can I write code that does what I want?” Consider asking yourself, “Can I write code that ties together things the browser already does to accomplish what I want (or close enough to it)?”

Building this way will likely improve your performance dramatically — not to mention decrease your maintenance burden dramatically!

      <source:markdown>No, honest, it did.

Windows 2 was kinda ugly.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win203](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win203)

Windows 3/3.1/3.11 were fine.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win30](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win30)

Muted, boring, but you could look at it all day. And we did.

95 improved it.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win95osr2](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win95osr2)

Tasteful greys, spot colour.

NT 4 improved that a bit more.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/winnt40](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/winnt40)

Categorised Start menu, for instance. But nearly identical.

95/NT4 were visibly inspired by NeXTstep, IMHO the most beautiful GUI ever written.

Then it all started to go a bit wrong. The first pebbles bouncing down the mountainside presaging a vast avalanche.

Windows 98.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win98](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win98)

IE4 built in so Microsoft didn&#39;t get broken up my the US DOJ. Explorer rendered local content via HTML. Ugly extra toolbars. Some floating, some embedded in the task bar. Ugly gradients and blends in window title bars.

Cheap and plastic and tacky.

_But_ that is around the time that media and gaming PCs went mainstream, home internet use (often over dialup) went mainstream, and the alternatives died out (Amiga, ST &#38; GEM, Arm &#38; RISC OS) or very nearly died (classic MacOS, NeXT merger, Rhapsody).

So it&#39;s what many saw first and loved and remembered.

Result, people write entire new OSes designed in affectionate homage:

[https://serenityos.org/](https://serenityos.org/)

Look at the toolbars. Look at the textures in the title bars. This isn&#39;t Win9x, this is specifically Win98.

[https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/i...](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/index.htm)

Specifically:

[https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/h...](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/hansen1.jpg)

&#60;\- textured title bars

[https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/t...](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/tinypanel.jpg)

&#60;\- gradients in title bars

[https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/m...](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/matthiase2.jpg)

&#60;\- Windows-style colour schemes

KDE started out as a reproduction of Windows 98/98SE by a team who didn&#39;t realise that what they were looking at was WordPerfect 5.x instead of WordPerfect 4.x -- as the late great Guy Kewney put it:

&#34;WordPerfect 4.2 was a bicycle. A great bicycle. Everyone agreed it was a great bicycle, just about _the_ best. So what Wordperfect did was, they put together a committee, looked at the market, and said: &#39;what we&#39;ll do is, we&#39;ll put 11 more wheels on it&#39;.&#34;

Win98 is Win95 festooned with pointless needless Internet widgetry because the DOJ was about to split MS into separate apps and OS companies, because MS drove Netscape into bankruptcy by bundling IE free of charge with Windows.

Strip all that junk off and what&#39;s left underneath is a better UI. But the German kids writing their &#34;Kool Desktop Environment&#34; didn&#39;t realise.

After that came WinME and Windows 2000, which turned down the bling a bit as the lawsuit was over, but it was only a blip.

Then came XP with its &#34;Fischer-Price&#34; themes.

Then Vista with gratuitous transparency everywhere because GDI.EXE had been ripped out and replaced with a compositor and that&#39;s no fun if you don&#39;t use some 3D features like see-through stuff.

Then 7 toned that down a bit and everyone love it.

Then the universally detested Win8, and then that was toned down and the Start menu put back for Win10, which is roughly what UKUI and Deepin copied in China, or Wubuntu in the West.

Then Win11, as copied by AnduinOS and a few others, which for this long-term Windows user is the worst release ever. I can&#39;t even have a vertical taskbar any more. It&#39;s abhorrent.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Regular readers know that I maintain <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/"><code>gssr</code></a> and <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/"><code>gssrdoc</code></a>, two packages for <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>. The former makes the <a href="http://gss.norc.org/">General Social Survey</a>&rsquo;s annual, cumulative and panel datasets available in a way that&rsquo;s easy to use in R. The latter makes the survey&rsquo;s codebook available in R&rsquo;s integrated help system in a way that documents every GSS variable as if it were a function or object in R, so you can query them in exactly the same way as any function from the R console or in the IDE of your choice. As a bonus, because I use <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org"><code>pkgdown</code></a> to document the packages, I get a website as a side-effect. In the case of <code>gssrdoc</code> this means <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/reference/index.html">a browsable index of all the GSS variables</a>. The GSS is the Hubble Space Telescope of American social science; our longest-running representative view of many aspects of the character and opinions of American households. The data is <a href="https://gss.norc.org">freely available from NORC</a>, but they distribute it in SPSS, SAS, and STATA formats. I wrote these packages in an effort to make it more easily available in <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>. If you want to know the relationship between these various platforms, <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2019/02/07/statswars/">I have you covered</a>. But the important thing is that R is a free and open-source project, and the others are not.</p>
        <p>This week I spent a little time updating <code>gssrdoc</code> a bit to clean up how the help pages looked and make some other improvements. Inside R, you can say, e.g., <code>?govdook</code> at the console and have this pop up in the help:</p>

                 alt="RStudio with help page for govdook"/></a><figcaption>
                    <p>Yeah govdook is short for &lsquo;Gov Do OK&rsquo;, not &lsquo;Go v Dook&rsquo;.</p>
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The package also includes <code>gss_doc</code>, a data frame containing all of the information that the help pages are built from. I included it because it can be useful to work with directly, as when you might want to extract summary information about a subset of variables.</p>

        <p>The <code>gss_doc</code> object has regular columns but also a series of <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html">list-columns</a> to (insert meme here, you know the one) put data frames inside your data frames. (They&rsquo;re labeled as &ldquo;<a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org">tibbles</a>&rdquo; here; basically the same thing).</p>
        <p>Why a list-column? Why a list? Well, a list is one of the fundamental ways to store data of any sort. Lists are useful because they can contain heterogeneous elements:</p>

        <p>In its bones, R is a LISP/Scheme-like list-processing language fused with features of classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming">array languages</a> like APL. This is because, in the world of data analysis, what we deal with all the time are rectangular tables, or arrays, where rows are cases and columns are different sorts of variables. The wrinkle is that, unlike a beautiful array of pure numbers, each column might measure something (a date, a True/False answer, a location, a score, a nationality) that we&rsquo;d prefer not to represent directly as a number. Sure, underneath in the computer everything is all just ones and zeros. (Or rather, electromagnetic patterns in some physical substrate that we can interpret as meaning ones and zeros.) And if we want to do any sort of data analysis that involves treating our table as a matrix then we&rsquo;ll want numeric representations of all the columns. But for many uses we&rsquo;d like to see &ldquo;France&rdquo; or &ldquo;Strongly Agree&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;33&rdquo; or &ldquo;5&rdquo;. Just a table of rows and columns, where different things can be represented across columns, but any particular column is all the same kind of thing.</p>
        <p>A rectangular table like that is called a data frame. One way to think of a data frame is just as a special case of a list. A data frame is a list where you can put all the list elements side by side and treat them as columns, and where all these elements are made of vectors of the same length. Beyond that, it&rsquo;s a list where the nth element of each vector refers to some property of the same underlying entity, i.e. the thing that&rsquo;s in the row, or case; the thing the columns are showing you measurements or properties of. You can have empty entries if needed, as when some bit of data is missing. The important thing is that each column has as many slots as there are cases, and you fill in the values for each case in the same slot in each column. Whenever you look at any table of data, one of your first questions should always be &ldquo;What is a row in this table?&rdquo; In this case, each row is a variable in the full GSS dataset, and each column describes some property of that variable.</p>

        <p>Because R was designed by statisticians&mdash;R is a descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)">S</a>, which like everything else in computing traces its origins to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)">Bell Labs</a>&mdash;it has this concept of a data frame built-in to its core instead of being bolted-on afterwards, which is extremely handy. Normally data frames are just ordinary rectangles, but there&rsquo;s no reason why any particular column can&rsquo;t itself be thought of as a list of something else. That&rsquo;s what we have here. The <code>yr_vartab</code> column contains data frames of crosstabs of the answers to each question by year. Except where it doesn&rsquo;t (e.g. for <code>id</code>), and this is fine because lists don&rsquo;t have to be internally homogeneous. Similarly <code>yrballot_df</code> has a little table of which ballots, or internal portions of the survey, a question was asked on for each year it was asked.</p>
        <p>The upshot is that having assembled the <code>gss_doc</code> object we can use it to emit, like, seven thousand pages of documentation on the GSS&rsquo;s many, many questions over the years. We can build them as standardized R help pages, as above. On the <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/index.html">website</a> that <code>pgkdown</code> builds for us, we get this:</p>

                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The cross-referencing to other relevant variables in the &ldquo;See Also&rdquo; section is new in this version. It comes courtesy of the GSS&rsquo;s own information about survey modules and an ad hoc topic index they keep for the variables. I just use a subset of possible cross-references as we don&rsquo;t want, e.g., every single question in the GSS core to be cross-referenced to every other core question on any particular help page. On the website, I gather these into a <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/articles/topics.html">single page</a>:</p>

                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The GSS has its own handy <a href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org">data explorer</a> which is very useful for quickly checking on particular trends and getting a quick graph of what the data look like, or a summary view of the content of particular variables. Each help page in <code>gssrdoc</code> now links to the GSS Data Explorer page for that variable, in case you want to hop over and take a look there. Of course, the <code>gssrdoc</code> package doesn&rsquo;t and isn&rsquo;t meant to replace the Data Explorer; it&rsquo;s just a different view of the same information, with a different use-case in mind.</p>]]>
      </description>
      <source:markdown>Regular readers know that I maintain [`gssr`](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/) and [`gssrdoc`](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/), two packages for [R](https://www.r-project.org). The former makes the [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org/)’s annual, cumulative and panel datasets available in a way that’s easy to use in R. The latter makes the survey’s codebook available in R’s integrated help system in a way that documents every GSS variable as if it were a function or object in R, so you can query them in exactly the same way as any function from the R console or in the IDE of your choice. As a bonus, because I use [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org) to document the packages, I get a website as a side-effect. In the case of `gssrdoc` this means [a browsable index of all the GSS variables](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/reference/index.html). The GSS is the Hubble Space Telescope of American social science; our longest-running representative view of many aspects of the character and opinions of American households. The data is [freely available from NORC](https://gss.norc.org), but they distribute it in SPSS, SAS, and STATA formats. I wrote these packages in an effort to make it more easily available in [R](https://www.r-project.org). If you want to know the relationship between these various platforms, [I have you covered](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2019/02/07/statswars/). But the important thing is that R is a free and open-source project, and the others are not.

This week I spent a little time updating `gssrdoc` a bit to clean up how the help pages looked and make some other improvements. Inside R, you can say, e.g., `?govdook` at the console and have this pop up in the help:

[![RStudio with help page for govdook](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-rstudio.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-rstudio.png)

Yeah govdook is short for ‘Gov Do OK’, not ‘Go v Dook’.

The package also includes `gss_doc`, a data frame containing all of the information that the help pages are built from. I included it because it can be useful to work with directly, as when you might want to extract summary information about a subset of variables.

The `gss_doc` object has regular columns but also a series of [list-columns](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html) to (insert meme here, you know the one) put data frames inside your data frames. (They’re labeled as “ [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org)” here; basically the same thing).

Why a list-column? Why a list? Well, a list is one of the fundamental ways to store data of any sort. Lists are useful because they can contain heterogeneous elements:

One thing to notice about a list like this is that it doesn’t really make sense to represent it as a table. This is partly because the elements of the list are of different lengths, but really it’s because if we _did_ represent it as a table, it would not mean anything to read across the rows:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

```

```r
items_df
#&#62; # A tibble: 4 × 4
#&#62;   todo_home              important_dates keycode storage_tiers
#&#62;   &#60;chr&#62;                  &#60;date&#62;            &#60;int&#62;         &#60;int&#62;
#&#62; 1 Laundry                1776-07-04      8675309           128

#&#62; 4 Bring out rubbish bins -                    -           1024
```

The rows don’t form “cases” of anything. We just have four unrelated categories with various pieces of information in them.

Lists are also useful because they lend themselves easily to being nested:

In its bones, R is a LISP/Scheme-like list-processing language fused with features of classic [array languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming) like APL. This is because, in the world of data analysis, what we deal with all the time are rectangular tables, or arrays, where rows are cases and columns are different sorts of variables. The wrinkle is that, unlike a beautiful array of pure numbers, each column might measure something (a date, a True/False answer, a location, a score, a nationality) that we’d prefer not to represent directly as a number. Sure, underneath in the computer everything is all just ones and zeros. (Or rather, electromagnetic patterns in some physical substrate that we can interpret as meaning ones and zeros.) And if we want to do any sort of data analysis that involves treating our table as a matrix then we’ll want numeric representations of all the columns. But for many uses we’d like to see “France” or “Strongly Agree” instead of “33” or “5”. Just a table of rows and columns, where different things can be represented across columns, but any particular column is all the same kind of thing.

A rectangular table like that is called a data frame. One way to think of a data frame is just as a special case of a list. A data frame is a list where you can put all the list elements side by side and treat them as columns, and where all these elements are made of vectors of the same length. Beyond that, it’s a list where the nth element of each vector refers to some property of the same underlying entity, i.e. the thing that’s in the row, or case; the thing the columns are showing you measurements or properties of. You can have empty entries if needed, as when some bit of data is missing. The important thing is that each column has as many slots as there are cases, and you fill in the values for each case in the same slot in each column. Whenever you look at any table of data, one of your first questions should always be “What is a row in this table?” In this case, each row is a variable in the full GSS dataset, and each column describes some property of that variable.

Because R was designed by statisticians—R is a descendant of [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which like everything else in computing traces its origins to [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language))—it has this concept of a data frame built-in to its core instead of being bolted-on afterwards, which is extremely handy. Normally data frames are just ordinary rectangles, but there’s no reason why any particular column can’t itself be thought of as a list of something else. That’s what we have here. The `yr_vartab` column contains data frames of crosstabs of the answers to each question by year. Except where it doesn’t (e.g. for `id`), and this is fine because lists don’t have to be internally homogeneous. Similarly `yrballot_df` has a little table of which ballots, or internal portions of the survey, a question was asked on for each year it was asked.

The upshot is that having assembled the `gss_doc` object we can use it to emit, like, seven thousand pages of documentation on the GSS’s many, many questions over the years. We can build them as standardized R help pages, as above. On the [website](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/index.html) that `pgkdown` builds for us, we get this:

[![Website view.](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-varpage.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-varpage.png)

Website view.

The cross-referencing to other relevant variables in the “See Also” section is new in this version. It comes courtesy of the GSS’s own information about survey modules and an ad hoc topic index they keep for the variables. I just use a subset of possible cross-references as we don’t want, e.g., every single question in the GSS core to be cross-referenced to every other core question on any particular help page. On the website, I gather these into a [single page](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/articles/topics.html):

[![Topic index page.](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-topics.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-topics.png)

Topic index page.

The GSS has its own handy [data explorer](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org) which is very useful for quickly checking on particular trends and getting a quick graph of what the data look like, or a summary view of the content of particular variables. Each help page in `gssrdoc` now links to the GSS Data Explorer page for that variable, in case you want to hop over and take a look there. Of course, the `gssrdoc` package doesn’t and isn’t meant to replace the Data Explorer; it’s just a different view of the same information, with a different use-case in mind.</source:markdown>

Is it you, dear reader? Is it one of the people following along on fedi? As soon as I posted that [my setup](https://transjovian.org/view/fighting-bots/) had been working fine for weeks without requiring any intervention, I find that it’s in fact not working fine.

![A few hours ago, load climbed to 100 and more.](2025-10-19-every-time-1.png)

I don’t have time for this right now, so I just tightened the screws and will let things run (or not) as they will.

At least this blog still works! Emacs Wiki and a few others are probably down, though.

        Chapter 4: Advanced Architectures In this chapter, we move from the foundational architecture of our city to its most modern structures. We’ll explore the street market of Wi-Fi, the diplomatic enclave of modern encryption, and the logic-driven world of the service mesh. These are the systems that power the most demanding applications on the internet. They might seem complex at first, but as you’ll see, they are all built on the same fundamental principles of address, path, and permission we’ve been using all along.]]>

&#62; All U.S. data centers (which mostly support the internet, not AI) used [200--250 million](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/i-was-wrong-about-data-center-water) gallons of freshwater daily in 2023.

      <title>Andrej Karpathy — AGI is still a decade away</title>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy">Andrej Karpathy — AGI is still a decade away</a></strong></p>
        Extremely high signal 2 hour 25 minute (!) conversation between Andrej Karpathy and Dwarkesh Patel.</p>
        <p>It starts with Andrej's claim that "the year of agents" is actually more likely to take a decade. Seeing as I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/#claude-as-a-general-agent">accepted 2025 as the year of agents</a> just yesterday this instantly caught my attention!</p>
        <p>It turns out Andrej is using a different definition of agents to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/">the one that I prefer</a> - emphasis mine:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>When you’re talking about an agent, or what the labs have in mind and maybe what I have in mind as well, you should <strong>think of it almost like an employee or an intern that you would hire to work with you</strong>. For example, you work with some employees here. When would you prefer to have an agent like Claude or Codex do that work?</p>
        <p>Currently, of course they can’t. What would it take for them to be able to do that? Why don’t you do it today? The reason you don’t do it today is because they just don’t work. <strong>They don’t have enough intelligence, they’re not multimodal enough, they can’t do computer use and all this stuff</strong>.</p>
        <p>They don’t do a lot of the things you’ve alluded to earlier. <strong>They don’t have continual learning</strong>. You can’t just tell them something and they’ll remember it. They’re cognitively lacking and it’s just not working. It will take about a decade to work through all of those issues.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Yeah, continual learning human-replacement agents definitely isn't happening in 2025! Coding agents that are <em>really good</em> at running tools in the loop on the other hand are here already.</p>
        <p>I loved this bit introducing an analogy of LLMs as ghosts or spirits, as opposed to having brains like animals or humans:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Brains just came from a very different process, and I’m very hesitant to take inspiration from it because we’re not actually running that process. In my post, I said we’re not building animals. We’re building ghosts or spirits or whatever people want to call it, because we’re not doing training by evolution. We’re doing training by imitation of humans and the data that they’ve put on the Internet.</p>
        <p>You end up with these ethereal spirit entities because they’re fully digital and they’re mimicking humans. It’s a different kind of intelligence. If you imagine a space of intelligences, we’re starting off at a different point almost. We’re not really building animals. But it’s also possible to make them a bit more animal-like over time, and I think we should be doing that.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The post Andrej mentions is <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/animals-vs-ghosts/">Animals vs Ghosts</a> on his blog.</p>
        <p>Dwarkesh asked Andrej about <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1977758204139331904">this tweet</a> where he said that Claude Code and Codex CLI "didn't work well enough at all and net unhelpful" for his <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/13/nanochat/">nanochat project</a>. Andrej responded:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>[...] So the agents are pretty good, for example, if you’re doing boilerplate stuff. Boilerplate code that’s just copy-paste stuff, they’re very good at that. They’re very good at stuff that occurs very often on the Internet because there are lots of examples of it in the training sets of these models. There are features of things where the models will do very well.</p>
        <p>I would say nanochat is not an example of those because it’s a fairly unique repository. There’s not that much code in the way that I’ve structured it. It’s not boilerplate code. It’s intellectually intense code almost, and everything has to be very precisely arranged. The models have so many cognitive deficits. One example, they kept misunderstanding the code because they have too much memory from all the typical ways of doing things on the Internet that I just wasn’t adopting.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: Here's an <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1979644538185752935">essay length tweet</a> from Andrej clarifying a whole bunch of the things he talked about on the podcast.

      <source:markdown>**[Andrej Karpathy — AGI is still a decade away](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy)**

Extremely high signal 2 hour 25 minute (!) conversation between Andrej Karpathy and Dwarkesh Patel.

It starts with Andrej&#39;s claim that &#34;the year of agents&#34; is actually more likely to take a decade. Seeing as I [accepted 2025 as the year of agents](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/#claude-as-a-general-agent) just yesterday this instantly caught my attention!

It turns out Andrej is using a different definition of agents to [the one that I prefer](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/) \- emphasis mine:

&#62; When you’re talking about an agent, or what the labs have in mind and maybe what I have in mind as well, you should **think of it almost like an employee or an intern that you would hire to work with you**. For example, you work with some employees here. When would you prefer to have an agent like Claude or Codex do that work?

Yeah, continual learning human-replacement agents definitely isn&#39;t happening in 2025! Coding agents that are _really good_ at running tools in the loop on the other hand are here already.

But it’s also possible to make them a bit more animal-like over time, and I think we should be doing that.

The post Andrej mentions is [Animals vs Ghosts](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/animals-vs-ghosts/) on his blog.

Dwarkesh asked Andrej about [this tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1977758204139331904) where he said that Claude Code and Codex CLI &#34;didn&#39;t work well enough at all and net unhelpful&#34; for his [nanochat project](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/13/nanochat/). Andrej responded:

&#62; \[...\] So the agents are pretty good, for example, if you’re doing boilerplate stuff. Boilerplate code that’s just copy-paste stuff, they’re very good at that. They’re very good at stuff that occurs very often on the Internet because there are lots of examples of it in the training sets of these models.

One example, they kept misunderstanding the code because they have too much memory from all the typical ways of doing things on the Internet that I just wasn’t adopting.

**Update**: Here&#39;s an [essay length tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1979644538185752935) from Andrej clarifying a whole bunch of the things he talked about on the podcast.

      <title>Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Anthropic this morning <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills">introduced Claude Skills</a>, a new pattern for making new abilities available to their models:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Claude can now use <em>Skills</em> to improve how it performs specific tasks. Skills are folders that include instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude can load when needed.</p>
        <p>Claude will only access a skill when it's relevant to the task at hand. When used, skills make Claude better at specialized tasks like working with Excel or following your organization's brand guidelines.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Their engineering blog has a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills">more detailed explanation</a>. There's also a new <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills">anthropics/skills</a> GitHub repo.</p>
        <p>(I inadvertently preempted their announcement of this feature when I reverse engineered and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/10/claude-skills/">wrote about it last Friday</a>!)</p>
        <p>Skills are conceptually extremely simple: a skill is a Markdown file telling the model how to do something, optionally accompanied by extra documents and pre-written scripts that the model can run to help it accomplish the tasks described by the skill.</p>
        <p>Claude's new <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files">document creation abilities</a>, which accompanied <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/">their new code interpreter feature</a> in September, turned out to be entirely implemented using skills. Those are <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/document-skills">now available in Anthropic's repo</a> covering <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>, and <code>.pptx</code> files.</p>
        <p>There's one extra detail that makes this a feature, not just a bunch of files on disk. At the start of a session Claude's various harnesses can scan all available skill files and read a short explanation for each one from the frontmatter YAML in the Markdown file. This is <em>very</em> token efficient: each skill only takes up a few dozen extra tokens, with the full details only loaded in should the user request a task that the skill can help solve.</p>

        <p>Back in January I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/10/ai-predictions/">made some foolhardy predictions about AI/LLMs</a>, including that "agents" would once again fail to happen:</p>

I expect a lot of money will be lost chasing after several different poorly defined dreams that share that name.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I was entirely wrong about that. 2025 really has been the year of "agents", no matter which of the many <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/agent-definitions/">conflicting definitions</a> you decide to use (I eventually settled on "<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/">tools in a loop</a>").</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> is, with hindsight, poorly named.

It's best described as a <strong>general agent</strong>. Skills make this a whole lot more obvious and explicit.</p>
        <p>I find the potential applications of this trick somewhat dizzying. Just thinking about this with my data journalism hat on: imagine a folder full of skills that covers tasks like the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Where to get US census data from and how to understand its structure</li>
        <li>How to load data from different formats into SQLite or DuckDB using appropriate Python libraries</li>
        <li>How to publish data online, as Parquet files in S3 or pushed as tables to Datasette Cloud</li>
        <li>A skill defined by an experienced data reporter talking about how best to find the interesting stories in a new set of data</li>
        <li>A skill that describes how to build clean, readable data visualizations using D3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Congratulations, you just built a "data journalism agent" that can discover and help publish stories against fresh drops of US census data. And you did it with a folder full of Markdown files and maybe a couple of example Python scripts.</p>
        <h4 id="skills-compared-to-mcp">Skills compared to MCP</h4>
        <p><a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a> has attracted an enormous amount of buzz since its initial release back <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/25/model-context-protocol/">in November last year</a>. I like to joke that one of the reasons it took off is that every company knew they needed an "AI strategy", and building (or announcing) an MCP implementation was an easy way to tick that box.</p>
        <p>Over time the limitations of MCP have started to emerge. The most significant is in terms of token usage: GitHub's official MCP on its own famously consumes tens of thousands of tokens of context, and once you've added a few more to that there's precious little space left for the LLM to actually do useful work.</p>
        <p>My own interest in MCPs has waned ever since I started taking coding agents seriously. Almost everything I might achieve with an MCP can be handled by a CLI tool instead. LLMs know how to call <code>cli-tool --help</code>, which means you don't have to spend many tokens describing how to use them - the model can figure it out later when it needs to.</p>
        <p>Skills have exactly the same advantage, only now I don't even need to implement a new CLI tool. I can drop a Markdown file in describing how to do a task instead, adding extra scripts only if they'll help make things more reliable or efficient.</p>
        <h4 id="here-come-the-skills">Here come the Skills</h4>
        <p>One of the most exciting things about Skills is how easy they are to share. I expect many skills will be implemented as a single file - more sophisticated ones will be a folder with a few more.</p>
        <p>Anthropic have <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview">Agent Skills documentation</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/skills">Claude Skills Cookbook</a>. I'm already thinking through ideas of skills I might build myself, like one on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/8/claude-datasette-plugins/">how to build Datasette plugins</a>.</p>
        <p>Something else I love about the design of skills is there is nothing at all preventing them from being used with other models.</p>
        <p>You can grab a skills folder right now, point Codex CLI or Gemini CLI at it and say "read pdf/SKILL.md and then create me a PDF describing this project" and it will work, despite those tools and models having no baked in knowledge of the skills system.</p>
        <p>I expect we'll see a Cambrian explosion in Skills which will make this year's MCP rush look pedestrian by comparison.</p>
        <h4 id="the-simplicity-is-the-point">The simplicity is the point</h4>
        <p>I've seen a some push back against skills as being so simple they're hardly a feature at all. Plenty of people have experimented with the trick of dropping extra instructions into a Markdown file and telling the coding agent to read that file before continuing with a task. <a href="https://agents.md/">AGENTS.md</a> is a well established pattern, and that file can already include instructions to "Read PDF.md before attempting to create a PDF".</p>
        <p>The core simplicity of the skills design is why I'm so excited about it.</p>
        <p>MCP is a whole <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18">protocol specification</a>, covering hosts, clients, servers, resources, prompts, tools, sampling, roots, elicitation and three different transports (stdio, streamable HTTP and originally SSE).</p>
        <p>Skills are Markdown with a tiny bit of YAML metadata and some optional scripts in whatever you can make executable in the environment. They feel a lot closer to the spirit of LLMs - throw in some text and let the model figure it out.</p>
        <p>They outsource the hard parts to the LLM harness and the associated computer environment. Given everything we have learned about LLMs' ability to run tools over the last couple of years I think that's a very sensible strategy.</p>

      <source:markdown>Anthropic this morning [introduced Claude Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills), a new pattern for making new abilities available to their models:

&#62; Claude can now use _Skills_ to improve how it performs specific tasks. Skills are folders that include instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude can load when needed.
&#62;
&#62; Claude will only access a skill when it&#39;s relevant to the task at hand. When used, skills make Claude better at specialized tasks like working with Excel or following your organization&#39;s brand guidelines.

Their engineering blog has a [more detailed explanation](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills). There&#39;s also a new [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) GitHub repo.

(I inadvertently preempted their announcement of this feature when I reverse engineered and [wrote about it last Friday](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/10/claude-skills/)!)

Skills are conceptually extremely simple: a skill is a Markdown file telling the model how to do something, optionally accompanied by extra documents and pre-written scripts that the model can run to help it accomplish the tasks described by the skill.

Claude&#39;s new [document creation abilities](https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files), which accompanied [their new code interpreter feature](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/) in September, turned out to be entirely implemented using skills. Those are [now available in Anthropic&#39;s repo](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/document-skills) covering `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, and `.pptx` files.

There&#39;s one extra detail that makes this a feature, not just a bunch of files on disk. At the start of a session Claude&#39;s various harnesses can scan all available skill files and read a short explanation for each one from the frontmatter YAML in the Markdown file. This is _very_ token efficient: each skill only takes up a few dozen extra tokens, with the full details only loaded in should the user request a task that the skill can help solve.

#### Trying out the slack-gif-creator skill

Here&#39;s that metadata for an example [slack-gif-creator skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/slack-gif-creator/SKILL.md) that Anthropic published this morning:

&#62; Toolkit for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack, with validators for size constraints and composable animation primitives. This skill applies when users request animated GIFs or emoji animations for Slack from descriptions like &#34;make me a GIF for Slack of X doing Y&#34;.

I just tried this skill out in the Claude mobile web app, against Sonnet 4.5. First I enabled the slack-gif-creator skill [in the settings](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities), then I prompted:

&#62; `Make me a gif for slack about how Skills are way cooler than MCPs`

And Claude [made me this GIF](https://claude.ai/share/eff7ae7b-b386-417b-9fa0-213fa76ace6e). Click to play (it&#39;s almost epilepsy inducing, hence the click-to-play mechanism):

![](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills_vs_mcps_still.gif)

OK, this particular GIF is terrible, but the great thing about skills is that they&#39;re very easy to iterate on to make them better.

Here are some noteworthy snippets from [the Python script it wrote](https://gist.github.com/simonw/ef35bb9e6c514d1d596dac9227da482b), comments mine:

```
# Start by adding the skill&#39;s directory to the Python path
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, &#39;/mnt/skills/examples/slack-gif-creator&#39;)

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
# This class lives in the core/ directory for the skill
from core.gif_builder import GIFBuilder

# ... code that builds the GIF ...

# Save it to disk:
info = builder.save(&#39;/mnt/user-data/outputs/skills_vs_mcps.gif&#39;,
                    num_colors=128,
                    optimize_for_emoji=False)

print(f&#34;GIF created successfully!&#34;)
print(f&#34;Size: {info[&#39;size_kb&#39;]:.1f} KB ({info[&#39;size_mb&#39;]:.2f} MB)&#34;)
print(f&#34;Frames: {info[&#39;frame_count&#39;]}&#34;)
print(f&#34;Duration: {info[&#39;duration_seconds&#39;]:.1f}s&#34;)

# Use the check_slack_size() function to confirm it&#39;s small enough for Slack:
passes, check_info = check_slack_size(&#39;/mnt/user-data/outputs/skills_vs_mcps.gif&#39;, is_emoji=False)
if passes:
    print(&#34;✓ Ready for Slack!&#34;)
else:
    print(f&#34;⚠ File size: {check_info[&#39;size_kb&#39;]:.1f} KB (limit: {check_info[&#39;limit_kb&#39;]} KB)&#34;)
```

This is pretty neat. Slack GIFs need to be a maximum of 2MB, so the skill includes a validation function which the model can use to check the file size. If it&#39;s too large the model can have another go at making it smaller.

#### Skills depend on a coding environment

The skills mechanism is _entirely dependent_ on the model having access to a filesystem, tools to navigate it and the ability to execute commands in that environment.

This is a common pattern for LLM tooling these days - ChatGPT Code Interpreter was the first big example of this [back in early 2023](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/12/code-interpreter/), and the pattern later extended to local machines via coding agent tools such as Cursor, Claude Code, Codex CLI and Gemini CLI.

This requirement is the biggest difference between skills and other previous attempts at expanding the abilities of LLMs, such as MCP and [ChatGPT Plugins](https://simonwillison.net/tags/chatgpt-plugins/). It&#39;s a significant dependency, but it&#39;s somewhat bewildering how much new capability it unlocks.

The fact that skills are so powerful and simple to create is yet another argument in favor of making safe coding environments available to LLMs. The word **safe** there is doing a _lot_ of work though! We really need to figure out how best to sandbox these environments such that attacks such as prompt injections are limited to an acceptable amount of damage.

#### Claude Code as a General Agent

Back in January I [made some foolhardy predictions about AI/LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/10/ai-predictions/), including that &#34;agents&#34; would once again fail to happen:

&#62; I think we are going to see a _lot_ more froth about agents in 2025, but I expect the results will be a great disappointment to most of the people who are excited about this term. I expect a lot of money will be lost chasing after several different poorly defined dreams that share that name.

I was entirely wrong about that. 2025 really has been the year of &#34;agents&#34;, no matter which of the many [conflicting definitions](https://simonwillison.net/tags/agent-definitions/) you decide to use (I eventually settled on &#34; [tools in a loop](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/)&#34;).

[Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) is, with hindsight, poorly named. It&#39;s not purely a coding tool: it&#39;s a tool for general computer automation. _Anything_ you can achieve by typing commands into a computer is something that can now be automated by Claude Code. It&#39;s best described as a **general agent**. Skills make this a whole lot more obvious and explicit.

I find the potential applications of this trick somewhat dizzying. Just thinking about this with my data journalism hat on: imagine a folder full of skills that covers tasks like the following:

- Where to get US census data from and how to understand its structure
- How to load data from different formats into SQLite or DuckDB using appropriate Python libraries
- How to publish data online, as Parquet files in S3 or pushed as tables to Datasette Cloud
- A skill defined by an experienced data reporter talking about how best to find the interesting stories in a new set of data
- A skill that describes how to build clean, readable data visualizations using D3

Congratulations, you just built a &#34;data journalism agent&#34; that can discover and help publish stories against fresh drops of US census data. And you did it with a folder full of Markdown files and maybe a couple of example Python scripts.

#### Skills compared to MCP

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) has attracted an enormous amount of buzz since its initial release back [in November last year](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/25/model-context-protocol/). I like to joke that one of the reasons it took off is that every company knew they needed an &#34;AI strategy&#34;, and building (or announcing) an MCP implementation was an easy way to tick that box.

Over time the limitations of MCP have started to emerge. The most significant is in terms of token usage: GitHub&#39;s official MCP on its own famously consumes tens of thousands of tokens of context, and once you&#39;ve added a few more to that there&#39;s precious little space left for the LLM to actually do useful work.

My own interest in MCPs has waned ever since I started taking coding agents seriously. Almost everything I might achieve with an MCP can be handled by a CLI tool instead. LLMs know how to call `cli-tool --help`, which means you don&#39;t have to spend many tokens describing how to use them - the model can figure it out later when it needs to.

Skills have exactly the same advantage, only now I don&#39;t even need to implement a new CLI tool. I can drop a Markdown file in describing how to do a task instead, adding extra scripts only if they&#39;ll help make things more reliable or efficient.

#### Here come the Skills

One of the most exciting things about Skills is how easy they are to share. I expect many skills will be implemented as a single file - more sophisticated ones will be a folder with a few more.

Anthropic have [Agent Skills documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) and a [Claude Skills Cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/skills). I&#39;m already thinking through ideas of skills I might build myself, like one on [how to build Datasette plugins](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/8/claude-datasette-plugins/).

Something else I love about the design of skills is there is nothing at all preventing them from being used with other models.

You can grab a skills folder right now, point Codex CLI or Gemini CLI at it and say &#34;read pdf/SKILL.md and then create me a PDF describing this project&#34; and it will work, despite those tools and models having no baked in knowledge of the skills system.

I expect we&#39;ll see a Cambrian explosion in Skills which will make this year&#39;s MCP rush look pedestrian by comparison.

#### The simplicity is the point

I&#39;ve seen a some push back against skills as being so simple they&#39;re hardly a feature at all. Plenty of people have experimented with the trick of dropping extra instructions into a Markdown file and telling the coding agent to read that file before continuing with a task. [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) is a well established pattern, and that file can already include instructions to &#34;Read PDF.md before attempting to create a PDF&#34;.

The core simplicity of the skills design is why I&#39;m so excited about it.

MCP is a whole [protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18), covering hosts, clients, servers, resources, prompts, tools, sampling, roots, elicitation and three different transports (stdio, streamable HTTP and originally SSE).

Skills are Markdown with a tiny bit of YAML metadata and some optional scripts in whatever you can make executable in the environment. They feel a lot closer to the spirit of LLMs - throw in some text and let the model figure it out.

They outsource the hard parts to the LLM harness and the associated computer environment. Given everything we have learned about LLMs&#39; ability to run tools over the last couple of years I think that&#39;s a very sensible strategy.

        <![CDATA[<h3><em>For October 8-14, 2025</em></h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. As you get older, the way you think about certain things changes. For example, when we were kids, we always thought it was unbelievable that Houdini died just because he got punched in the stomach. But now that we’ve grown older and wiser, we know that if someone punched us in the stomach, no matter how lightly, it would absolutely kill us immediately. So please don’t do that!</p>
        <hr/><h2>What We Enjoyed This Week</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.pointsincase.com/articles/play-by-play-of-this-years-goody-two-shoes-quarterfinal?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Play-by-Play of This Year’s Goody Two-Shoes Quarterfinal</strong></a><strong> by </strong><a href="https://www.pointsincase.com/author/clay-troup?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Clay Troup</strong></a><em> (Points in Case)</em> The goody two-shoes vocabulary and specifics in this piece are just terrific, and juxtaposing them with the tone of a play-by-play announcer is hilarious: “Certainly, he is a great goody two-shoes in the making, although if you look at his game, he really plays more like an egghead or a poindexter than your traditional toady.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.havehashad.com/hadposts/cheater?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Cheater</strong></a><strong> by </strong><a href="https://www.andrewgrahammartin.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Andrew Graham Martin</strong></a> <em>(HAD) </em>Though this piece is working in a more literary, experimental mode, it has a real short humor core: It’s got eleven distinct beats; it heightens beautifully; and it’s about a guy who can’t stop getting hit by busses. This is a great example of the effect titles and paragraph breaks (or lack thereof) have on a piece. If you retitled this something like, “All The Times You Survived Getting Hit By A Bus”, and separated each bus incident into its own paragraph, it would feel much more straightforwardly short humor-y. (For more on paragraph length and short humor, check out <a href="https://buttondown.com/humorouswriting/archive/a-short-humor-editing-technique/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this edition of our premium edition</a> from back in May.)

      <source:markdown>### _For October 8-14, 2025_

Hello and welcome to **A Newsletter of Humorous Writing**, a roundup of the week&#39;s finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. As you get older, the way you think about certain things changes. For example, when we were kids, we always thought it was unbelievable that Houdini died just because he got punched in the stomach. But now that we’ve grown older and wiser, we know that if someone punched us in the stomach, no matter how lightly, it would absolutely kill us immediately. So please don’t do that!

## What We Enjoyed This Week

[**Play-by-Play of This Year’s Goody Two-Shoes Quarterfinal**](https://www.pointsincase.com/articles/play-by-play-of-this-years-goody-two-shoes-quarterfinal?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414) **by** [**Clay Troup**](https://www.pointsincase.com/author/clay-troup?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414) _(Points in Case)_ The goody two-shoes vocabulary and specifics in this piece are just terrific, and juxtaposing them with the tone of a play-by-play announcer is hilarious: “Certainly, he is a great goody two-shoes in the making, although if you look at his game, he really plays more like an egghead or a poindexter than your traditional toady.”

[**Cheater**](https://www.havehashad.com/hadposts/cheater?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414) **by** [**Andrew Graham Martin**](https://www.andrewgrahammartin.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414) _(HAD)_ Though this piece is working in a more literary, experimental mode, it has a real short humor core: It’s got eleven distinct beats; it heightens beautifully; and it’s about a guy who can’t stop getting hit by busses. This is a great example of the effect titles and paragraph breaks (or lack thereof) have on a piece. If you retitled this something like, “All The Times You Survived Getting Hit By A Bus”, and separated each bus incident into its own paragraph, it would feel much more straightforwardly short humor-y. (For more on paragraph length and short humor, check out [this edition of our premium edition](https://buttondown.com/humorouswriting/archive/a-short-humor-editing-technique/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-414) from back in May.)

Earlier this year, I inherited a bunch of old Macs and computer parts, including the PowerBook 520 pictured above. And, for the past three years I&#39;ve been trying to visit VCF Midwest up in Chicago, where there&#39;s this odd blend of old computers, radio, broadcast gear... Honestly, it&#39;s hard to pin down exactly _what_ it is.

And I also had no idea how overwhelming the two-day event would be. Overwhelmingly _awesome_, that is.

        <p>I've been going back and forth on slides. I always do this. In the end I hate slides because I digress while going through them and skip ahead, end up wishing I hadn't used them. So I decided to compromise. I'll do the first three in some detail, and digress and go down tangents as I see fit. </p>
        <p>The three main slides.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Accomplishments of WordPress. </li>
        <li>Why podcasting retained its independence. </li>
        <li>Demo of WordLand. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>There were 20 or 30 more slides after that. </p>
        <p>So what I'll do is this. Present the first two in some detail, then page through the rest quickly and come back and do the demo. Also publish a link to the deck on my blog so people can scroll through them at their leisure. And once the demo is done, I'll answer questions. </p>
        <p>I have an idea that we can have a blogosphere that is as functional as podcasting. We just need users to get started, to get the idea off the ground. We don't have to accept the limits, we can have the full web if we want it. </p>]]>

I&#39;ve been going back and forth on slides. I always do this. In the end I hate slides because I digress while going through them and skip ahead, end up wishing I hadn&#39;t used them. So I decided to compromise. I&#39;ll do the first three in some detail, and digress and go down tangents as I see fit.

The three main slides.

1. Accomplishments of WordPress.
2. Why podcasting retained its independence.
3. Demo of WordLand.

There were 20 or 30 more slides after that.

So what I&#39;ll do is this. Present the first two in some detail, then page through the rest quickly and come back and do the demo. Also publish a link to the deck on my blog so people can scroll through them at their leisure. And once the demo is done, I&#39;ll answer questions.

I have an idea that we can have a blogosphere that is as functional as podcasting. We just need users to get started, to get the idea off the ground. We don&#39;t have to accept the limits, we can have the full web if we want it.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>**[NVIDIA DGX Spark + Apple Mac Studio = 4x Faster LLM Inference with EXO 1.0](https://blog.exolabs.net/nvidia-dgx-spark)**

EXO Labs wired a 256GB M3 Ultra Mac Studio up to an NVIDIA DGX Spark and got a 2.8x performance boost serving Llama-3.1 8B (FP16) with an 8,192 token prompt.

Their detailed explanation taught me a lot about LLM performance.

There are two key steps in executing a prompt. The first is the **prefill** phase that reads the incoming prompt and builds a KV cache for each of the transformer layers in the model. This is compute-bound as it needs to process every token in the input and perform large matrix multiplications across all of the layers to initialize the model&#39;s internal state.

Performance in the prefill stage influences TTFT - time‑to‑first‑token.

The second step is the **decode** phase, which generates the output one token at a time. This part is limited by memory bandwidth - there&#39;s less arithmetic, but each token needs to consider the entire KV cache.

Decode performance influences TPS - tokens per second.

EXO noted that the Spark has 100 TFLOPS but only 273GB/s of memory bandwidth, making it a better fit for prefill. The M3 Ultra has 26 TFLOPS but 819GB/s of memory bandwidth, making it ideal for the decode phase.

They run prefill on the Spark, streaming the KV cache to the Mac over 10Gb Ethernet. They can start streaming earlier layers while the later layers are still being calculated. Then the Mac runs the decode phase, returning tokens faster than if the Spark had run the full process end-to-end.

        <img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/quiet-ui.jpg" alt="From the homepage of Quiet UI, a mouse mascot in a hoodie using a laptop with the text: A UI library for the Web focusing on accessibility, longevity, performance, and simplicity" style="display: block">
        </browser-window>
        <p>As President of Web Components, it’s my duty to publicly comment on every Web Component library and framework that exists. Today I’m taking a look at <a href="https://quietui.org/">Quiet UI</a>, a new <a href="https://quietui.org/license">source-available</a> web component library soft-launched by <a href="https://www.laviska.com/">Cory LaViska</a>, the creator of <del>Shoelace</del> <a href="https://webawesome.com/">WebAwesome</a>. You might be asking <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45364358">“another UI library? But why?”</a> and that’s a good question, I’ll let Cory tell you <a href="https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/quietui-my-creative-outlet/">in his own words</a>…</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I wanted to play with bleeding edge features that weren’t available in all browsers yet… I wanted to take everything I learned from developing components over the years and challenge some ideas, try new things, and bake in opinions that I’ve traditionally veered away from. It felt liberating.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>“Play” as a foundation is compelling to me. A lot of writing and ancient programming advice says “Write the thing, then throw it away and write it again” and while that sounds like an incredible waste of time, your second draft understands the problem set better than the first and you can make smarter/different decisions. And as Cory points out, the last half-decade has been a heyday for Web APIs and browser interop, which means your components can be more robust with less code. Whether you use web components or not, it’s a good time to re-evaluate your component system and do some quality-of-life upgrades.</p>
        <p>Peeking at what’s inside the box of what Quiet UI has to offer, I’ve found some interesting concepts beyond the industry standard set of components. Let’s take a look…</p>
        <h2>Theming system</h2>
        <p>A design token <a href="https://quietui.org/docs/theming">theming system</a> is pretty standard fare for a component system. Out of the box you get a generous set of <a href="https://evilmartians.com/opensource/harmony">harmonious</a> static color primitives all based on <code>color-mix()</code> to generate a consistent palette.</p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/quiet-colors.jpg" alt="A 10-step color pallette with four tiers cof colors: primary, neutral, constructive, destructive" /></p>
        <p>With the static primitives, you get a set of “Adaptive Colors” for text, fill, and stroke colors. Rather than a numeric ramp, this ramp is a 5-stop vibrancy/loudness scale and each color ramp adapts to light and dark modes.</p>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/quiet-adaptive-colors.jpg" alt="The same four-tier color pallet but only 5-steps of colors" /></p>
        <p>It’s tempting to have an 11-step color ramp and then think your adaptive color ramp needs to also be 11-steps, but based on personal experience that leads to more contrast problems than it’s worth, so limiting the adaptive light/dark colors to 5-steps and the border and text ramps to 3-steps is a good idea. I applaud the restraint that went into that decision.</p>
        <p>It’s a minor thing aspect, but naming the color collections “primary”, “neutral”, “destructive”, and “constructive” are nice, semantic –yet generic– buckets for values. It wouldn’t be too difficult to add one or two more collections for extra spice.</p>
        <h2>Restyle native elements</h2>
        <p>Quiet’s “<a href="https://quietui.org/docs/restyle">Restyle</a>” stylesheet has a lot of appeal to me. It’s a cross between a CSS Reset and a default stylesheet to theme native elements to look like your design system components.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/quiet-restyle.jpg" alt="An HTML form with different types of inputs all custom styled" /></p>
        <figcaption>These are all plain ol' HTML</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I could see this as a nice offering so consumers of your design system can use regular ol’ HTML alongside the first-party components and it’ll all maintain the same look and feel because they’re using the same underlying token architecture.</p>
        <p>Adding to the base theme and restyle, you also get some global <a href="https://quietui.org/docs/css-utilities">CSS utilities</a> to glue everything together.</p>
        <h2>Useful utilities</h2>
        <p>The CSS utilities are nice but Quiet UI goes a bit further and offers a handful of helpful JavaScript utilities in the form of web component wrappers.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/include"><code>&lt;quiet-include&gt;</code></a> - HTML includes are a bit of a passion project for me, so this is nice to see.</li>
        <li><a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/infinite-scroller"><code>&lt;quiet-infinite-scroller&gt;</code></a> - No one wants to code their own virtual list, what a great addition.</li>
        <li><a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/transition-group"><code>&lt;quiet-transition-group&gt;</code></a> - Animations based on the Web Animations API. And if those animations aren’t good enough, you can check out Quiet UI’s <a href="https://github.com/quietui/scurry">Scurry</a> library.</li>
        <li>Also included are elements for <a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/intersection-observer">Intersection</a>, <a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/mutation-observer">Mutation</a>, and <a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/resize-observer">Resize</a> Observers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, I’m the kind of idiot who wants to learn how to handwrite observers, then not use them for awhile and forget how they work, then have to re-learn observer patterns from scratch every two years… but I could see how others would not want to do that.</p>
        <p>Abstracting away some of the more painful learning curves through a thin, declarative web component wrapper API seems like a smart decision.</p>
        <h2>Components and gimmicks galore!</h2>
        <p>Inside Quiet UI is an impressive number of components for a side project. There’s all the standard UI components like Accordion, Breadcrumbs, Cards, Dialog, etc. The documentation breaks off Form controls into its own little section, which makes sense because <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13711/elementinternals-and-form-associated-custom-elements/">form-associated custom elements</a> are a bit unique in webcomponents-land.</p>
        <p>But what I want to call special attention to is what I will lovingly refer to as “Gimmick Components”. A gimmick sounds bad, like a cheap trick, but I mean it in the “Aww, that’s cool, they didn’t have to do that, but that’s cool” sort of way. Quiet UI bundles tons of little non-everyday, nice-to-have components into the kit. As you start digging through the LEGO bin, the mental image of what you could build starts growing…</p>

        </ul>
        <p>And there’s a whole collection of smaller components dedicated to text formatting.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/bytes">Bytes</a> - This isn’t hard to do, but I’d rather have a component and call it done.</li>
        <li><a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/countdown">Countdown</a> - 8 out of 10 cats recommend this plugin. Check it out before the timer reaches zero.</li>

        <li><a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/number">Number</a> - I had an <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code> issue the other day, would have been nice not to have that issue.</li>
        <li><a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/number-ticker">Number Ticker</a> - Bosses love number go up!</li>

        <li><a href="https://quietui.org/docs/components/typewriter">Typewriter</a> - Taka-taka-taka-tak. Look like your favorite generative AI chat bots.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Like I said, there’s a lot of gimmicks inside of here. A lot of these are already available (or could be) as “Standalone” components, but bundled in with a consistent styling API makes it all that much nicer.</p>
        <p>I browse a lot of design systems everyday and they’re all the same boring collection of  20-30 components with different levels of Bootstrap / Material / Tailwind / ShadCN flavoring mixed in. These types of random, not-solely utilitarian components elevate Quiet UI above the pack.</p>
        <p>The gimmicks create an atmosphere of “Play” that’s part of Quiet UI’s foundation. It culminates into a feeling of “fun” instead of business, business, business. It ticks a box in my brain that if my UI needs some pizzazz or something a little unconventional like a countdown timer or a number ticker on a random Tuesday in November… Quiet UI might be a good base to build on. I’m seriously considering making this the default component set for all side projects going forward.</p>
        <p>Quiet UI? Oh, that’s the fun one.</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>![From the homepage of Quiet UI, a mouse mascot in a hoodie using a laptop with the text: A UI library for the Web focusing on accessibility, longevity, performance, and simplicity](https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/quiet-ui.jpg)

As President of Web Components, it’s my duty to publicly comment on every Web Component library and framework that exists. Today I’m taking a look at [Quiet UI](https://quietui.org/), a new [source-available](https://quietui.org/license) web component library soft-launched by [Cory LaViska](https://www.laviska.com/), the creator of Shoelace [WebAwesome](https://webawesome.com/). You might be asking [“another UI library? But why?”](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45364358) and that’s a good question, I’ll let Cory tell you [in his own words](https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/quietui-my-creative-outlet/)…

&#62; I wanted to play with bleeding edge features that weren’t available in all browsers yet… I wanted to take everything I learned from developing components over the years and challenge some ideas, try new things, and bake in opinions that I’ve traditionally veered away from. It felt liberating.

“Play” as a foundation is compelling to me. A lot of writing and ancient programming advice says “Write the thing, then throw it away and write it again” and while that sounds like an incredible waste of time, your second draft understands the problem set better than the first and you can make smarter/different decisions.

Whether you use web components or not, it’s a good time to re-evaluate your component system and do some quality-of-life upgrades.

Peeking at what’s inside the box of what Quiet UI has to offer, I’ve found some interesting concepts beyond the industry standard set of components. Let’s take a look…

## Theming system

A design token [theming system](https://quietui.org/docs/theming) is pretty standard fare for a component system. Out of the box you get a generous set of [harmonious](https://evilmartians.com/opensource/harmony) static color primitives all based on `color-mix()` to generate a consistent palette.

![A 10-step color pallette with four tiers cof colors: primary, neutral, constructive, destructive](https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/quiet-colors.jpg)

With the static primitives, you get a set of “Adaptive Colors” for text, fill, and stroke colors. Rather than a numeric ramp, this ramp is a 5-stop vibrancy/loudness scale and each color ramp adapts to light and dark modes.

![The same four-tier color pallet but only 5-steps of colors](https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/quiet-adaptive-colors.jpg)

I applaud the restraint that went into that decision.

It’s a minor thing aspect, but naming the color collections “primary”, “neutral”, “destructive”, and “constructive” are nice, semantic –yet generic– buckets for values. It wouldn’t be too difficult to add one or two more collections for extra spice.

## Restyle native elements

Quiet’s “ [Restyle](https://quietui.org/docs/restyle)” stylesheet has a lot of appeal to me. It’s a cross between a CSS Reset and a default stylesheet to theme native elements to look like your design system components.

![An HTML form with different types of inputs all custom styled](https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/quiet-restyle.jpg)

These are all plain ol&#39; HTML

I could see this as a nice offering so consumers of your design system can use regular ol’ HTML alongside the first-party components and it’ll all maintain the same look and feel because they’re using the same underlying token architecture.

Adding to the base theme and restyle, you also get some global [CSS utilities](https://quietui.org/docs/css-utilities) to glue everything together.

## Useful utilities

The CSS utilities are nice but Quiet UI goes a bit further and offers a handful of helpful JavaScript utilities in the form of web component wrappers.

- [`&#60;quiet-include&#62;`](https://quietui.org/docs/components/include) \- HTML includes are a bit of a passion project for me, so this is nice to see.
- [`&#60;quiet-infinite-scroller&#62;`](https://quietui.org/docs/components/infinite-scroller) \- No one wants to code their own virtual list, what a great addition.
- [`&#60;quiet-transition-group&#62;`](https://quietui.org/docs/components/transition-group) \- Animations based on the Web Animations API. And if those animations aren’t good enough, you can check out Quiet UI’s [Scurry](https://github.com/quietui/scurry) library.
- Also included are elements for [Intersection](https://quietui.org/docs/components/intersection-observer), [Mutation](https://quietui.org/docs/components/mutation-observer), and [Resize](https://quietui.org/docs/components/resize-observer) Observers.

Now, I’m the kind of idiot who wants to learn how to handwrite observers, then not use them for awhile and forget how they work, then have to re-learn observer patterns from scratch every two years… but I could see how others would not want to do that.

Abstracting away some of the more painful learning curves through a thin, declarative web component wrapper API seems like a smart decision.

## Components and gimmicks galore!

Inside Quiet UI is an impressive number of components for a side project. There’s all the standard UI components like Accordion, Breadcrumbs, Cards, Dialog, etc. The documentation breaks off Form controls into its own little section, which makes sense because [form-associated custom elements](https://webkit.org/blog/13711/elementinternals-and-form-associated-custom-elements/) are a bit unique in webcomponents-land.

But what I want to call special attention to is what I will lovingly refer to as “Gimmick Components”. A gimmick sounds bad, like a cheap trick, but I mean it in the “Aww, that’s cool, they didn’t have to do that, but that’s cool” sort of way. Quiet UI bundles tons of little non-everyday, nice-to-have components into the kit. As you start digging through the LEGO bin, the mental image of what you could build starts growing…

- [Browser Frame](https://quietui.org/docs/components/browser-frame) \- A one-off to frame screenshots or make a section feel more web-like.
- [Comparison](https://quietui.org/docs/components/comparison) \- Don’t always need a responsive image compare tool, but I know I don’t want to build my own.
- [Expander](https://quietui.org/docs/components/expander) \- Truncation happens… and it’s nice to have a good option right out of the box.
- [Flip Card](https://quietui.org/docs/components/flip-card) \- Few know how to master this CSS-trickery.
- [Joystick](https://quietui.org/docs/components/joystick) \- A design system with a joystick? Novel.
- [QR Code](https://quietui.org/docs/components/qr) \- It’s Friday and the marketing team needs a website by Monday.
- [Slide Activator](https://quietui.org/docs/components/slide-activator) \- Slide to activate! In a website!
- [Sparkline](https://quietui.org/docs/components/sparkline) \- A matter of time before someone asks for a baby chart.
- [Random Content](https://quietui.org/docs/components/random-content) \- Spicy Lorem Ipsum!
- [Timed Content](https://quietui.org/docs/components/timed-content) \- The holiday campaign goes live when you’re asleep and must end when you’re unwrapping presents with your family. And there’s a code freeze.
- [Zoomable Frame](https://quietui.org/docs/components/zoomable-frame) \- Browse infinite canvases with ease.

And there’s a whole collection of smaller components dedicated to text formatting.

- [Bytes](https://quietui.org/docs/components/bytes) \- This isn’t hard to do, but I’d rather have a component and call it done.
- [Countdown](https://quietui.org/docs/components/countdown) \- 8 out of 10 cats recommend this plugin. Check it out before the timer reaches zero.
- [Fit Text](https://quietui.org/docs/components/fit-text) \- Feel like I’ve heard about this somewhere…
- [Number](https://quietui.org/docs/components/number) \- I had an `Intl.NumberFormat` issue the other day, would have been nice not to have that issue.
- [Number Ticker](https://quietui.org/docs/components/number-ticker) \- Bosses love number go up!
- [Relative Time](https://quietui.org/docs/components/relative-time) \- Again, `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`… not the funnest one to get sucked into.
- [Text Mask](https://quietui.org/docs/components/text-mask) \- An old effect, but a goodie.
- [Typewriter](https://quietui.org/docs/components/typewriter) \- Taka-taka-taka-tak. Look like your favorite generative AI chat bots.

Like I said, there’s a lot of gimmicks inside of here. A lot of these are already available (or could be) as “Standalone” components, but bundled in with a consistent styling API makes it all that much nicer.

I browse a lot of design systems everyday and they’re all the same boring collection of 20-30 components with different levels of Bootstrap / Material / Tailwind / ShadCN flavoring mixed in. These types of random, not-solely utilitarian components elevate Quiet UI above the pack.

The gimmicks create an atmosphere of “Play” that’s part of Quiet UI’s foundation. It culminates into a feeling of “fun” instead of business, business, business. It ticks a box in my brain that if my UI needs some pizzazz or something a little unconventional like a countdown timer or a number ticker on a random Tuesday in November… Quiet UI might be a good base to build on. I’m seriously considering making this the default component set for all side projects going forward.

Quiet UI? Oh, that’s the fun one.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Last year the most useful exercise for getting a feel for how good LLMs were at writing code was vibe coding (before that name had even been coined) - seeing if you could create a useful small application through prompting alone.

Today I think there&#39;s a new, more ambitious and significantly more intimidating exercise: spend a day working on **real production code** through prompting alone, making no manual edits yourself.

This doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t control exactly what goes into each file - you can even tell the model &#34;update line 15 to use this instead&#34; if you have to - but it&#39;s a great way to get more of a feel for how well the latest coding agents can wield their edit tools.

      <source:markdown># 2025-10-14 Israel: So that we won’t say we didn’t know

We are [travelling through Portugal these days](2025-portugal). I brought a bunch of newspapers along – to read should I manage to put down the phone. I just read [Kollidierende Realitäten](https://www.woz.ch/2540/zwei-jahre-nach-dem-7-oktober/kollidierende-realitaeten/!42Q5MHJSN52K), starting with a [B’Tselem](https://www.btselem.org/) meeting, with quotes from [Yuli Novak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuli_Novak). She says she assumes 95% don’t know about their report, [Our Genocide](https://www.btselem.org/publications/202507_our_genocide).

I see Israelis trying to so the right thing and I am reminded of the time I stood at the Paradeplatz in Zürich during lunch hours, “for a just peace in Palestine.” It was [so long ago](2006-07-15_Electronic_Intifada_has_reports_from_Lebanon). It didn’t help. The vigils are still [ongoing](https://swiss-palestine-network.ch/de/wer-sind-wir/61-mahnwache-zuerich). I no longer go.

Adi Argov from [The Daily File](https://www.thedailyfile.org/) has the last word in the article: “How can the Palestinians forgive what we have done to them? Only our grandchildren might one day know.” (Translation mine.)

Apparently the Israelis are so unaware of what they are doing, so certain of what their friends and family in the army are saying, of what the mainstream media are saying, of what the government is saying, that they can only explain the horror the rest of the world is expressing as anti-semitism. I’m guessing that one day they will say, like so many Germans did: “I did not know!” And they will learn, like the Germans did, that this legacy will be hard to shake. Like I once heard in [an extremely rude voice over for Pingu](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ifh1yx8d83Y): “Fuck you and your entire generation!”

The subtitle of The Daily File is “So that we won’t say we didn’t know.”

If you feel like arguing, please read [Casualties of the Gaza war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Gaza_war), because I’m assuming you’re one of the very people this article is about. It is not my duty to educate you. It is your duty to do the right thing and that includes the duty to educate yourself so that you can do the right thing. Nobody said it was going to be easy.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5">Introducing Claude Haiku 4.5</a></strong></p>
        Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5 today, the cheapest member of the Claude 4.5 family that started with Sonnet 4.5 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/29/claude-sonnet-4-5/">a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>
        <p>It's priced at $1/million input tokens and $5/million output tokens, slightly more expensive than Haiku 3.5 ($0.80/$4) and a <em>lot</em> more expensive than the original Claude 3 Haiku ($0.25/$1.25), both of which remain available at those prices.</p>
        <p>It's a third of the price of Sonnet 4 and Sonnet 4.5 (both $3/$15) which is notable because Anthropic's benchmarks put it in a similar space to that older Sonnet 4 model. As they put it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>What was recently at the frontier is now cheaper and faster. Five months ago, Claude Sonnet 4 was a state-of-the-art model. Today, Claude Haiku 4.5 gives you similar levels of coding performance but at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've been hoping to see Anthropic release a fast, inexpensive model that's price competitive with the cheapest models from OpenAI and Gemini, currently $0.05/$0.40 (GPT-5-Nano) and $0.075/$0.30 (Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite). Haiku 4.5 certainly isn't that, it looks like they're continuing to focus squarely on the "great at code" part of the market.</p>
        <p>The new Haiku is the first Haiku model to support reasoning. It sports a 200,000 token context window, 64,000 maximum output (up from just 8,192 for Haiku 3.5) and a "reliable knowledge cutoff" of February 2025, one month later than the January 2025 date for Sonnet 4 and 4.5 and Opus 4 and 4.1.</p>
        <p>Something that caught my eye in the accompanying <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/99128ddd009bdcb/original/Claude-Haiku-4-5-System-Card.pdf">system card</a> was this note about context length:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>For Claude Haiku 4.5, we trained the model to be explicitly context-aware, with precise information about how much context-window has been used. This has two effects: the model learns when and how to wrap up its answer when the limit is approaching, and the model learns to continue reasoning more persistently when the limit is further away. We found this intervention—along with others—to be effective at limiting agentic “laziness” (the phenomenon where models stop working on a problem prematurely, give incomplete answers, or cut corners on tasks).</p>

      <source:markdown>**[Introducing Claude Haiku 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5)**

Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5 today, the cheapest member of the Claude 4.5 family that started with Sonnet 4.5 [a couple of weeks ago](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/29/claude-sonnet-4-5/).

It&#39;s priced at $1/million input tokens and $5/million output tokens, slightly more expensive than Haiku 3.5 ($0.80/$4) and a _lot_ more expensive than the original Claude 3 Haiku ($0.25/$1.25), both of which remain available at those prices.

It&#39;s a third of the price of Sonnet 4 and Sonnet 4.5 (both $3/$15) which is notable because Anthropic&#39;s benchmarks put it in a similar space to that older Sonnet 4 model. As they put it:

&#62; What was recently at the frontier is now cheaper and faster. Five months ago, Claude Sonnet 4 was a state-of-the-art model. Today, Claude Haiku 4.5 gives you similar levels of coding performance but at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed.

I&#39;ve been hoping to see Anthropic release a fast, inexpensive model that&#39;s price competitive with the cheapest models from OpenAI and Gemini, currently $0.05/$0.40 (GPT-5-Nano) and $0.075/$0.30 (Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite). Haiku 4.5 certainly isn&#39;t that, it looks like they&#39;re continuing to focus squarely on the &#34;great at code&#34; part of the market.

The new Haiku is the first Haiku model to support reasoning. It sports a 200,000 token context window, 64,000 maximum output (up from just 8,192 for Haiku 3.5) and a &#34;reliable knowledge cutoff&#34; of February 2025, one month later than the January 2025 date for Sonnet 4 and 4.5 and Opus 4 and 4.1.

Something that caught my eye in the accompanying [system card](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/99128ddd009bdcb/original/Claude-Haiku-4-5-System-Card.pdf) was this note about context length:

&#62; For Claude Haiku 4.5, we trained the model to be explicitly context-aware, with precise information about how much context-window has been used. This has two effects: the model learns when and how to wrap up its answer when the limit is approaching, and the model learns to continue reasoning more persistently when the limit is further away. We found this intervention—along with others—to be effective at limiting agentic “laziness” (the phenomenon where models stop working on a problem prematurely, give incomplete answers, or cut corners on tasks).

I&#39;ve added the new price to [llm-prices.com](https://www.llm-prices.com/), released [llm-anthropic 0.20](https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.20) with the new model and updated my [Haiku-from-your-webcam](https://tools.simonwillison.net/haiku) demo ( [source](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/haiku.html)) to use Haiku 4.5 as well.

18 input tokens and 1513 output tokens = [0.7583 cents](https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=18&#38;ot=1513&#38;ic=1&#38;oc=5).

      <source:markdown>**[A modern approach to preventing CSRF in Go](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/preventing-csrf-in-go)**

Alex Edwards writes about the new `http.CrossOriginProtection` middleware that was added to the Go standard library in [version 1.25](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.25) in August and asks:

&#62; Have we finally reached the point where CSRF attacks can be prevented without relying on a token-based check (like double-submit cookies)?

It looks like the answer might be _yes_, which is extremely exciting. I&#39;ve been [tracking CSRF](https://simonwillison.net/tags/csrf/) since I first learned about it [20 years ago in May 2005](https://simonwillison.net/2005/May/6/bad/) and a cleaner solution than those janky hidden form fields would be very welcome.

The code for the new Go middleware lives in [src/net/http/csrf.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.25.0/src/net/http/csrf.go). It works using the [Sec-Fetch-Site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site) HTTP header, which Can I Use shows as having [94.18%](https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_sec-fetch-site) global availability - the holdouts are mainly IE11, iOS versions prior to iOS 17 (which came out in 2023 but can be installed on any phone released since 2017) and some other ancient browser versions.

If `Sec-Fetch-Site` is `same-origin` or `none` then the page submitting the form was either on the same origin or was navigated to directly by the user - in both cases safe from CSRF. If it&#39;s `cross-site` or `same-site` ( `tools.simonwillison.net` and `til.simonwillison.net` are considered `same-site` but not `same-origin`) the submission is denied.

If that header isn&#39;t available the middleware falls back on comparing other headers: `Origin` \- a value like `https://simonwillison.net` \- with `Host`, a value like `simonwillison.net`. This should cover the tiny fraction of browsers that don&#39;t have the new header, though it&#39;s not clear to me if there are any weird edge-cases beyond that.

Note that this fallback comparison can&#39;t take the scheme into account since `Host` doesn&#39;t list that, so administrators are encouraged to use [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) to protect against HTTP to HTTPS cross-origin requests.

On Lobste.rs I questioned if this would work for `localhost`, since that normally isn&#39;t served using HTTPS. Firefox security engineer Frederik Braun [reassured me](https://lobste.rs/s/fzw9g7/modern_approach_preventing_csrf_go#c_e24o9q) that `*.localhost` is treated as a Secure Context, so gets the `Sec-Fetch-Site` header despite not being served via HTTPS.

**Update**: Also relevant is [Filippo Valsorda&#39;s article in CSRF](https://words.filippo.io/csrf/) which includes detailed research conducted as part of building the new Go middleware, plus this related [Bluesky conversation](https://bsky.app/profile/filippo.abyssdomain.expert/post/3lmyu7c25zq2o) about that research from six months ago.

        <![CDATA[<p>NVIDIA sent me a preview unit of their new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/">DGX Spark</a> desktop "AI supercomputer". I've never had hardware to review before! You can consider this my first ever sponsored post if you like, but they did not pay me any cash and aside from an embargo date they did not request (nor would I grant) any editorial input into what I write about the device.</p>

        <p>Then switch to the <code>dev</code> user and run Claude for the first time:</p>

        <p>This will provide a URL which you can visit to authenticate with your Anthropic account, confirming by copying back a token and pasting it into the terminal.</p>
        <p>Docker tip: you can create a snapshot of the current image (with Claude installed) by running <code>docker ps</code> to get the container ID and then:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>docker commit --pause=false <span class="pl-k">&lt;</span>container_id<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> cc:snapshot</pre></div>
        <p>Then later you can start a similar container using:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>docker run -it \
          --gpus=all \
          -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro \
          cc:snapshot bash</pre></div>
        <p>Here's an example of the kinds of prompts I've been running in Claude Code inside the container:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>I want to run https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF using llama.cpp - figure out how to get llama cpp working on this machine  such that it runs with the GPU, then install it in this directory and get that model to work to serve a prompt. Goal is to get this  command to run: llama-cli -hf unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF -p "I believe the meaning of life is" -n 128 -no-cnv</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That one worked flawlessly - Claude checked out the <code>llama.cpp</code> repo, compiled it for me and iterated on it until it could run that model on the GPU. Here's a <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3e7d28d9ed222d842f729bfca46d6673">full transcript</a>, converted from Claude's <code>.jsonl</code> log format to Markdown using a script I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/claude_to_markdown.py">vibe coded just now</a>.</p>
        <p>I later told it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Write out a markdown file with detailed notes on what you did. Start with the shortest form of notes on how to get a successful build, then add a full account of everything you tried, what went wrong and how you fixed it.</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Which produced <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0942d96f616b9e328568ab27d911c8ed">this handy set of notes</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="tailscale-was-made-for-this">Tailscale was made for this</h4>
        <p>Having a machine like this on my local network is neat, but what's even neater is being able to access it from anywhere else in the world, from both my phone and my laptop.</p>
        <p><a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> is <em>perfect</em> for this. I installed it on the Spark (using the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1031/install-linux">Ubuntu instructions here</a>), signed in with my SSO account (via Google)... and the Spark showed up in the "Network Devices" panel on my laptop and phone instantly.</p>
        <p>I can SSH in from my laptop or using the <a href="https://termius.com/free-ssh-client-for-iphone">Termius iPhone app</a> on my phone. I've also been running tools like <a href="https://openwebui.com/">Open WebUI</a> which give me a mobile-friendly web interface for interacting with LLMs on the Spark.</p>
        <h4 id="here-comes-the-ecosystem">Here comes the ecosystem</h4>
        <p>The embargo on these devices dropped yesterday afternoon, and it turns out a whole bunch of relevant projects have had similar preview access to myself. This is <em>fantastic news</em> as many of the things I've been trying to figure out myself suddenly got a whole lot easier.</p>
        <p>Four particularly notable examples:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ollama <a href="https://ollama.com/blog/nvidia-spark">works out of the box</a>. They actually had a build that worked a few weeks ago, and were the first success I had running an LLM on the machine.</li>
        <li>
        <code>llama.cpp</code> creator Georgi Gerganov just published  <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/16578">extensive benchmark results</a> from running <code>llama.cpp</code> on a Spark. He's getting ~3,600 tokens/second to read the prompt and ~59 tokens/second to generate a response with the MXFP4 version of GPT-OSS 20B and ~817 tokens/second to read and ~18 tokens/second to generate for GLM-4.5-Air-GGUF.</li>
        <li>LM Studio now have <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/blog/dgx-spark">a build for the Spark</a>. I haven't tried this one yet as I'm currently using my machine exclusively via SSH.</li>
        <li>vLLM - one of the most popular engines for serving production LLMs - had <a href="https://x.com/eqhylxx/status/1977928690945360049">early access</a> and there's now an official <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/vllm?version=25.09-py3">NVIDIA vLLM NGC Container</a> for running their stack.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://docs.unsloth.ai/new/fine-tuning-llms-with-nvidia-dgx-spark-and-unsloth">a tutorial from Unsloth</a> on fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on the Spark.</p>
        <h4 id="should-you-get-one-">Should you get one?</h4>
        <p>It's a bit too early for me to provide a confident recommendation concerning this machine. As indicated above, I've had a tough time figuring out how best to put it to use, largely through my own inexperience with CUDA, ARM64 and Ubuntu GPU machines in general.</p>
        <p>The ecosystem improvements in just the past 24 hours have been very reassuring though. I expect it will be clear within a few weeks how well supported this machine is going to be.</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>NVIDIA sent me a preview unit of their new [DGX Spark](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/) desktop &#34;AI supercomputer&#34;. I&#39;ve never had hardware to review before! You can consider this my first ever sponsored post if you like, but they did not pay me any cash and aside from an embargo date they did not request (nor would I grant) any editorial input into what I write about the device.

The device retails for around $4,000. They officially go on sale tomorrow.

First impressions are that this is a snazzy little computer. It&#39;s similar in size to a Mac mini, but with an exciting textured surface that feels refreshingly different and a little bit [science fiction](https://www.indiewire.com/awards/industry/devs-cinematography-rob-hardy-alex-garland-1234583396/).

![A rectangular small computer, sitting horizontally on a box. It is about the width of a Mac Mini. It has a NVIDIA logo on  a reflective handle portion, then textured silver metal front, then another reflective handle at the other end. It&#39;s pretty and a bit weird looking. It sits on the box it came in, which has NVIDIA DGX Spark written on it in white text on green.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/nvidia-spark.jpg)

There is a _very_ powerful machine tucked into that little box. Here are the specs, which I had Claude Code figure out for me by [poking around on the device itself](https://gist.github.com/simonw/021651a14e6c5bf9876c9c4244ed6c2d):

&#62; **Hardware Specifications**
&#62;
&#62; - Architecture: aarch64 (ARM64)
&#62; - CPU: 20 cores
&#62;   - 10x Cortex-X925 (performance cores)
&#62;   - 10x Cortex-A725 (efficiency cores)
&#62; - RAM: 119 GB total (112 GB available) - _I’m not sure why Claude reported it differently here, the machine is listed as 128GB - it looks like a [128GB == 119GiB thing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45586776#45588329) because Claude [used free -h](https://gist.github.com/simonw/021651a14e6c5bf9876c9c4244ed6c2d#file-nvidia-claude-code-txt-L41)_
&#62; - Storage: 3.7 TB (6% used, 3.3 TB available)
&#62;
&#62; **GPU Specifications**
&#62;
&#62; - Model: NVIDIA GB10 (Blackwell architecture)
&#62; - Compute Capability: sm\_121 (12.1)
&#62; - Memory: 119.68 GB
&#62; - Multi-processor Count: 48 streaming multiprocessors
&#62; - Architecture: Blackwell

Short version: this is an ARM64 device with 128GB of memory that&#39;s available to both the GPU and the 20 CPU cores at the same time, strapped onto a 4TB NVMe SSD.

The Spark is firmly targeted at “AI researchers”. It’s designed for both training and running models.

#### The tricky bit: CUDA on ARM64

Until now almost all of my own model running experiments have taken place on a Mac. This has gotten far less painful over the past year and a half thanks to the amazing work of the [MLX](https://simonwillison.net/tags/mlx/) team and community, but it&#39;s still left me deeply frustrated at my lack of access to the NVIDIA CUDA ecosystem. I&#39;ve lost count of the number of libraries and tutorials which expect you to be able to use Hugging Face Transformers or PyTorch with CUDA, and leave you high and dry if you don&#39;t have an NVIDIA GPU to run things on.

Armed (ha) with my new NVIDIA GPU I was excited to dive into this world that had long eluded me... only to find that there was another assumption baked in to much of this software: x86 architecture for the rest of the machine.

This resulted in all kinds of unexpected new traps for me to navigate. I eventually managed to get a PyTorch 2.7 wheel for CUDA on ARM, but failed to do so for 2.8. I&#39;m not confident there because the wheel itself is unavailable but I&#39;m finding navigating the PyTorch ARM ecosystem pretty confusing.

NVIDIA are trying to make this easier, with mixed success. A lot of my initial challenges got easier when I found their [official Docker container](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-spark/nvidia-container-runtime-for-docker.html), so now I&#39;m figuring out how best to use Docker with GPUs. Here&#39;s the current incantation that&#39;s been working for me:

```
docker run -it --gpus=all \
  -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04 \
  bash
```

I have not yet got my head around the difference between CUDA 12 and 13. 13 appears to be very new, and a lot of the existing tutorials and libraries appear to expect 12.

#### The missing documentation isn&#39;t missing any more

When I first received this machine around a month ago there was very little in the way of documentation to help get me started. This meant climbing the steep NVIDIA+CUDA learning curve mostly on my own.

This has changed _substantially_ in just the last week. NVIDIA now have extensive guides for getting things working on the Spark and they are a huge breath of fresh air - exactly the information I needed when I started exploring this hardware.

Here&#39;s the [getting started guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/topics/ai/dgx-spark), details on the [DGX dashboard web app](https://build.nvidia.com/spark/dgx-dashboard/instructions), and the essential collection of [playbooks](https://build.nvidia.com/spark). There&#39;s still a lot I haven&#39;t tried yet just in this official set of guides.

#### Claude Code for everything

[Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) was an absolute lifesaver for me while I was trying to figure out how best to use this device. My Ubuntu skills were a little rusty, and I also needed to figure out CUDA drivers and Docker incantations and how to install the right versions of PyTorch. Claude 4.5 Sonnet is _much better than me_ at all of these things.

Since many of my experiments took place in disposable Docker containers I had no qualms at all about running it in YOLO mode:

```
IS_SANDBOX=1 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

The `IS_SANDBOX=1` environment variable stops Claude from complaining about running as root.

Before I found out about IS\_SANDBOX

_I was [tipped off](https://twitter.com/lawrencecchen/status/1978255934938886409) about IS\_SANDBOX after I published this article. Here&#39;s my original workaround:_

Claude understandably won&#39;t let you do this as root, even in a Docker container, so I found myself using the following incantation in a fresh `nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04` instance pretty often:

```
apt-get update &#38;&#38; apt-get install -y sudo
# pick the first free UID &#62;=1000
U=$(for i in $(seq 1000 65000); do if ! getent passwd $i &#62;/dev/null; then echo $i; break; fi; done)
echo &#34;Chosen UID: $U&#34;

# Install npm
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive TZ=Etc/UTC apt-get install -y npm
# Install Claude
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then switch to the `dev` user and run Claude for the first time:

```
su - dev
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

This will provide a URL which you can visit to authenticate with your Anthropic account, confirming by copying back a token and pasting it into the terminal.

Docker tip: you can create a snapshot of the current image (with Claude installed) by running `docker ps` to get the container ID and then:

```
docker commit --pause=false &#60;container_id&#62; cc:snapshot
```

Then later you can start a similar container using:

```
docker run -it \
  --gpus=all \
  -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro \
  cc:snapshot bash
```

Here&#39;s an example of the kinds of prompts I&#39;ve been running in Claude Code inside the container:

&#62; `I want to run https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF using llama.cpp - figure out how to get llama cpp working on this machine  such that it runs with the GPU, then install it in this directory and get that model to work to serve a prompt. Goal is to get this  command to run: llama-cli -hf unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF -p &#34;I believe the meaning of life is&#34; -n 128 -no-cnv`

That one worked flawlessly - Claude checked out the `llama.cpp` repo, compiled it for me and iterated on it until it could run that model on the GPU. Here&#39;s a [full transcript](https://gist.github.com/simonw/3e7d28d9ed222d842f729bfca46d6673), converted from Claude&#39;s `.jsonl` log format to Markdown using a script I [vibe coded just now](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/claude_to_markdown.py).

I later told it:

&#62; `Write out a markdown file with detailed notes on what you did. Start with the shortest form of notes on how to get a successful build, then add a full account of everything you tried, what went wrong and how you fixed it.`

Which produced [this handy set of notes](https://gist.github.com/simonw/0942d96f616b9e328568ab27d911c8ed).

#### Tailscale was made for this

Having a machine like this on my local network is neat, but what&#39;s even neater is being able to access it from anywhere else in the world, from both my phone and my laptop.

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is _perfect_ for this. I installed it on the Spark (using the [Ubuntu instructions here](https://tailscale.com/kb/1031/install-linux)), signed in with my SSO account (via Google)... and the Spark showed up in the &#34;Network Devices&#34; panel on my laptop and phone instantly.

I can SSH in from my laptop or using the [Termius iPhone app](https://termius.com/free-ssh-client-for-iphone) on my phone. I&#39;ve also been running tools like [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) which give me a mobile-friendly web interface for interacting with LLMs on the Spark.

#### Here comes the ecosystem

The embargo on these devices dropped yesterday afternoon, and it turns out a whole bunch of relevant projects have had similar preview access to myself. This is _fantastic news_ as many of the things I&#39;ve been trying to figure out myself suddenly got a whole lot easier.

Four particularly notable examples:

- Ollama [works out of the box](https://ollama.com/blog/nvidia-spark). They actually had a build that worked a few weeks ago, and were the first success I had running an LLM on the machine.
- `llama.cpp` creator Georgi Gerganov just published [extensive benchmark results](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/16578) from running `llama.cpp` on a Spark. He&#39;s getting ~3,600 tokens/second to read the prompt and ~59 tokens/second to generate a response with the MXFP4 version of GPT-OSS 20B and ~817 tokens/second to read and ~18 tokens/second to generate for GLM-4.5-Air-GGUF.
- LM Studio now have [a build for the Spark](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/dgx-spark). I haven&#39;t tried this one yet as I&#39;m currently using my machine exclusively via SSH.
- vLLM - one of the most popular engines for serving production LLMs - had [early access](https://x.com/eqhylxx/status/1977928690945360049) and there&#39;s now an official [NVIDIA vLLM NGC Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/vllm?version=25.09-py3) for running their stack.

Here&#39;s [a tutorial from Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/new/fine-tuning-llms-with-nvidia-dgx-spark-and-unsloth) on fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on the Spark.

#### Should you get one?

It&#39;s a bit too early for me to provide a confident recommendation concerning this machine. As indicated above, I&#39;ve had a tough time figuring out how best to put it to use, largely through my own inexperience with CUDA, ARM64 and Ubuntu GPU machines in general.

The ecosystem improvements in just the past 24 hours have been very reassuring though. I expect it will be clear within a few weeks how well supported this machine is going to be.

Peter Steinberger&#39;s long, detailed description of his current process for using Codex CLI and GPT-5 Codex. This is information dense and full of actionable tips, plus plenty of strong opinions about the differences between Claude 4.5 an GPT-5:

&#62; While Claude reacts well to 🚨 SCREAMING ALL-CAPS 🚨 commands that threaten it that it will imply ultimate failure and 100 kittens will die if it runs command X, that freaks out GPT-5. (Rightfully so). So drop all of that and just use words like a human.

Peter is a _heavy_ user of parallel agents:

&#62; I&#39;ve completely moved to `codex` cli as daily driver. I run between 3-8 in parallel in a 3x3 terminal grid, most of them [in the same folder](https://x.com/steipete/status/1977771686176174352), some experiments go in separate folders.

      <source:markdown># 2025-10-14 Israel: So that we won’t say we didn’t know

We are [travelling through Portugal these days](2025-portugal). I brought a bunch of newspapers along – to read should I manage to put down the phone. I just read [Kollidierende Realitäten](https://www.woz.ch/2540/zwei-jahre-nach-dem-7-oktober/kollidierende-realitaeten/!42Q5MHJSN52K), starting with a [B’Tselem](https://www.btselem.org/) meeting, with quotes from [Yuli Novak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuli_Novak). She says she assumes 95% don’t know about their report, [Our Genocide](https://www.btselem.org/publications/202507_our_genocide).

I see Israelis trying to so the right thing and I am reminded of the time I stood at the Paradeplatz during lunch hours, for a Just Peace in Palestine. It was [so long ago](2006-07-15_Electronic_Intifada_has_reports_from_Lebanon). It didn’t help. The vigils are still [ongoing](https://swiss-palestine-network.ch/de/wer-sind-wir/61-mahnwache-zuerich). I no longer go.

Adi Argov from [The Daily File](https://www.thedailyfile.org/) has the last word in the article: “How can the Palestinians forgive what we have done to them? Only our grandchildren might one day know.” (Translation mine.) Apparently the Israelis are so unaware of what they are doing, so certain of what their friends and family in the army are saying, of what the mainstream media are saying, of what the government is saying, that they can only explain the horror the rest of the world is expressing as anti-semitism. I’m guessing that one day they will say, like so many Germans did: “I did not know!” And they will learn, like the Germans did, that this legacy will be hard to shake. Like I once heard in [an extremely rude voice over for Pingu](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ifh1yx8d83Y): “Fuck you and your entire generation!”

The subtitle of The Daily File is “So that we won’t say we didn’t know.”

If you feel like arguing, please read [Casualties of the Gaza war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Gaza_war), because I’m assuming you’re one of the very people this article is about. It is not my duty to educate you. It is your duty to do the right thing and that includes the duty to educate yourself so that you can do the right thing. Nobody said it was going to be easy.

      <title>Times I&#39;ve been ambushed at conferences</title>
      <link>http://scripting.com/2025/10/14/154258.html?title=timesIveBeenAmbushedAtConferences</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Well, I think I'm done. I've got the outline for the slides complete. I can't possibly talk about all the stuff that's in the slides. Once I leave tomorrow I think perhaps I'll post a link for the slides and maybe offer a place to comment. Maybe. </p>
        <p>I get very nervous about these things and then remember when I've prepared as much as I have for this, the talk goes quickly and people generally are nice, though I've been ambushed a few memorable times. Let's see -- Austin, Cambridge, San Francisco and Nashville come to mind. ;-)</p>
        <p>In Austin it was because I was privileged. I was being honored because it was the 25th year of my blog, and I was one of the keynoters. I told the promoter his people wouldn't like me, and then I forgot I said it when it happened. I was stuck, I didn't want to get into a public argument with anyone. (Had I wanted to rebut, I would have said everyone in this room is privileged, just look around at how well fed and educated everyone is. We all flew in here. We live in a rich country where we are the elite of the elite. Now STFU, in my dreams.) </p>
        <p>There have been times when I welcomed an argument...</p>
        <p>In San Francisco, I was invited to lead a panel from the music industry about how great Napster was. This was probably in 2000 or 2001 when Napster was at its peak. It was an ambush. All the panelists made me the issue, and then they voted to kick me off the stage. I stayed there and waited until they exhausted their rage, and then asked them a question about music and Napster. Acted like nothing had happened. I had earned my place there, I was a very early industry adopter of Napster. I loved what it did for us. Imagine until then you either had to buy an album to listen to music, build a collection, or wait until it was played on the radio. (What is radio? Kind of an early form of podcasting.) People were talking about music in supermarkets and airports. This could not be stopped, I was sure of it, and they were acting like babies. I stood up and prevailed.</p>
        <p>In Nashville, I was invited to be a sort of keynoter for a conference that was patterned after BloggerCon. I did not organize it, but I led a session, which was attended by a famous right wing blogger who I had invited to the Harvard BloggerCon. He brought a bunch of his friends, and they each said no one was listening to them but we were listening to them. I eventually sat down and let them have a session dominated by a few people repeating themselves. It was boring. </p>
        <p>Finally I was set up by the promoters of a CMS conference which Berkman hosted at Harvard. I was the master of ceremonies. No one told me that one of my most virulent trolls was there, and when he got up to rage at me I asked him to sit down, but Charlie Nesson who was the senior educator there, and kind of naive about internet trolls, said he should speak his mind. I should have walked out at that point. I knew what was coming. It really shook me. </p>
        <p>In Nashville a columnist in a local paper who said I caused the riot, btw. I swear to god I always take my discussion leader role seriously. I gave them all a chance to talk and they all said the same thing, almost as if they had been told to say it. </p>]]>

The explains _a lot_ about React-driven front-end development!

        <p>Towards the end, <a href="https://noti.st/tkadlec/gIzxEG#s6xk0Z2">there’s a slide</a> that could be the tagline for <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a>:</p>

        <p>Most of the talk focuses on two technologies that you can add to any website with just a couple of lines of code: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API">view transitions</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API">speculation rules</a>.</p>

        <p>Honestly, that takes care of 95% of the reasons for building a single-page app (the other 5% would be around managing state, which most sites—e-commerce, publishing, whatever—don’t need to bother with).

        <p>I mean, why <em>wouldn’t</em> you do that?</p>
        
        <p>That’s not a rhetorical question. I’m genuinely interested in the reasons why people would reject a simple declarative solution in favour of the complexity of doing everything with a big JavaScript framework.</p>
        
        <p>One reason might be browser support. After all, both view transitions and speculation rules are designed to be used as progressive enhancements, regardless of how many browsers happen to support them right now.

Towards the end, [there’s a slide](https://noti.st/tkadlec/gIzxEG#s6xk0Z2) that could be the tagline for [Web Day Out](https://webdayout.com/):

&#62; Betting on the browser is our best chance at long-term success.

Honestly, that takes care of 95% of the reasons for building a single-page app (the other 5% would be around managing state, which most sites—e-commerce, publishing, whatever—don’t need to bother with). Instead build a good ol’-fashioned website with pages of HTML linked together, then apply view transitions and speculation rules.

I mean, why _wouldn’t_ you do that?

That’s not a rhetorical question. I’m genuinely interested in the reasons why people would reject a simple declarative solution in favour of the complexity of doing everything with a big JavaScript framework.

One reason might be browser support. After all, both view transitions and speculation rules are designed to be used as progressive enhancements, regardless of how many browsers happen to support them right now. If you want to attempt to have complete control, I understand why you might reach for the single-page app model, even if it means bloating the initial payload.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat">nanochat</a></strong></p>
        Really interesting new project from Andrej Karpathy, described at length <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/1">in this discussion post</a>.</p>
        <p>It provides a full ChatGPT-style LLM, including training, inference and a web Ui, that can be trained for as little as $100:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>This repo is a full-stack implementation of an LLM like ChatGPT in a single, clean, minimal, hackable, dependency-lite codebase.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's around 8,000 lines of code, mostly Python (using PyTorch) plus a little bit of Rust for <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/tree/master/rustbpe">training the tokenizer</a>.</p>
        <p>Andrej suggests renting a 8XH100 NVIDA node for around $24/ hour to train the model. 4 hours (~$100) is enough to get a model that can hold a conversation - <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1977755430093980034">almost coherent example here</a>. Run it for 12 hours and you get something that slightly outperforms GPT-2. I'm looking forward to hearing results from longer training runs!</p>
        <p>The resulting model is ~561M parameters, so it should run on almost anything. I've run a 4B model on my iPhone, 561M should easily fit on even an inexpensive Raspberry Pi.</p>
        <p>The model defaults to training on ~24GB from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/karpathy/fineweb-edu-100b-shuffle">karpathy/fineweb-edu-100b-shuffle</a> derived from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu">FineWeb-Edu</a>, and then <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/blob/5fd0b138860a76beb60cf099fa46f74191b50941/scripts/mid_train.py">midtrains</a> on 568K examples from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/smol-smoltalk">SmolTalk</a> (460K), <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/mmlu">MMLU auxiliary train</a> (100K), and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k">GSM8K</a> (8K), followed by <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/blob/5fd0b138860a76beb60cf099fa46f74191b50941/scripts/chat_sft.py">supervised finetuning</a> on 21.4K examples from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc#arc-easy-1">ARC-Easy</a> (2.3K), <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc#arc-challenge">ARC-Challenge</a> (1.1K), <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k">GSM8K</a> (8K), and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/smol-smoltalk">SmolTalk</a> (10K).</p>

        <p><strong>Update</strong>: Sam Dobson pushed a build of the model to <a href="https://huggingface.co/sdobson/nanochat">sdobson/nanochat</a> on Hugging Face. It's designed to run on CUDA but I pointed Claude Code at a checkout and had it hack around until it figured out how to run it on CPU on macOS, which eventually resulted in <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/912623bf00d6c13cc0211508969a100a">this script</a> which I've published as a Gist.

      <source:markdown>From Code to Control: How Big Tech Claims Ownership of the User

September 2025 has been a brutal reminder of a truth we at Purism have been voicing for years: code is power. And when that code is closed, opaque, or controlled by Big Tech vendors who prioritize convenience or monetization over user rights, the end-user becomes the product, not the principal.

      <source:markdown>Let&#39;s remember how the web could have worked.

The ideal is to write in our blog space, and publish everywhere.

That&#39;s what we have been trying to do since Twitter came along.

Write on your main blog, cross-post everywhere it belongs.

This could have worked, and it still can.

But it can&#39;t work until we get agreement on what text is. This will be much-discussed at [WordCamp Canada](https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/) this week, based on what [WordPress is doing](https://wordpress.com/plugins/activitypub) and what [Evan Prodromou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Prodromou) will speak about and of course what I am speaking about.

Getting back on track is as simple as agreeing what text is on the web. For that we have two very good models: HTML and Markdown.

      <title>The killer feature of Web Components</title>
      <link>https://daverupert.com/2025/10/custom-elements-manifest-killer-feature/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/cem.png" alt="A left right flow chart starting at Add JSDoc pointing to CEM analyze then branching off into 8 different directions: API documentation, Storybook, Language Server, Linter, React Wrappers, More Wrappers, Jest Mocks, JSX Types, Figma Code Connect, and MCP Server" width="784" height="430">
        <p>One unsung feature in the web components space that I don’t think gets enough attention is the <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest">Custom Elements Manifest</a> initiative. I think it’s the killer feature of web components.</p>
        <p>Known as “CEM” to its friends, a CEM is a community standard JSON format that surfaces information about your component APIs. <a href="https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/getting-started/">The analyzer</a> scans your class-based component to build up a “manifest” of all the methods, events, slots, parts, tag name, and CSS variables you want to expose. It works on a single component or an entire system’s worth of components. If you want to surface more details to consumers (like accepted attributes or CSS custom properties), you can provide more context to the analyzer through JSDoc comments and/or TypeScript types – which is good code hygiene and a favor for your future self anyhow. Here’s an example from <a href="https://custom-elements-manifest.netlify.app/">the playground</a>:</p>
        <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="js"><span class="cm">/**
         * @attr {boolean} disabled - disables the element
         * @attribute {string} foo - description for foo
         *
         * @csspart bar - Styles the color of bar
         *
         * @slot - This is a default/unnamed slot
         * @slot container - You can put some elements here
         *
         * @cssprop --text-color - Controls the color of foo
         * @cssproperty [--background-color=red] - Controls the color of bar
         *
         * @prop {boolean} prop1 - some description
         * @property {number} prop2 - some description
         *
         * @fires custom-event - some description for custom-event
         * @fires {Event} typed-event - some description for typed-event
         * @event {CustomEvent} typed-custom-event - some description for typed-custom-event
         *
         * @summary This is MyElement
         *
         * @tag my-element
         * @tagname my-element
         */</span>
        <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">MyElement</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nc">HTMLElement</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
        </code></pre></div></div>
        <p>The JSDoc notation is forgiving (it supports both <code>@cssprop</code> and <code>@cssproperty</code>) and with the ability to document your <code>::part()</code> and <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> APIs, it’s more descriptive than what you’d get with a basic TypeScript interface. Eagle-eyed observers will notice there’s a distinction made between an <code>@attribute</code> and an <code>@property</code>, that’s because those are different concepts in HTML, <em>ergo</em> different in Custom Elements. Attributes (strings, numbers, booleans) tend to reflect, properties don’t.</p>
        <p>After that thin layer of documentation, it’s a two-liner to generate the manifest:</p>
        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm i -D @custom-elements-manifest/analyzer
        cem analyze
        </code></pre></div></div>
        <p>This will generate a file called <code>custom-elements.json</code> in your package directory.</p>
        <details style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.875rem;">

        <p>API extraction through TypeScript or JSDoc isn’t a novel concept, but what I find novel is the community tooling built around it. With a Custom Element Manifest, <a href="https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/plugins/intro/">community plugins</a> can use that information to generate files, populate dropdowns, <mark style="background: transparent; color: inherit; text-decoration: var(--accent, red) underline wavy; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; text-underline-offset: 4px;">add red squiggles</mark>, provide autocomplete, and automate a lot of the mundane meta-system DX work that comes with supporting a component library:</p>

        <li><a href="https://wc-toolkit.com/integrations/storybook/">Storybook</a> - Using the Storybook plugin you can use your CEM to automate the generation of your Storybook stories.</li>
        <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wc-toolkit.web-components-language-server">Language Servers</a> - It can be frustrating to not have your editor recognize the HTML you invented.

        <li><a href="https://wc-toolkit.com/integrations/wctools/">Linter</a> - Want to lint HTML before shipping? CEM can power this.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-react-wrappers">React Wrappers</a> - React 19 supports web components, but if you’re trying to use web components in a React &lt;= 18 project, you’ll need little wrapper shims. Creating these by hand isn’t fun and we can hand this work off to the CEM.</li>
        <li>Other Framework Wrappers - Shims for <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-solidjs-integration">SolidJS</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-svelte-integration">Svelte</a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-vuejs-integration">Vue.js</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-jsx-integration">JSX Types</a> - JSX isn’t happy unless you add new interfaces to the JSX namespace. CEM can generate this for you.</li>
        <li>Jest Mocks - If you’re still using Jest in <span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps;">the year of our lord 2025</span>, I feel bad for you but there are plenty of people in this situation. Jest hates Custom Elements because Custom Elements are real DOM and not VDOM. No plugin to link to (sorry!) but I have seen teams using CEM to generate Jest mocks to smooth over the process when integrating with legacy testing solutions.</li>
        <li><a href="https://jamesiv.es/blog/frontend/javascript/2025/09/21/custom-elements-manifest-and-figma-code-connect">Figma Code Connect</a> - If you want to connect your web components to Figma, you can automate that as well.</li>
        <li><a href="https://bennypowers.dev/cem/docs/mcp/">MCP Server</a> - If you want to give your AI Agents insights into the components available in the current project, you can install an MCP Server that parses your CEM.

        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/break-stuff">Burton Smith</a> who runs <a href="https://wc-toolkit.com/">WC Toolkit</a> has been helping us roll out some of our CEM work and we’re starting to turn some of these capabilities on. One pain point I’m hoping to solve is too much boilerplate. We have a lot of files in our individual component packages to power assorted tasks and integrations and I can see a world where we generate nearly all our readmes, storybooks, and even some low-level test coverage from the CEM at build-time or run-time.</p>
        <p>From a single file we get the following outcomes…</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Spend less time/energy maintaining and schlepping boilerplate code</li>
        <li>Improve baseline test coverage and make it more predictable</li>
        <li>Make new components easier to create, ideally speeding up development</li>
        <li>Reduce cognitive overhead when jumping into the project</li>
        <li>Provide a forcing function for more/better documentation</li>
        <li>Potentially improve the design-developer bridge through Figma Code Connect and MCPs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Again, I want to applaud the web components community here. There’s no VC-funded corporate overlord roadmap driving the Custom Elements Manifest initiative, just fellow enthusiasts. From a community perspective, that’s a positive signal for me. Adding it to your project is low-effort, high-impact type work and I probably only covered about a quarter of what a CEM can do for you, which goes to show a community agreeing on a standardized way to describe components is a powerful tool.</p>]]>

One unsung feature in the web components space that I don’t think gets enough attention is the [Custom Elements Manifest](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest) initiative. I think it’s the killer feature of web components.

Known as “CEM” to its friends, a CEM is a community standard JSON format that surfaces information about your component APIs. [The analyzer](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/getting-started/) scans your class-based component to build up a “manifest” of all the methods, events, slots, parts, tag name, and CSS variables you want to expose. It works on a single component or an entire system’s worth of components. If you want to surface more details to consumers (like accepted attributes or CSS custom properties), you can provide more context to the analyzer through JSDoc comments and/or TypeScript types – which is good code hygiene and a favor for your future self anyhow. Here’s an example from [the playground](https://custom-elements-manifest.netlify.app/):

```
/**
 * @attr {boolean} disabled - disables the element
 * @attribute {string} foo - description for foo
 *
 * @csspart bar - Styles the color of bar
 *
 * @slot - This is a default/unnamed slot
 * @slot container - You can put some elements here
 *
 * @cssprop --text-color - Controls the color of foo
 * @cssproperty [--background-color=red] - Controls the color of bar
 *
 * @prop {boolean} prop1 - some description
 * @property {number} prop2 - some description
 *
 * @fires custom-event - some description for custom-event
 * @fires {Event} typed-event - some description for typed-event
 * @event {CustomEvent} typed-custom-event - some description for typed-custom-event
 *
 * @summary This is MyElement
 *
 * @tag my-element
 * @tagname my-element
 */
class MyElement extends HTMLElement {}

```

The JSDoc notation is forgiving (it supports both `@cssprop` and `@cssproperty`) and with the ability to document your `::part()` and `&#60;slot&#62;` APIs, it’s more descriptive than what you’d get with a basic TypeScript interface. Eagle-eyed observers will notice there’s a distinction made between an `@attribute` and an `@property`, that’s because those are different concepts in HTML, _ergo_ different in Custom Elements. Attributes (strings, numbers, booleans) tend to reflect, properties don’t.

After that thin layer of documentation, it’s a two-liner to generate the manifest:

```
npm i -D @custom-elements-manifest/analyzer
cem analyze

```

This will generate a file called `custom-elements.json` in your package directory.

API extraction through TypeScript or JSDoc isn’t a novel concept, but what I find novel is the community tooling built around it. With a Custom Element Manifest, [community plugins](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/plugins/intro/) can use that information to generate files, populate dropdowns, add red squiggles, provide autocomplete, and automate a lot of the mundane meta-system DX work that comes with supporting a component library:

- [API Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@custom-elements-manifest/to-markdown) \- Your CEM can power your readme.md and component-level documentation.
- [Storybook](https://wc-toolkit.com/integrations/storybook/) \- Using the Storybook plugin you can use your CEM to automate the generation of your Storybook stories.
- [Language Servers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wc-toolkit.web-components-language-server) \- It can be frustrating to not have your editor recognize the HTML you invented. CEM-powered language servers solve that issue. A [few](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pwrs.cem-language-server-vscode) [options](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Matsuuu.custom-elements-language-server-project) [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wc-toolkit.web-components-language-server).
- [Linter](https://wc-toolkit.com/integrations/wctools/) \- Want to lint HTML before shipping? CEM can power this.
- [React Wrappers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-react-wrappers) \- React 19 supports web components, but if you’re trying to use web components in a React &#60;= 18 project, you’ll need little wrapper shims. Creating these by hand isn’t fun and we can hand this work off to the CEM.
- Other Framework Wrappers - Shims for [SolidJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-solidjs-integration), [Svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-svelte-integration), and [Vue.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-vuejs-integration).
- [JSX Types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-element-jsx-integration) \- JSX isn’t happy unless you add new interfaces to the JSX namespace. CEM can generate this for you.
- Jest Mocks - If you’re still using Jest in the year of our lord 2025, I feel bad for you but there are plenty of people in this situation. Jest hates Custom Elements because Custom Elements are real DOM and not VDOM. No plugin to link to (sorry!) but I have seen teams using CEM to generate Jest mocks to smooth over the process when integrating with legacy testing solutions.
- [Figma Code Connect](https://jamesiv.es/blog/frontend/javascript/2025/09/21/custom-elements-manifest-and-figma-code-connect) \- If you want to connect your web components to Figma, you can automate that as well.
- [MCP Server](https://bennypowers.dev/cem/docs/mcp/) \- If you want to give your AI Agents insights into the components available in the current project, you can install an MCP Server that parses your CEM. ( [Couple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=d13.vscode-web-components-ai) [options](https://bennypowers.dev/cem/docs/mcp/) here)

[Burton Smith](https://github.com/break-stuff) who runs [WC Toolkit](https://wc-toolkit.com/) has been helping us roll out some of our CEM work and we’re starting to turn some of these capabilities on. One pain point I’m hoping to solve is too much boilerplate. We have a lot of files in our individual component packages to power assorted tasks and integrations and I can see a world where we generate nearly all our readmes, storybooks, and even some low-level test coverage from the CEM at build-time or run-time.

From a single file we get the following outcomes…

- Spend less time/energy maintaining and schlepping boilerplate code
- Improve baseline test coverage and make it more predictable
- Make new components easier to create, ideally speeding up development
- Reduce cognitive overhead when jumping into the project
- Provide a forcing function for more/better documentation
- Potentially improve the design-developer bridge through Figma Code Connect and MCPs

Again, I want to applaud the web components community here. There’s no VC-funded corporate overlord roadmap driving the Custom Elements Manifest initiative, just fellow enthusiasts. From a community perspective, that’s a positive signal for me. Adding it to your project is low-effort, high-impact type work and I probably only covered about a quarter of what a CEM can do for you, which goes to show a community agreeing on a standardized way to describe components is a powerful tool.</source:markdown>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Claude Code includes the ability to run sub-agents, where a separate agent loop with a fresh token context is dispatched to achieve a goal and report back when it's done. I wrote a bit about how these work <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/2/claude-trace/">in June</a> when I traced Claude Code's activity by intercepting its API calls.</p>
        <p>I recently learned that you can <em>deliberately</em> trigger Claude Code to use sub-agents just by telling it to do so!</p>
        <p>Here's an example. I ran this using Claude Code against a fresh checkout of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">simonw/datasette</a> (commit <code>ec38ad37689f3c14d307770977a17aed5efc5cb9</code>), with no additional custom instructions:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Write markdown documentation for the context passed to each of the templates in this project. Use sub-agents.</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here's a snippet of the output:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>⏺ I'll help you write markdown documentation for the context passed to each template in this project. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the template structure and then use sub-agents to document them comprehensively.</p>

        <p>⏺ Now let me launch sub-agents to analyze different template contexts in parallel:</p>

      <source:markdown>Claude Code includes the ability to run sub-agents, where a separate agent loop with a fresh token context is dispatched to achieve a goal and report back when it&#39;s done. I wrote a bit about how these work [in June](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/2/claude-trace/) when I traced Claude Code&#39;s activity by intercepting its API calls.

I recently learned that you can _deliberately_ trigger Claude Code to use sub-agents just by telling it to do so!

Here&#39;s an example. I ran this using Claude Code against a fresh checkout of [simonw/datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette) (commit `ec38ad37689f3c14d307770977a17aed5efc5cb9`), with no additional custom instructions:

&#62; `Write markdown documentation for the context passed to each of the templates in this project. Use sub-agents.`

Here&#39;s a snippet of the output:

&#62; ⏺ I&#39;ll help you write markdown documentation for the context passed to each template in this project. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the template structure and then use sub-agents to document them comprehensively.

&#62;
&#62; ⏺ Now let me launch sub-agents to analyze different template contexts in parallel:

&#62;   ⎿  Done (26 tool uses · 116.1k tokens · 1m 50s)
&#62;
&#62; ```

It churned away for a couple of minutes (those sub-agents execute in parallel, another benefit of this pattern) and made me this [template\_contexts.md](https://gist.github.com/simonw/5b7d87fe5ffa36e7a4c104fcb18fc097) markdown file. It&#39;s very comprehensive.

      <title>Vibing a Non-Trivial Ghostty Feature</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/11/vibing-a-non-trivial-ghostty-feature/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing">Vibing a Non-Trivial Ghostty Feature</a></strong></p>
        Mitchell Hashimoto provides a comprehensive answer to the <em>frequent</em> demand for a detailed description of shipping a non-trivial production feature to an existing project using AI-assistance. In this case it's a slick unobtrusive auto-update UI for his <a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> terminal emulator, written in Swift.</p>
        <p>Mitchell shares full transcripts of the 16 coding sessions he carried out using <a href="https://ampcode.com/">Amp Code</a> across 2 days and around 8 hours of computer time, at a token cost of $15.98.</p>
        <p>Amp has the nicest shared transcript feature of any of the coding agent tools, as seen <a href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-9fc3eb88-5aa2-45e4-8f6d-03697f53102d">in this example</a>. I'd love to see Claude Code and Codex CLI and Gemini CLI and friends imitate this.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of useful tips in here. I like this note about the importance of a cleanup step:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The cleanup step is really important. To cleanup effectively you have to have a pretty good understanding of the code, so this forces me to not blindly accept AI-written code. Subsequently, better organized and documented code helps future agentic sessions perform better.</p>
        <p>I sometimes tongue-in-cheek refer to this as the "anti-slop session".</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And this on how sometimes you can write manual code in a way that puts the agent the right track:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I spent some time manually restructured the view model. This involved switching to a tagged union rather than the struct with a bunch of optionals. I renamed some types, moved stuff around.</p>
        <p>I knew from experience that this small bit of manual work in the middle would set the agents up for success in future sessions for both the frontend and backend. After completing it, I continued with a marathon set of cleanup sessions.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here's one of those refactoring prompts:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Turn each @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdatePopoverView.swift case into a dedicated fileprivate Swift view that takes the typed value as its parameter so that we can remove the guards.</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Mitchell advises ending every session with a prompt like this one, asking the agent about any obvious omissions:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Are there any other improvements you can see to be made with the @macos/Sources/Features/Update feature? Don't write any code. Consult the oracle. Consider parts of the code that can also get more unit tests added.</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>("Consult the oracle" is an Amp-specific pattern for running a task through a more expensive, more capable model.)</p>
        <p>Is this all worthwhile? Mitchell thinks so:</p>
        <blockquote>

      <source:markdown>**[Vibing a Non-Trivial Ghostty Feature](https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing)**

Mitchell Hashimoto provides a comprehensive answer to the _frequent_ demand for a detailed description of shipping a non-trivial production feature to an existing project using AI-assistance. In this case it&#39;s a slick unobtrusive auto-update UI for his [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) terminal emulator, written in Swift.

Mitchell shares full transcripts of the 16 coding sessions he carried out using [Amp Code](https://ampcode.com/) across 2 days and around 8 hours of computer time, at a token cost of $15.98.

Amp has the nicest shared transcript feature of any of the coding agent tools, as seen [in this example](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-9fc3eb88-5aa2-45e4-8f6d-03697f53102d). I&#39;d love to see Claude Code and Codex CLI and Gemini CLI and friends imitate this.

There are plenty of useful tips in here. I like this note about the importance of a cleanup step:

&#62; The cleanup step is really important. To cleanup effectively you have to have a pretty good understanding of the code, so this forces me to not blindly accept AI-written code. Subsequently, better organized and documented code helps future agentic sessions perform better.
&#62;
&#62; I sometimes tongue-in-cheek refer to this as the &#34;anti-slop session&#34;.

And this on how sometimes you can write manual code in a way that puts the agent the right track:

&#62; I spent some time manually restructured the view model. This involved switching to a tagged union rather than the struct with a bunch of optionals. I renamed some types, moved stuff around.
&#62;
&#62; I knew from experience that this small bit of manual work in the middle would set the agents up for success in future sessions for both the frontend and backend. After completing it, I continued with a marathon set of cleanup sessions.

Here&#39;s one of those refactoring prompts:

&#62; `Turn each @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdatePopoverView.swift case into a dedicated fileprivate Swift view that takes the typed value as its parameter so that we can remove the guards.`

Mitchell advises ending every session with a prompt like this one, asking the agent about any obvious omissions:

&#62; `Are there any other improvements you can see to be made with the @macos/Sources/Features/Update feature? Don&#39;t write any code. Consult the oracle. Consider parts of the code that can also get more unit tests added.`

(&#34;Consult the oracle&#34; is an Amp-specific pattern for running a task through a more expensive, more capable model.)

Is this all worthwhile? Mitchell thinks so:

&#62; Many people on the internet argue whether AI enables you to work faster or not. In this case, I think I shipped this faster than I would have if I had done it all myself, in particular because iterating on minor SwiftUI styling is so tedious and time consuming for me personally and AI does it so well.
&#62;
&#62; I think the faster/slower argument for me personally is missing the thing I like the most: the AI can work for me while I step away to do other things.

Here&#39;s [the resulting PR](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/9116/files), which touches 21 files.

      <source:markdown>Suppose somebody is using a blade. Perhaps they’re in the bathroom, shaving. Or maybe they’re in the kitchen, preparing food.

Suppose they cut themselves with that blade. This might have happened because the blade was too sharp. Or perhaps the blade was too dull.

Either way, it’s going to be tricky to figure out the reason just by looking at the wound.

But if you talk to the person, not only will you find out the reason, you’ll also understand their pain.</source:markdown>

        s3's support for conditional writes (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/26/s3-conditional-writes/">previously</a>) makes it an interesting, scalable and often inexpensive platform for all kinds of database patterns.</p>

      <source:markdown>**[An MVCC-like columnar table on S3 with constant-time deletes](https://www.shayon.dev/post/2025/277/an-mvcc-like-columnar-table-on-s3-with-constant-time-deletes/)**

s3&#39;s support for conditional writes ( [previously](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/26/s3-conditional-writes/)) makes it an interesting, scalable and often inexpensive platform for all kinds of database patterns.

Shayon Mukherjee presents an ingenious design for a Parquet-backed database in S3 which accepts concurrent writes, presents a single atomic view for readers and even supports reliable row deletion despite Parquet requiring a complete file rewrite in order to remove data.

The key to the design is a `_latest_manifest` JSON file at the top of the bucket, containing an integer version number. Clients use compare-and-swap to increment that version - only one client can succeed at this, so the incremented version they get back is guaranteed unique to them.

Having reserved a version number the client can write a unique manifest file for that version - `manifest/v00000123.json` \- with a more complex data structure referencing the current versions of every persisted file, including the one they just uploaded.

Deleted rows are written to tombstone files as either a list of primary keys or a list of of ranges. Clients consult these when executing reads, filtering out deleted rows as part of resolving a query.

The pricing estimates are especially noteworthy:

&#62; For a workload ingesting 6 TB/day with 2 TB of deletes and 50K queries/day:
&#62;
&#62; - PUT requests: ~380K/day (≈4 req/s) = $1.88/day
&#62; - GET requests: highly variable, depends on partitioning effectiveness
&#62;   - Best case (good time-based partitioning): ~100K-200K/day = $0.04-$0.08/day
&#62;   - Worst case (poor partitioning, scanning many files): ~2M/day = $0.80/day

~$3/day for ingesting 6TB of data is pretty fantastic!

Watch out for storage costs though - each new TB of data at $0.023/GB/month adds $23.55 to the ongoing monthly bill.

      <title>How to tame a user interface using a spreadsheet</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Many years ago, while working at Apple and running a lab at WWDC, I met a guy who was using a piece of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAd_Producer">Apple software designed for creating interactive ads</a> to design a Car Play user interface for a popular US car manufacturer. I was impressed by his ability to think outside the box and told him so. I mentioned to him how human interface designers at Apple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGn7BcFGigc&amp;t=474s">were using Keynote to rapidly prototype user interfaces and animations</a>. The discussion then took a strange turn onto spreadsheets.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <h2 id="spreadsheets">Spreadsheets?</h2>
        
        <p>In my opinion, spreadsheets are one of the greatest user interface design tools ever created. I believe that the most effective tool for a job is one that gets out of the way as much as possible. Even better if it’s a tool that you already have access to, or at the very least, can use at no cost.</p>
        
        <p>Before you have time to load up Figma, Sketch, Photoshop, or any other design software, I’ll have already typed in my content placeholders in a spreadsheet and be most of my way towards a solution. I’ll be merging and moving cells at lightning speed—rationalising layouts, determining the optimal use of space, and creating order out of chaos.</p>
        
        <p>The purpose of using a tool that may seem ill-suited to the task at hand—designing user interfaces—is to liberate yourself from the clutter or baggage of content and style. This allows you to focus solely on layout, positioning, and hierarchy. You don’t have to worry about type sizes, or get bogged down with software choices. You can quickly adjust the size or structure of the screen by adding/removing rows/columns. With a spreadsheet, it’s just the keyboard between you and the perfect layout.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <h2 id="lets-take-your-brain-to-another-dimension">Let’s take your brain to another dimension</h2>
        
        <p>One frequent criticism of spreadsheets is that they are “only 2D” or that a grid isn’t versatile enough to solve your problem. But if you pay close attention, you’ll realise that spreadsheets can occupy as many dimensions as you require by using multiple sheets. Like the stack of ledger paper that was used before spreadsheets were invented. An episode of The Computer Chronicles called “The Spreadsheet Wars” aired in 1988 and has a great <a href="https://youtu.be/eAiZBUYNUBA?si=TMiXXLj1gtFwZQkp&amp;t=1154">demo of spreadsheet software Lotus 1-2-3 doing 3D spreadsheet manipulation</a> in ways that are still impressive several decades later.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/GridSystemsInGraphicDesignJosefMullerBrockmann">Grid systems are well known across many fields of design</a> for being a huge assist when solving layouts and rationalising problems. The grid enforces structure invisibly during the design process. A spreadsheet is a highly configurable grid system that is ready to be put to work on your problem!</p>
        
        <p>You might also consider the use of plain paper, graph paper, and a bitmap editor. Which might be best suited for sketching out a quick icon idea? It’s easy to understand that graph paper is more suitable than plain paper for drawing images made up of pixels, and in many situations it may be quicker and more suitable than a bitmap editor. <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/188382?artist_id=38483&amp;page=1&amp;sov_referrer=artist">Susan Kare famously used a book of grid/graph paper to draw many early Macintosh icons</a> because icon creation software had yet to be invented.</p>

      <source:markdown>Many years ago, while working at Apple and running a lab at WWDC, I met a guy who was using a piece of [Apple software designed for creating interactive ads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAd_Producer) to design a Car Play user interface for a popular US car manufacturer. I was impressed by his ability to think outside the box and told him so. I mentioned to him how human interface designers at Apple [were using Keynote to rapidly prototype user interfaces and animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGn7BcFGigc&#38;t=474s). The discussion then took a strange turn onto spreadsheets.

## Spreadsheets?

In my opinion, spreadsheets are one of the greatest user interface design tools ever created. I believe that the most effective tool for a job is one that gets out of the way as much as possible. Even better if it’s a tool that you already have access to, or at the very least, can use at no cost.

Before you have time to load up Figma, Sketch, Photoshop, or any other design software, I’ll have already typed in my content placeholders in a spreadsheet and be most of my way towards a solution. I’ll be merging and moving cells at lightning speed—rationalising layouts, determining the optimal use of space, and creating order out of chaos.

The purpose of using a tool that may seem ill-suited to the task at hand—designing user interfaces—is to liberate yourself from the clutter or baggage of content and style. This allows you to focus solely on layout, positioning, and hierarchy. You don’t have to worry about type sizes, or get bogged down with software choices. You can quickly adjust the size or structure of the screen by adding/removing rows/columns. With a spreadsheet, it’s just the keyboard between you and the perfect layout.

## Let’s take your brain to another dimension

One frequent criticism of spreadsheets is that they are “only 2D” or that a grid isn’t versatile enough to solve your problem. But if you pay close attention, you’ll realise that spreadsheets can occupy as many dimensions as you require by using multiple sheets. Like the stack of ledger paper that was used before spreadsheets were invented. An episode of The Computer Chronicles called “The Spreadsheet Wars” aired in 1988 and has a great [demo of spreadsheet software Lotus 1-2-3 doing 3D spreadsheet manipulation](https://youtu.be/eAiZBUYNUBA?si=TMiXXLj1gtFwZQkp&#38;t=1154) in ways that are still impressive several decades later.

[Grid systems are well known across many fields of design](https://archive.org/details/GridSystemsInGraphicDesignJosefMullerBrockmann) for being a huge assist when solving layouts and rationalising problems. The grid enforces structure invisibly during the design process. A spreadsheet is a highly configurable grid system that is ready to be put to work on your problem!

You might also consider the use of plain paper, graph paper, and a bitmap editor. Which might be best suited for sketching out a quick icon idea? It’s easy to understand that graph paper is more suitable than plain paper for drawing images made up of pixels, and in many situations it may be quicker and more suitable than a bitmap editor. [Susan Kare famously used a book of grid/graph paper to draw many early Macintosh icons](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/188382?artist_id=38483&#38;page=1&#38;sov_referrer=artist) because icon creation software had yet to be invented.

## There’s an app for that

I use Apple Numbers to do most of my spreadsheet work, because it’s the one that I have easiest access to most of the time—it’s installed on both my Mac and iPhone. You might want to use Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or even a simpler table tool like [SmoothCSV](https://smoothcsv.com). There is no wrong choice.

Here are some examples of layouts I’ve solved using a spreadsheet.

## YOYOZO

Perhaps my most famous example is the stats screen of [my hit game _YOYOZO_](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/). With this one I already had a TTF font file that I’d created for the manual, so I went the extra mile and planned a pixel perfect layout in the right colours and everything. A fun fact you might not know: _YOYOZO_ was featured in Ars Technica’s “Best Games of 2023” list, alongside Mario and Zelda. This spreadsheet thing is great!

## Enhanced sfxr

This year I’ve made two enhanced versions of sfxr— [one for Love2D](https://gingerbeardman.itch.io/enhanced-sfxr-for-love2d) and [one for macOS](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Agingerbeardman%20sfxr&#38;src=typed_query&#38;f=live)—and I can’t remember which one this was done for.

## Spindle

Another of my “coming soon” apps is [an optical media dumper whose USP is its ability to dump from multiple drives at the same time](https://twitter.com/search?q=from:gingerbeardman%20spindle&#38;src=typed_query&#38;f=live).

## Driving Game

This final one is an example of a racing game. Something that you might already be more familiar with and so be able to figure out how you can apply the technique to your own work. Something like Mario Kart, F-Zero, Colin McRae Rally, or WipEout. Let’s go!

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills">simonw/claude-skills</a></strong></p>
        One of the tips I picked up from <a href="https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/">Jesse Vincent's Claude Code Superpowers post</a> (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/10/superpowers/">previously</a>) was this:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Skills are what give your agents Superpowers.</p>
        <p>The first time they really popped up on my radar was a few weeks ago when Anthropic rolled out improved Office document creation. When the feature rolled out, I went poking around a bit -- I asked Claude to tell me all about its new skills. And it was <a href="https://claude.ai/share/0fe5a9c0-4e5a-42a1-9df7-c5b7636dad92">only too happy to dish</a>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In that transcript Jesse asks how the skill system works and Claude replies:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Looking at the skills system, here's how it works:</p>
        <p><strong>Current Skills</strong> (in <code>/mnt/skills/public/</code>):</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>docx</strong> - Word document handling</li>
        <li><strong>pdf</strong> - PDF processing and form filling</li>
        <li><strong>pptx</strong> - PowerPoint presentations</li>
        <li><strong>xlsx</strong> - Excel spreadsheets</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This looks like it's part of Claude's brand new Code Interpreter feature! I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/">wrote about that extensively</a> last month, but I missed that there was a <code>/mnt/skills/public/</code> folder full of fascinating implementation details.</p>
        <p>So I fired up a fresh Claude instance (fun fact: Code Interpreter also works in the Claude iOS app now, which it didn't when they first launched) and prompted:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Create a zip file of everything in your /mnt/skills folder</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This worked, and gave me a <code>.zip</code> to download. You can <a href="https://claude.ai/new?q=Create%20a%20zip%20file%20of%20everything%20in%20your%20%2Fmnt%2Fskills%20folder">run the prompt yourself here</a>, though you'll need to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/#switching-it-on-in-settings-features">enable the new feature first</a>.</p>
        <p>I've pushed the contents of that zip to my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills">new simonw/claude-skills GitHub repo</a>.</p>
        <p>So now you can see the prompts Anthropic wrote to enable the creation and manipulation of the following files in their Claude consumer applications:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills/blob/initial/mnt/skills/public/pdf/SKILL.md">pdf</a> - PDF files</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills/blob/initial/mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md">docx</a> - Microsoft Word</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills/blob/initial/mnt/skills/public/pptx/SKILL.md">pptx</a> - Microsoft PowerPoint decks</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills/blob/initial/mnt/skills/public/xlsx/SKILL.md">xlsx</a> - Microsoft Excel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In each case the prompts spell out detailed instructions for manipulating those file types using Python, using libraries that come pre-installed on Claude's containers.</p>
        <p>Skills are more than just prompts though: the repository also includes dozens of pre-written Python scripts for performing common operations.</p>

      <source:markdown>**[simonw/claude-skills](https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills)**

One of the tips I picked up from [Jesse Vincent&#39;s Claude Code Superpowers post](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/) ( [previously](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/10/superpowers/)) was this:

&#62; Skills are what give your agents Superpowers.
&#62;
&#62; The first time they really popped up on my radar was a few weeks ago when Anthropic rolled out improved Office document creation. When the feature rolled out, I went poking around a bit -- I asked Claude to tell me all about its new skills. And it was [only too happy to dish](https://claude.ai/share/0fe5a9c0-4e5a-42a1-9df7-c5b7636dad92).

In that transcript Jesse asks how the skill system works and Claude replies:

&#62; Looking at the skills system, here&#39;s how it works:
&#62;
&#62; **Current Skills** (in `/mnt/skills/public/`):
&#62;
&#62; - **docx** \- Word document handling
&#62; - **pdf** \- PDF processing and form filling
&#62; - **pptx** \- PowerPoint presentations
&#62; - **xlsx** \- Excel spreadsheets

This looks like it&#39;s part of Claude&#39;s brand new Code Interpreter feature! I [wrote about that extensively](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/) last month, but I missed that there was a `/mnt/skills/public/` folder full of fascinating implementation details.

So I fired up a fresh Claude instance (fun fact: Code Interpreter also works in the Claude iOS app now, which it didn&#39;t when they first launched) and prompted:

&#62; `Create a zip file of everything in your /mnt/skills folder`

This worked, and gave me a `.zip` to download. You can [run the prompt yourself here](https://claude.ai/new?q=Create%20a%20zip%20file%20of%20everything%20in%20your%20%2Fmnt%2Fskills%20folder), though you&#39;ll need to [enable the new feature first](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/#switching-it-on-in-settings-features).

I&#39;ve pushed the contents of that zip to my [new simonw/claude-skills GitHub repo](https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills).

So now you can see the prompts Anthropic wrote to enable the creation and manipulation of the following files in their Claude consumer applications:

- [pdf](https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills/blob/initial/mnt/skills/public/pdf/SKILL.md) \- PDF files
- [docx](https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills/blob/initial/mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md) \- Microsoft Word
- [pptx](https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills/blob/initial/mnt/skills/public/pptx/SKILL.md) \- Microsoft PowerPoint decks
- [xlsx](https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills/blob/initial/mnt/skills/public/xlsx/SKILL.md) \- Microsoft Excel

In each case the prompts spell out detailed instructions for manipulating those file types using Python, using libraries that come pre-installed on Claude&#39;s containers.

Skills are more than just prompts though: the repository also includes dozens of pre-written Python scripts for performing common operations.

[pdf/scripts/fill\_fillable\_fields.py](https://github.com/simonw/claude-skills/blob/initial/mnt/skills/public/pdf/scripts/fill_fillable_fields.py) for example is a custom CLI tool that uses [pypdf](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) to find and then fill in a bunch of PDF form fields, specified as JSON, then render out the resulting combined PDF.

This is a really sophisticated set of tools for document manipulation, and I love that Anthropic have made those visible - presumably deliberately - to users of Claude who know how to ask for them.

        <p>Claude Code <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-plugins">just launched plugins</a>, and Jesse is celebrating by wrapping up a whole host of his accumulated tricks as a new plugin called <a href="https://github.com/obra/superpowers">Superpowers</a>.

      <source:markdown>**[Superpowers: How I&#39;m using coding agents in October 2025](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/)**

A follow-up to Jesse Vincent&#39;s post [about September](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/05/how-im-using-coding-agents-in-september-2025/), but this is a really significant piece in its own right.

Jesse is one of the most creative users of coding agents (Claude Code in particular) that I know. He&#39;s put a great amount of work into evolving an effective process for working with them, encourage red/green TDD (watch the test fail first), planning steps, self-updating memory notes and even implementing a [feelings journal](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/05/28/dear-diary-the-user-asked-me-if-im-alive/) (&#34;I feel engaged and curious about this project&#34; - Claude).

Claude Code [just launched plugins](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-plugins), and Jesse is celebrating by wrapping up a whole host of his accumulated tricks as a new plugin called [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). You can add it to your Claude Code like this:

```
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace

```

There&#39;s a lot in here! It&#39;s worth spending some time [browsing the repository](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) \- here&#39;s just one fun example, in [skills/debugging/root-cause-tracing/SKILL.md](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/main/skills/debugging/root-cause-tracing/SKILL.md):

&#62; ```
&#62; ---
&#62; name: Root Cause Tracing
&#62; description: Systematically trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
&#62; when_to_use: Bug appears deep in call stack but you need to find where it originates
&#62; version: 1.0.0
&#62; languages: all
&#62; ---
&#62;
&#62; ```
&#62;
&#62; **Overview**
&#62;
&#62; Bugs often manifest deep in the call stack (git init in wrong directory, file created in wrong location, database opened with wrong path). Your instinct is to fix where the error appears, but that&#39;s treating a symptom.
&#62;
&#62; **Core principle:** Trace backward through the call chain until you find the original trigger, then fix at the source.
&#62;
&#62; **When to Use**
&#62;
&#62; ```
&#62; digraph when_to_use {
&#62;     &#34;Bug appears deep in stack?&#34; [shape=diamond];
&#62;     &#34;Can trace backwards?&#34; [shape=diamond];
&#62;     &#34;Fix at symptom point&#34; [shape=box];
&#62;     &#34;Trace to original trigger&#34; [shape=box];
&#62;     &#34;BETTER: Also add defense-in-depth&#34; [shape=box];
&#62;
&#62;     &#34;Bug appears deep in stack?&#34; -&#62; &#34;Can trace backwards?&#34; [label=&#34;yes&#34;];
&#62;     &#34;Can trace backwards?&#34; -&#62; &#34;Trace to original trigger&#34; [label=&#34;yes&#34;];
&#62;     &#34;Can trace backwards?&#34; -&#62; &#34;Fix at symptom point&#34; [label=&#34;no - dead end&#34;];
&#62;     &#34;Trace to original trigger&#34; -&#62; &#34;BETTER: Also add defense-in-depth&#34;;
&#62; }
&#62;
&#62; ```
&#62;
&#62; \[...\]

This one is particularly fun because it then includes a [Graphviz DOT graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) illustrating the process - it turns out Claude can interpret those as workflow instructions just fine, and Jesse has been [wildly experimenting with them](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/09/29/using-graphviz-for-claudemd/).

I [vibe-coded up](https://claude.ai/share/2b78a93e-cdc3-4b1d-9b02-457eb62140a5) a quick URL-based DOT visualizer, [here&#39;s that one rendered](https://tools.simonwillison.net/dot#digraph%20when_to_use%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22Bug%20appears%20deep%20in%20stack%3F%22%20%5Bshape%3Ddiamond%5D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%22Can%20trace%20backwards%3F%22%20%5Bshape%3Ddiamond%5D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%22Fix%20at%20symptom%20point%22%20%5Bshape%3Dbox%5D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%22Trace%20to%20original%20trigger%22%20%5Bshape%3Dbox%5D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%22BETTER%3A%20Also%20add%20defense-in-depth%22%20%5Bshape%3Dbox%5D%3B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%22Bug%20appears%20deep%20in%20stack%3F%22%20-%3E%20%22Can%20trace%20backwards%3F%22%20%5Blabel%3D%22yes%22%5D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%22Can%20trace%20backwards%3F%22%20-%3E%20%22Trace%20to%20original%20trigger%22%20%5Blabel%3D%22yes%22%5D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%22Can%20trace%20backwards%3F%22%20-%3E%20%22Fix%20at%20symptom%20point%22%20%5Blabel%3D%22no%20-%20dead%20end%22%5D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%22Trace%20to%20original%20trigger%22%20-%3E%20%22BETTER%3A%20Also%20add%20defense-in-depth%22%3B%0A%7D):

![The above DOT rendered as an image](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/jesse-dot.jpg)

There is _so much_ to learn about putting these tools to work in the most effective way possible. Jesse is way ahead of the curve, so it&#39;s absolutely worth spending some time exploring what he&#39;s shared so far.

And if you&#39;re worried about filling up your context with a bunch of extra stuff, here&#39;s [a reassuring note from Jesse](https://bsky.app/profile/s.ly/post/3m2srmkergc2p):

&#62; The core of it is VERY token light. It pulls in one doc of fewer than 2k tokens. As it needs bits of the process, it runs a shell script to search for them. The long end to end chat for the planning and implementation process for that todo list app was 100k tokens.
&#62;
&#62; It uses subagents to manage token-heavy stuff, including all the actual implementation.

(Jesse&#39;s post also tipped me off about Claude&#39;s `/mnt/skills/public` folder, see [my notes here](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/10/claude-skills/).)

      <source:markdown>**[A Retrospective Survey of 2024/2025 Open Source Supply Chain Compromises](https://words.filippo.io/compromise-survey/)**

Filippo Valsorda surveyed 18 incidents from the past year of open source supply chain attacks, where package updates were infected with malware thanks to a compromise of the project itself.

These are important lessons:

&#62; I have the growing impression that software supply chain compromises have a few predominant causes which we might have a responsibility as a professional open source maintainers to robustly mitigate.
&#62;
&#62; To test this impression and figure out any such mitigations, I collected all 2024/2025 open source supply chain compromises I could find, and categorized their root cause.

This is a fascinating piece of research. 5 were the result of phishing (maintainers should use passkeys/WebAuthn!), ~5 were stolen long-lived credentials, 3 were &#34;control handoff&#34; where a maintainer gave project access to someone who later turned out to be untrustworthy, 4 were caused by GitHub Actions workflows that triggered on pull requests or issue comments in a way that could leak credentials, and one ( [MavenGate](https://blog.oversecured.com/Introducing-MavenGate-a-supply-chain-attack-method-for-Java-and-Android-applications/)) was caused by [an expired domain](https://blog.oversecured.com/Introducing-MavenGate-a-supply-chain-attack-method-for-Java-and-Android-applications/#method-of-attacks) being resurrected.

      <source:markdown>If you don&#39;t like Jujutsu, you&#39;re wrong

As all developers, I’ve been using git since the dawn of time, since its commands were an inscrutable jumble of ill-fitting incantations, and it has remained this way until today.
Needless to say, I just don’t get git.
I never got it, even though I’ve read a bunch of stuff on how it represents things internally.
I’ve been using it for years knowing what a few commands do, and whenever it gets into a weird state because I fat-fingered something, I have my trusty alias, `fuckgit`, that deletes the `.git` directory, clones the repo again into a temp folder, and moves the `.git` directory from that into my directory, and I’ve managed to eke out a living for my family this way.

Over the past few years, I’ve been seeing people rave about [Jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj), and I always wanted to try it, but it never seemed worth the trouble, even though I hate how hard git makes some things.
I idly read a few tutorials, trying to understand how it works, but in the end I decided it wasn’t for me.

One day I randomly decided to try again, but this time I asked Claude how to do with Jujutsu whatever operation I wanted to do with git.
That’s when the mental model of jj clicked for me, and I finally understood everything, _including how git works_.
I never thought a VCS would spark joy in me, but here we are, and I figured maybe I can write something that will make jj click for you as well.

It also doesn’t hurt that Jujutsu is completely interoperable with git (and thus with providers like GitHub), and I can have all the power of Jujutsu locally on my git repos, without anyone knowing I’m not actually using git.

        <![CDATA[<p>I was just catching up on tweets and saw an <a href="https://x.com/ryanwelcher/status/1975704588985778593">announcement</a> earlier this week that Matt Mullenweg is going to lead a town hall discussion at WordCamp Canada next Friday in Ottawa. A week from today. I find that exciting. I'll in the room for sure, and blogging it. Why not? ;-)</p>
        <p>I am presenting the day before, where I'll do a demo of the new WordLand, explaining how it's now twice the product it was last time you all saw it. It is still centered on WordPress as the place where all the user's writing is published. And somehow through the magic of software, we manage to make it into a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/05/boostrappingADecentralized.html">social network</a>. And the cool thing about the whole stack of software we build on, all of it is replaceable and of the web, in every sense.</p>
        <p>There are things that Bluesky and Mastodon can do that WordLand can't. But there are also many many things we can do with the structure that WordLand creates that the others can't touch. There's a simple reason for that, if implementing something, no matter how attractive, without limiting the web-ness of the system, we didn't do it. This is the social network of the web. That means all the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/753804.Small_Pieces_Loosely_Joined">pieces</a> connect with each other in fantastic unforeseeable ways. And anyone can discover these connections. That was the joy of the early web, the thought "Hey I think I can do that" and when you try, it works! We're back there again, if the people come. The technical challenge is still there but now is smaller. Getting people to look and fall in love (hopefully) is the big challenge.</p>
        <p>After WordLand 0.8 is ready, real soon now, who knows what's next? That's the glory a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/05/boostrappingADecentralized.html">bootstrap</a>. Every step tells you where to go next. That's how you know you're hitting a target.</p>
        <p>I don't know if Matt will be there for my demo, I hope he is. He and Automattic and the community have created a fantastic platform. Finding WordPress has a super powerful API that I didn't know about is like finding a new web. Let me know if you see it too. ;-)</p>
        <p>So thanks Matt for your great contribution. I hope to be able to thank you for that personally in Ottawa next week. Perfect timing.</p>

      <source:markdown>A friend asked me if I could build him a simple website for his new Mechanical Engineering business: just a few pages showing off what they’re about and what they can do.

This is the sort of work I did when I was just starting out with web dev - marketing sites. It’s been 14 years since I worked a gig like this, and I was so struck by how much easier everything is now.

First of all, the capabilities of CSS are absolutely magical. I needed to [do a course](https://css-for-js.dev/) to catch up on my knowledge and feel confident again but once I did… putting together layouts is a dream.

At one point my friend asked if I could change all the places where they had yellow to blue… back in the day this would have been annoying but all I had to do was update a single custom property! I made multiple Netlify Deploy previews for him to look at with different shades of blue and it all took me under 10 minutes.

And because of improvements to CSS and the native platform you need so much less JavaScript to achieve specific layouts and functionality. When you do need JS, you can just use the regular JavaScript API, no need for third party libraries like jQuery or MooTools (lol).

Look, I am old and I am comparing this to the Dark Ages when we were still on CSS 2, but I just can&#39;t move past how much better and easier everything is!

At the same time I’m cognisant of the fact this isn’t really a job anymore. My friend had no interest in messing with a Squarespace and was willing to pay my hourly rate to build a static site because he knew he could trust me to do a good job. Most clients probably feel differently, and would prefer to either choose these low or no-code tools to make the websites themselves, or employ devs to build bloated React projects. My own day job is building an incredibly complex Web Application.

What a shame that is, as the technology has never been better for developers to build lean, accessible and attractive websites.

Hello and welcome to **A Newsletter of Humorous Writing**, a roundup of the week&#39;s finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. We blasted right past our newsletter anniversary at the end of September, but wanted to take a second to say thank you for reading us every week, especially if you’ve been with us for all eight years. The eighth anniversary gift is traditionally bronze or pottery, so we’re expecting a lot of Neolithic age presents in the mail.

## What We Enjoyed This Week

[**A Series of Messages Tied to Bricks Thrown Through My Ex’s Neighbor’s Window**](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/a-series-of-messages-tied-to-bricks-thrown-through-my-exs-neighbors-window?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-413) **by** [**Daniela Fava**](https://www.instagram.com/danifava32?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-413) _(McSweeney’s)_ We love an original format and big swings. Daniela’s piece does both and keeps the reader on board by building out the premise one step at a time. The situation is wacky, but the character’s decisions have a clear, albeit wacky logic. You can get to fun places by being big, but clear.

Makes for some great juxtapositions.

[**An Open Letter to the Bra Store Clerk Who Gave My Enormous Breasts an Embarrassing Nickname When I Was Coming of Age**](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/an-open-letter-to-the-bra-store-clerk-who-gave-my-enormous-breasts-an-embarrassing-nickname-when-i-was-coming-of-age?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-413) **by** [**Katherine Di Napoli**](https://bsky.app/profile/katherinedinapoli.bsky.social?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-413) _(McSweeney’s)_ Katherine does a wonderful job of finding humor in the emotions and reactions of this memoir piece.

      <source:markdown>Resizeable BAR support on the Raspberry Pi

While not an _absolute_ requirement for modern graphics card support on Linux, [Resizeable BAR](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html) support makes GPUs go faster, by allowing GPUs to throw data back and forth on the PCIe bus in chunks larger than 256 MB.

In January, I opened an issue in the Raspberry Pi Linux repo, [Resizable BAR support on Pi 5](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/6621).

      <source:markdown>_Note this is for the 0.8 release of WordLand coming soooon. Not in the current released product._

A [friend](https://herve.bzh/cute-paste-in-wordland/) asked for this feature a few months back, before we had a Markdown mode in WordLand.

As I&#39;m reviewing the product for first beta I realized I could now implement the feature he asked for.

How to..

1. Copy a URL to the clipboard.
2. Open WordLand, bring it to the front.
3. Go into Markdown mode by clicking the M icon. It turns green.
4. Select the text you want to be a link.
5. Paste the URL copied in step 1.

It creates the link for you, in Markdown syntax of course.

To see it in HTML, just flip the Markdown button off.

I call this feature Cute Paste. :-)

      <source:markdown>I was messing about with some images on a website recently and while I was happy enough with the arrangement on large screens, I thought it would be better to have the images in a kind of carousel on smaller screens—a swipable gallery.

My old brain immediately thought this would be fairly complicated to do, but actually it’s ludicrously straightforward. Just stick this bit of CSS on the containing element inside a media query (or better yet, a container query):

```
display: flex;
overflow-x: auto;

```

That’s it.

Oh, and you can swap out `overflow-x` for `overflow-inline` if, like me, you’re [a fan of logical properties](https://adactio.com/journal/19457). But support for that only just landed in Safari so I’d probably wait a little while before removing the old syntax.

Here’s an example using pictures of some of the lovely people who will be speaking at [Web Day Out](https://webdayout.com/):

![Jemima Abu](https://webdayout.com/img/speakers/jemima-abu.webp)![Rachel Andrew](https://webdayout.com/img/speakers/rachel-andrew.webp)![Lola Odelola](https://webdayout.com/img/speakers/lola-odelola.webp)![Richard Rutter](https://webdayout.com/img/speakers/richard-rutter.webp)![Harry Roberts](https://webdayout.com/img/speakers/harry-roberts.webp)

While you’re at it, add this:

```
overscroll-behavior-inline: contain;

```

Thats prevents the user accidentally triggering a backwards/forwards navigation when they’re swiping.

You could add some more little niceties like this, but you don’t have to:

```
scroll-snap-type: inline mandatory;
scroll-behavior: smooth;

```

And maybe this on the individual items:

```
scroll-snap-align: center;

```

You could progressively enhance even more with the new pseudo-elements like [`::scroll-button()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::scroll-button) and [`::scroll-marker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::scroll-marker) [for Chromium browsers](https://chrome.dev/carousel/).

Apart from that last bit, none of this is particularly new or groundbreaking. But it was a pleasant reminder for me that interactions that used to be complicated to implement are now very straightforward indeed.

Here’s another example that [Ana Tudor brought up yesterday](https://bsky.app/profile/anatudor.bsky.social/post/3m2o6527n6s25):

&#62; You have a `section` with a `p` on the left &#38; an `img` on the right. How do you make the `img` height always be determined by the `p` with the tiniest bit of CSS? 😼
&#62;
&#62; No changing the HTML structure in any way, no pseudos, no background declarations, no JS. Just a tiny bit of #CSS.

Old me would’ve said it can’t be done. But with a little bit of investigating, I found [a nice straightforward solution](https://bsky.app/profile/adactio.com/post/3m2oq23stdk22):

```
section &#62;  img {
  contain: size;
  place-self: stretch;
  object-fit: cover;
}

```

That’ll work whether the `section` has its `display` set to `flex` or `grid`.

There’s something very, very satisfying in finding a simple solution to something you thought would be complicated.

Honestly, I feel like web developers are constantly being gaslit into thinking that complex over-engineered solutions are the only option. When the discourse is being dominated by people invested in frameworks and libraries, all our default thinking will involve frameworks and libraries. That’s not good for users, and I don’t think it’s good for us either.

Of course, the trick is knowing that the simpler solution exists. The information probably isn’t going to fall in your lap—especially when the discourse is dominated by overly-complex JavaScript.

So [get yourself a ticket for Web Day Out](https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out). It’s on Thursday, March 12th, 2026 right here in Brighton.

I guarantee you’ll hear about some magnificent techniques that will allow you to rip out plenty of complex code in favour of letting the browser do the work.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>**[TIL: Testing different Python versions with uv with-editable and uv-test](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/uv-tests)**

While tinkering with upgrading various projects to handle Python 3.14 I finally figured out a universal `uv` recipe for running the tests for the current project in any specified version of Python:

```
uv run --python 3.14 --isolated --with-editable &#39;.[test]&#39; pytest

```

This should work in any directory with a `pyproject.toml` (or even a `setup.py`) that defines a `test` set of extra dependencies and uses `pytest`.

The `--with-editable &#39;.[test]&#39;` bit ensures that changes you make to that directory will be picked up by future test runs. The `--isolated` flag ensures no other environments will affect your test run.

I like this pattern so much I built a little shell script that uses it, [shown here](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/uv-tests#user-content-uv-test). Now I can change to any Python project directory and run:

```
uv-test

```

Or for a different Python version:

```
uv-test -p 3.11

```

I can pass additional `pytest` options too:

```
uv-test -p 3.11 -k permissions

```

      <source:markdown># GHC 9.14.1-alpha3 is now available

#### bgamari - 2025-10-09

The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
third alpha release of GHC 9.14.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at [downloads.haskell.org](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-alpha3).

GHC 9.14 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:

- Significant improvements in specialisation:

  - The `SPECIALISE` pragma now allows use of type application syntax
  - The `SPECIALISE` pragma can be used to specialise for expression arguments
    as well as type arguments.
  - Specialisation is now considerably more reliable in the presence of
    `newtype` s
- Significant improvements GHCi including:

  - Correctness and performance improvements in the bytecode interpreter
  - Features in the GHCi debugger
  - Support for multiple home units in GHCi
- Implementation of the [Explicit Level Imports proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0682-explicit-level-imports.rst)

- `RequiredTypeArgments` can now be used in more contexts

- SSE/AVX2 support in the x86 native code generator backend

- A major update of the Windows toolchain

- … and many more


A full accounting of changes can be found in the [release notes](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-alpha3/docs/users_guide/9.14.1-notes.html). Given the
many specialisation improvements and their potential for regression, we would
very much appreciate testing and performance characterisation on downstream
workloads.

Note that while this release makes many improvements in the specialisation
optimisation, polymorphic specialisation will remain disabled by default in the
final release due to concern over regressions of the sort identified in
[#26329](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26329). Users needing more aggressive specialisation can explicitly
enable this feature with the `-fpolymorphic-specialisation` flag. Depending
upon our experience with 9.14.1, we may enable this feature by default in a
later minor release.

This is the third alpha release of 9.14.1. This comes later than expected in
part due to work on a resolving a regression in the macOS 26 ( [#26166](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26166))
which threatened the usability of the release. While a complete fix for this
issue is not present in this alpha, we have done enough work to have confidence
that it will be in finished for the release candidate which we expect should
come the week of 27 October.

We would like to thank the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed, Mercury, Channable,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and other anonymous
contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind support has facilitated GHC
maintenance and release management over the years. Finally, this release would
not have been possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose
work have made the Haskell ecosystem what it is today.

As always, do give this release a try and open a [ticket](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/homepage/-/issues/new) if you see
anything amiss.</source:markdown>

      <title>Claude can write complete Datasette plugins now</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/8/claude-datasette-plugins/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This isn't necessarily surprising, but it's worth noting anyway. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is capable of building a full Datasette plugin now.</p>
        <p>I've seen models complete aspects of this in the past, but today is the first time I've shipped a new plugin where every line of code and test was written by Claude, with minimal prompting from myself.</p>
        <p>The plugin is called <strong><a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info">datasette-os-info</a></strong>. It's a simple debugging tool - all it does is add a <code>/-/os</code> JSON page which dumps out as much information as it can about the OS it's running on. Here's a <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/-/os">live demo</a> on my TIL website.</p>
        <p>I built it to help experiment with changing the Docker base container that Datasette uses to <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html">publish images</a> to one that uses Python 3.14.</p>
        <p>Here's the full set of commands I used to create the plugin. I started with my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">datasette-plugin</a> cookiecutter template:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uvx cookiecutter gh:simonw/datasette-plugin
        
          [1/8] <span class="pl-en">plugin_name</span> (): os-info
          [2/8] <span class="pl-en">description</span> (): Information about the current OS
          [3/8] hyphenated (os-info): 
          [4/8] underscored (os_info): 
          [5/8] <span class="pl-en">github_username</span> (): datasette
          [6/8] <span class="pl-en">author_name</span> (): Simon Willison
          [7/8] <span class="pl-en">include_static_directory</span> (): 
          [8/8] <span class="pl-en">include_templates_directory</span> (): </pre></div>
        <p>This created a <code>datasette-os-info</code> directory with the initial <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>tests/</code> and <code>datasette_os_info/__init__.py</code> files. Here's an example of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-demo">that starter template</a>.</p>
        <p>I created a <code>uv</code> virtual environment for it, installed the initial test dependencies and ran <code>pytest</code> to check that worked:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> datasette-os-info
        uv venv
        uv sync --extra <span class="pl-c1">test</span>
        uv run pytest</pre></div>
        <p>Then I fired up <a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> in that directory in YOLO mode:</p>

        <p>I dread to think how long it would have taken me to figure out all of those different useful OS details!</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Add authentication requirements to this endpoint</li>
        <li>Make certain fields optional/configurable</li>
        <li>Add a warning in the README that this exposes system information</li>
        <li>Consider filtering out or redacting sensitive paths (replace usernames with ***, etc.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Would you like me to add any of these protections to the plugin?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In this case I'm fine with the current behavior provided people understand the risks, so I told it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Add the warning to the README</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And then (because the warning it added was quite long):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Drop the bit about configuring the permission system, just have a short warning telling people to review what it exposes</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And requested an extra README note:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Add a note that you can also see the output by running: datasette --get /-/os</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Three last prompts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>Add uv.lock to gitignore</code></li>
        <li><code>Drop Python 3.9 and add Python 3.14 - to the GitHub workflows, also min version in pyproject.toml</code></li>
        <li><code>Bump to setup-python@v6</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>... and that was the project finished. I pushed it <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info">to GitHub</a>, <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/pypi/pypi-releases-from-github">configured Trusted Publishing</a> for it on PyPI and posted <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info/releases/tag/0.1">the 0.1 release</a>, which ran <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info/blob/0.1/.github/workflows/publish.yml">this GitHub Actions publish.yml</a> and deployed that release <a href="https://pypi.org/project/datasette-os-info/">to datasette-os-info on PyPI</a>.</p>
        <p>Now that it's live you can try it out without even installing Datasette using a <code>uv</code> one-liner like this:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uv run --isolated \
          --with datasette-os-info \
          datasette --get /-/os</pre></div>
        <p>That's using the <code>--get PATH</code> CLI option to show what that path in the Datasette instance would return, as <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/cli-reference.html#datasette-get">described in the Datasette documentation</a>.</p>
        <p>I've shared <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/85fd7a76589dc01950e71d8e606cd5dd">my full Claude Code transcript</a> in a Gist.</p>
        <p>A year ago I'd have been <em>very</em> impressed by this. Today I wasn't even particularly surprised that this worked - the coding agent pattern implemented by Claude Code is spectacularly effective when you combine it with pre-existing templates, and Datasette has been aroung for long enough now that plenty of examples of plugins have made it into the training data for the leading models.</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>This isn&#39;t necessarily surprising, but it&#39;s worth noting anyway. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is capable of building a full Datasette plugin now.

I&#39;ve seen models complete aspects of this in the past, but today is the first time I&#39;ve shipped a new plugin where every line of code and test was written by Claude, with minimal prompting from myself.

The plugin is called **[datasette-os-info](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info)**. It&#39;s a simple debugging tool - all it does is add a `/-/os` JSON page which dumps out as much information as it can about the OS it&#39;s running on. Here&#39;s a [live demo](https://til.simonwillison.net/-/os) on my TIL website.

I built it to help experiment with changing the Docker base container that Datasette uses to [publish images](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html) to one that uses Python 3.14.

Here&#39;s the full set of commands I used to create the plugin. I started with my [datasette-plugin](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin) cookiecutter template:

```
uvx cookiecutter gh:simonw/datasette-plugin

  [1/8] plugin_name (): os-info
  [2/8] description (): Information about the current OS
  [3/8] hyphenated (os-info):
  [4/8] underscored (os_info):
  [5/8] github_username (): datasette
  [6/8] author_name (): Simon Willison
  [7/8] include_static_directory ():
  [8/8] include_templates_directory ():
```

This created a `datasette-os-info` directory with the initial `pyproject.toml` and `tests/` and `datasette_os_info/__init__.py` files. Here&#39;s an example of [that starter template](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-demo).

I created a `uv` virtual environment for it, installed the initial test dependencies and ran `pytest` to check that worked:

```
cd datasette-os-info
uv venv
uv sync --extra test
uv run pytest
```

Then I fired up [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) in that directory in YOLO mode:

```
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

(I actually used my `claude-yolo` shortcut which runs the above.)

Then, in Claude, I told it how to run the tests:

&#62; `Run uv run pytest`

When that worked, I told it to build the plugin:

&#62; `This is a Datasette plugin which should add a new page /-/os which returns pretty-printed JSON about the current operating system - implement it. I want to pick up as many details as possible across as many OS as possible, including if possible figuring out the base image if it is in a docker container - otherwise the Debian OS release name and suchlike would be good`

... and that was it! Claude [implemented the plugin](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info/blob/0.1/datasette_os_info/__init__.py) using Datasette&#39;s [register\_routes() plugin hook](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#register-routes-datasette) to add the `/-/os` page,and then without me prompting it to do so [built this basic test as well](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info/blob/0.1/tests/test_os_info.py).

It ran the new test, spotted a bug (it had guessed a non-existent `Response(..., default_repr=)` parameter), fixed the bug and declared itself done.

I built myself a wheel:

```
uv pip install build
uv run python -m build
```

Then uploaded that to an S3 bucket and deployed it to test it out using `datasette publish ... --install URL-to-wheel`. It did exactly what I had hoped - here&#39;s what that `/-/os` page looked like:

```

  },

}
```

I dread to think how long it would have taken me to figure out all of those different useful OS details!

To finish up, I had Claude fill out the README via a couple of extra prompts:

&#62; `Add usage instructions to the README (about the /-/os page)`

Then had a brief conversation about how safe the output was:

&#62; `Is there anything potentially sensitive in that output?`

Claude said:

&#62; Yes, there are several potentially sensitive items in the output:
&#62;
&#62; Most sensitive:
&#62;
&#62; - hostname - Could reveal internal naming schemes or organization details
&#62; - Environment variables:
&#62;   - HOME - Reveals user&#39;s home directory path
&#62;   - USER - Reveals the username
&#62;   - PATH - Reveals filesystem structure and software installation locations
&#62;   - VIRTUAL\_ENV - Could reveal project paths and directory structure
&#62; - python\_executable - Reveals filesystem paths and user directories
&#62;
&#62; Moderately sensitive:
&#62;
&#62; - CPU count and memory info - Could reveal infrastructure capacity
&#62; - Kernel version details - Could potentially be used to identify specific vulnerabilities
&#62;
&#62; Considerations:
&#62;
&#62; 1. This endpoint is accessible without authentication by default (at /-/os)
&#62; 2. If you&#39;re running Datasette on a public server, this information would be visible to anyone
&#62; 3. The information could help attackers understand your infrastructure setup
&#62;
&#62; Suggestions:
&#62;
&#62; You might want to:
&#62;
&#62; 1. Add authentication requirements to this endpoint
&#62; 2. Make certain fields optional/configurable
&#62; 3. Add a warning in the README that this exposes system information
&#62; 4. Consider filtering out or redacting sensitive paths (replace usernames with \*\*\*, etc.)
&#62;
&#62; Would you like me to add any of these protections to the plugin?

In this case I&#39;m fine with the current behavior provided people understand the risks, so I told it:

&#62; `Add the warning to the README`

And then (because the warning it added was quite long):

&#62; `Drop the bit about configuring the permission system, just have a short warning telling people to review what it exposes`

And requested an extra README note:

&#62; `Add a note that you can also see the output by running: datasette --get /-/os`

Three last prompts:

- `Add uv.lock to gitignore`
- `Drop Python 3.9 and add Python 3.14 - to the GitHub workflows, also min version in pyproject.toml`
- `Bump to setup-python@v6`

... and that was the project finished. I pushed it [to GitHub](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info), [configured Trusted Publishing](https://til.simonwillison.net/pypi/pypi-releases-from-github) for it on PyPI and posted [the 0.1 release](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info/releases/tag/0.1), which ran [this GitHub Actions publish.yml](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-os-info/blob/0.1/.github/workflows/publish.yml) and deployed that release [to datasette-os-info on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/datasette-os-info/).

Now that it&#39;s live you can try it out without even installing Datasette using a `uv` one-liner like this:

```
uv run --isolated \
  --with datasette-os-info \
  datasette --get /-/os
```

That&#39;s using the `--get PATH` CLI option to show what that path in the Datasette instance would return, as [described in the Datasette documentation](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/cli-reference.html#datasette-get).

I&#39;ve shared [my full Claude Code transcript](https://gist.github.com/simonw/85fd7a76589dc01950e71d8e606cd5dd) in a Gist.

A year ago I&#39;d have been _very_ impressed by this. Today I wasn&#39;t even particularly surprised that this worked - the coding agent pattern implemented by Claude Code is spectacularly effective when you combine it with pre-existing templates, and Datasette has been aroung for long enough now that plenty of examples of plugins have made it into the training data for the leading models.

Miguel Grinberg uses some basic benchmarks (like `fib(40)`) to test the new Python 3.14 on Linux and macOS and finds some substantial speedups over Python 3.13 - around 27% faster.

The optional JIT didn&#39;t make a meaningful difference to his benchmarks. On a threaded benchmark he got 3.09x speedup with 4 threads using the free threading build - for Python 3.13 the free threading build only provided a 2.2x improvement.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote cite="https://hojberg.xyz/the-programmer-identity-crisis/"><p>The cognitive debt of LLM-laden coding extends beyond disengagement of our craft. We’ve all heard the stories. Hyped up, vibed up, slop-jockeys with attention spans shorter than the framework-hopping JavaScript devs of the early 2010s, sling their sludge in pull requests and design docs, discouraging collaboration and disrupting teams. Code reviewing coworkers are rapidly losing their minds as they come to the crushing realization that they are now the first layer of quality control instead of one of the last. Asked to review; forced to pick apart. Calling out freshly added functions that are never called, hallucinated library additions, and obvious runtime or compilation errors.

      <source:markdown>&#62; The cognitive debt of LLM-laden coding extends beyond disengagement of our craft. We’ve all heard the stories. Hyped up, vibed up, slop-jockeys with attention spans shorter than the framework-hopping JavaScript devs of the early 2010s, sling their sludge in pull requests and design docs, discouraging collaboration and disrupting teams. Code reviewing coworkers are rapidly losing their minds as they come to the crushing realization that they are now the first layer of quality control instead of one of the last. Asked to review; forced to pick apart. Calling out freshly added functions that are never called, hallucinated library additions, and obvious runtime or compilation errors. All while the author—who clearly only skimmed their “own” code—is taking no responsibility, going “whoopsie, Claude wrote that. Silly AI, ha-ha.”

      <source:markdown>**[Why NetNewsWire Is Not a Web App](https://inessential.com/2025/10/04/why-netnewswire-is-not-web-app.html)**

In the wake of Apple [removing ICEBlock from the App Store](https://daringfireball.net/2025/10/iceblock_removed_from_app_store), Brent Simmons talks about why he still thinks his veteran (and actively maintained) [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) feed reader app should remain a native application.

Part of the reason is cost - NetNewsWire is free these days (MIT licensed in fact) and the cost to Brent is an annual Apple developer subscription:

&#62; If it were a web app instead, I could drop the developer membership, but I’d have to pay way more money for web and database hosting. \[...\] I could charge for NetNewsWire, but that would go against my political goal of making sure there’s a good and _free_ RSS reader available to everyone.

A bigger reason is around privacy and protecting users:

&#62; Second issue. Right now, if law enforcement comes to me and demands I turn over a given user’s subscriptions list, I can’t. Literally can’t. I don’t have an encrypted version, even — I have nothing at all. The list lives on their machine (iOS or macOS).

And finally it&#39;s about the principle of what a personal computing device should mean:

&#62; My computer is _not_ a terminal. It’s a world I get to control, and I can use — and, especially, _make_ — whatever I want. I’m not stuck using just what’s provided to me on some other machines elsewhere: I’m not dialing into a mainframe or doing the modern equivalent of using only websites that other people control.

      <title>Halloween in the Round</title>
      <link>https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2024/10/12/halloween-data-cleaning/">Last year</a> I wrote about cleaning some data from the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars">NHTSA FARS database</a>, the system that tracks information about road accidents in the United States. I did that again this year for my <a href="https://mptc.io/">Modern Plain Text Computing</a> class. I won&rsquo;t repeat the cleaning details, which are more or less the same. One question is how to aggregate data like this, if at all, and how to draw a picture of it. There are, as always, lots of options. The data as obtained (with a <em>slightly</em> different query from last year; a small lesson in itself about repeated measures) arrive as counts of pedestrian fatalities (in motor vehicle accidents) for each day of the year, within months, for each year from 2009 to 2023.</p>

                    <p>The data in the spreadsheet you get after a specific query to FARS on the web.</p>
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>What I was interested in was patterns of daily counts, so I wanted to average by day across years. This sort of aggregation  of course gets rid of other things we might be interested in, like trends over time by year. Averaging by day means we won&rsquo;t see, for example, any tendency for the number of pedestrian deaths to decrease over time. One way to draw this is a column chart with time (as day-of-the-year) on the x-axis and the average count on the y-axis.</p>
        <figure><a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/halloween_wide.png" data-fancybox>
            <img src="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/halloween_wide.png"
                 alt="Wide version."/></a><figcaption>
                    <p>Wide version.</p>
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This works fine. Nice and compact. One thing people tend to underestimate about graphs like this (whether as bars or lines) is that you can often compress the vertical axis a lot without loss of information. Indeed, often with long time series that&rsquo;s the right thing to do anyway, because there&rsquo;s nothing better for making your trends look dramatic than narrowing the horizontal part of the aspect ratio. Here the focus is not on a trend, but on the one day that really stands out from the others. In any case, wide is good.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, most people are looking at things on their phones. Maybe a vertical view can be better there? We could do something like this, like last year:</p>
        <figure><a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/halloween_tall25.png" data-fancybox>
            <img src="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/halloween_tall25.png"
                 alt="Tall version."/></a><figcaption>
                    <p>Tall version.</p>
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Here we facet by month and stack them. It works OK. This would be more useful for data where you expect a bit more structure down the rows as well as across the columns of the table you&rsquo;re graphing. For example, accidents vary by day of the week, especially pedestrian accidents. There are more people out at the weekend. And then for some parts of the country the seasonality of pedestrian activity would be stronger than in others, because it&rsquo;s nicer to be outside some months of the year than others. (You can in fact get counts by day of the week from FARS, but I didn&rsquo;t; exercise for the reader, etc.) Even in this one you can see some evidence of that, as Summer and (back to school) Fall have more fatalities than January, for instance.</p>
        <p>Finally, and the point of this post, we can also experiment with the fact that the year is cyclical, and use polar coordinates. When we do this we take our x-axis and wrap it around a circle. Position on the x-axis measured as a distance becomes position on a polar or radial axis measured as an angle. We call it theta and measure in degrees or radians or whatever. In ggplot <code>coord_polar()</code> is available as a transformation to do this. One of the nice things about ggplot&rsquo;s grammar-of-graphics approach is that it makes it easier to show how the same graph can change under various transformations. A standard xy plot has its coordinates set up by the <code>coord_cartesian()</code> function. We usually never write this unless explicitly want to tweak some aspect of it, but it&rsquo;s there. But we can just replace it altogether with a different coordinate transformation altogether. This can be a polar system or something else, as when we draw a map and systematically transform points on a sphere into a flat surface via some projection.</p>
        <p>Version 4 of ggplot came out last month and introduced <code>coord_radial()</code> as an improved version of <code>coord_polar()</code>. We can use it to draw our plot. Here we&rsquo;ll use a FARS dataset that shows fatal crashes that involve pedestrians aged 17 and under. (The difference from the ones above is that pedestrians were &ldquo;involved&rdquo; in the crash but weren&rsquo;t necessarily killed.) We write code that looks like this:</p>

        <p>Not bad. You have to be careful with polar coordinates. People are much better at judging relative lengths than relative angles. This is why pie charts are hated by dataviz nerds. A pie chart is, after all, just a bar or column chart whose x-axis has been spun into a circle. In this case, our humble wide-aspect column plot does perfectly well for much less effort, and has the advantage of being immediately comprehensible by more people. There are cases where truly seasonal data can really benefit from being represented on or in a circle. This data isn&rsquo;t quite one of those, as we&rsquo;re just saying &ldquo;Hey, look how this one day is different from all the others&rdquo;. But by the same token, we&rsquo;re not really asking the viewer to judge angular offsets or to estimate the area of a pie wedge. Instead it&rsquo;s just distance from the inner circle. Seeing the points for all the other days cluster close to the inner ring while Halloween stands out a ways does a decent job of getting the content across, and maybe in a way friendlier to people looking at the plot on a phone.</p>
        <p>PS: One other thing. Remember, as we also noted last year, that any inference about how dangerous Halloween is for child pedestrians shouldn&rsquo;t depend just on the number of fatalities observed but also on the exposure, which we don&rsquo;t see directly.

      </description>
      <source:markdown>[Last year](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2024/10/12/halloween-data-cleaning/) I wrote about cleaning some data from the [NHTSA FARS database](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars), the system that tracks information about road accidents in the United States. I did that again this year for my [Modern Plain Text Computing](https://mptc.io/) class. I won’t repeat the cleaning details, which are more or less the same. One question is how to aggregate data like this, if at all, and how to draw a picture of it. There are, as always, lots of options. The data as obtained (with a _slightly_ different query from last year; a small lesson in itself about repeated measures) arrive as counts of pedestrian fatalities (in motor vehicle accidents) for each day of the year, within months, for each year from 2009 to 2023.

[![The data in the spreadsheet you get after a specific query to FARS on the web.](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/fars-fatalities.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/fars-fatalities.png)

The data in the spreadsheet you get after a specific query to FARS on the web.

What I was interested in was patterns of daily counts, so I wanted to average by day across years. This sort of aggregation of course gets rid of other things we might be interested in, like trends over time by year. Averaging by day means we won’t see, for example, any tendency for the number of pedestrian deaths to decrease over time. One way to draw this is a column chart with time (as day-of-the-year) on the x-axis and the average count on the y-axis.

[![Wide version.](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/halloween_wide.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/halloween_wide.png)

Wide version.

This works fine. Nice and compact. One thing people tend to underestimate about graphs like this (whether as bars or lines) is that you can often compress the vertical axis a lot without loss of information. Indeed, often with long time series that’s the right thing to do anyway, because there’s nothing better for making your trends look dramatic than narrowing the horizontal part of the aspect ratio. Here the focus is not on a trend, but on the one day that really stands out from the others. In any case, wide is good.

On the other hand, most people are looking at things on their phones. Maybe a vertical view can be better there? We could do something like this, like last year:

[![Tall version.](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/halloween_tall25.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/08/halloween-in-the-round/halloween_tall25.png)

Tall version.

Here we facet by month and stack them. It works OK. This would be more useful for data where you expect a bit more structure down the rows as well as across the columns of the table you’re graphing. For example, accidents vary by day of the week, especially pedestrian accidents. There are more people out at the weekend. And then for some parts of the country the seasonality of pedestrian activity would be stronger than in others, because it’s nicer to be outside some months of the year than others. (You can in fact get counts by day of the week from FARS, but I didn’t; exercise for the reader, etc.) Even in this one you can see some evidence of that, as Summer and (back to school) Fall have more fatalities than January, for instance.

Finally, and the point of this post, we can also experiment with the fact that the year is cyclical, and use polar coordinates. When we do this we take our x-axis and wrap it around a circle. Position on the x-axis measured as a distance becomes position on a polar or radial axis measured as an angle. We call it theta and measure in degrees or radians or whatever. In ggplot `coord_polar()` is available as a transformation to do this. One of the nice things about ggplot’s grammar-of-graphics approach is that it makes it easier to show how the same graph can change under various transformations. A standard xy plot has its coordinates set up by the `coord_cartesian()` function. We usually never write this unless explicitly want to tweak some aspect of it, but it’s there. But we can just replace it altogether with a different coordinate transformation altogether. This can be a polar system or something else, as when we draw a map and systematically transform points on a sphere into a flat surface via some projection.

Version 4 of ggplot came out last month and introduced `coord_radial()` as an improved version of `coord_polar()`. We can use it to draw our plot. Here we’ll use a FARS dataset that shows fatal crashes that involve pedestrians aged 17 and under. (The difference from the ones above is that pedestrians were “involved” in the crash but weren’t necessarily killed.) We write code that looks like this:

        axis.text = element_text(face = &#34;bold&#34;),
        axis.ticks.theta = element_blank())
```

This is well beyond the minimum necessary to get a servicable plot, but I got carried away polishing the thing. The key bit is the call to `coord_radial()`:

```
1
2
3
4

```

```r
coord_radial(expand = FALSE,
             rlim = c(0,4.25),
             r.axis.inside = TRUE,
             inner.radius = 0.25)
```

This says: draw the x-axis as a circle; don’t expand the margins (this has the effect of keeping January at the top rather than being slightly decentered); set the y-axis limits (i.e. the length of the radius) to be slightly more than the maximum of the data; put the radial axis inside the plot rather than next to it; and make the circle more like a donut by putting a circular “hole” in the middle of the graph that’s 25 percent of the total length of the radius.

        <![CDATA[<p>A great interview with Ted Chiang:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>Predicting the most likely next word is different from having correct information about the world, which is why LLMs are not a reliable way to get the answers to questions, and I don’t think there is good evidence to suggest that they will become reliable. Over the past couple of years, there have been some papers published suggesting that training LLMs on more data and throwing more processing power at the problem provides diminishing returns in terms of performance. They can get better at reproducing patterns found online, but they don’t become capable of actual reasoning; it seems that the problem is fundamental to their architecture. And you can bolt tools onto the side of an LLM, like giving it a calculator it can use when you ask it a math problem, or giving it access to a search engine when you want up-to-date information, but putting reliable tools under the control of an unreliable program is not enough to make the controlling program reliable. I think we will need a different approach if we want a truly reliable question answerer.</p>

Over the past couple of years, there have been some papers published suggesting that training LLMs on more data and throwing more processing power at the problem provides diminishing returns in terms of performance. They can get better at reproducing patterns found online, but they don’t become capable of actual reasoning; it seems that the problem is fundamental to their architecture. And you can bolt tools onto the side of an LLM, like giving it a calculator it can use when you ask it a math problem, or giving it access to a search engine when you want up-to-date information, but putting reliable tools under the control of an unreliable program is not enough to make the controlling program reliable. I think we will need a different approach if we want a truly reliable question answerer.

      <source:markdown>**[Python 3.14](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3140/)**

This year&#39;s major Python version, Python 3.14, just made its first stable release!

As usual the [what&#39;s new in Python 3.14](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html) document is the best place to get familiar with the new release:

&#62; The biggest changes include [template string literals](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-template-string-literals), [deferred evaluation of annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-deferred-annotations), and support for [subinterpreters](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-multiple-interpreters) in the standard library.
&#62;
&#62; The library changes include significantly improved capabilities for [introspection in asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-asyncio-introspection), [support for Zstandard](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-zstandard) via a new [compression.zstd](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/compression.zstd.html#module-compression.zstd) module, syntax highlighting in the REPL, as well as the usual deprecations and removals, and improvements in user-friendliness and correctness.

Subinterpreters look particularly interesting as a way to use multiple CPU cores to run Python code despite the continued existence of the GIL. If you&#39;re feeling brave and [your dependencies cooperate](https://hugovk.github.io/free-threaded-wheels/) you can also use the free-threaded build of Python 3.14 - [now officially supported](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-free-threaded-now-supported) \- to skip the GIL entirely.

A new major Python release means an older release hits the [end of its support lifecycle](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) \- in this case that&#39;s Python 3.9. If you maintain open source libraries that target every supported Python versions (as I do) this means features introduced in Python 3.10 can now be depended on! [What&#39;s new in Python 3.10](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.10.html) lists those - I&#39;m most excited by [structured pattern matching](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.10.html#pep-634-structural-pattern-matching) (the `match/case` statement) and the [union type operator](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.10.html#pep-604-new-type-union-operator), allowing `int | float | None` as a type annotation in place of `Optional[Union[int, float]]`.

If you use `uv` you can grab a copy of 3.14 using:

```
uv self update
uv python upgrade 3.14
uvx python@3.14

```

Or for free-threaded Python 3.1;:

```
uvx python@3.14t

```

The `uv` team wrote [about their Python 3.14 highlights](https://astral.sh/blog/python-3.14) in their announcement of Python 3.14&#39;s availability via `uv`.

The GitHub Actions [setup-python action](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) includes Python 3.14 now too, so the following YAML snippet in will run tests on all currently supported versions:

```
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: [&#34;3.10&#34;, &#34;3.11&#34;, &#34;3.12&#34;, &#34;3.13&#34;, &#34;3.14&#34;]
steps:
- uses: actions/setup-python@v6
  with:
    python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

```

[Full example here](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-pretty-traces/blob/3edddecab850d6ac47ed128a400b6a0ff8b0c012/.github/workflows/test.yml) for one of my many Datasette plugin repos.

      <link>https://netnewswire.blog/2025/10/07/the-liquid-glass-plan.html</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We’re hearing from folks eager for the Liquid Glass update to NetNewsWire. The bad news is that it’s not coming this week or next (who knows when, really) — but the good news is that it is very much in progress.</p>
        
        <p>Here’s the plan:</p>
        
        <p><strong>NetNewsWire 6.2</strong> for Mac and iOS. This is a Snow-Leopard-style release — the idea is to fix a bunch of bugs knowing that a lot of people, particularly Mac users, may be slow to upgrade to the 26es, and we want them to have something solid to use while they put off upgrading — because the release after this one will require iOS and macOS 26.</p>
        
        <p><strong>NetNewsWire 7</strong> for Mac and iOS. This will be the Liquid Glass release, and, as noted above, it will require iOS and macOS 26.</p>
        
        <p>If you’d like more details, see our <a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/milestone/62">milestone for NetNewsWire 6.2</a>, which is 67% complete at this writing.

        <p>Please note that anything may change at any time! Particularly when it comes to which issues are on which milestones — things get moved around all the time.</p>

      <source:markdown>Google released a new [Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/) today, specially designed to help operate a GUI interface by interacting with visible elements using a virtual mouse and keyboard.

I tried the demo hosted by Browserbase at [gemini.browserbase.com](https://gemini.browserbase.com/) and was delighted and slightly horrified when it appeared to kick things off by first navigating to Google.com and solving their CAPTCHA in order to run a search!

I wrote a post about it and included [this screenshot](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/captcha-solve-gemini-2.jpg), but then learned that Browserbase itself has CAPTCHA solving built in and, as shown [in this longer video](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/browserbase-captcha.mp4), it was Browserbase that solved the CAPTCHA even while Gemini was thinking about doing so itself.

I deeply regret this error. I&#39;ve deleted various social media posts about the original entry and linked back to this retraction instead.

      <title>Social Share Imagery via a Data Attribute</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I’ve done something few on the internet do. I’ve changed my mind.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img data-og-image src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/social-share-meme.jpg" width="332" height="250" alt="Double take meme of girl with a disgusted face on one side then the same girl with a face of changed opinion.

        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/social-share-preview.png" width="543" height="601" alt="Screenshot of a post from @jimniels@mastodon.social showing a link to blog.jim-nielsen.com and an accompanying og:image preview." />
        
        </p><p>You might be wondering, “Wait Jim I thought you hated those things?”</p>
        <p>It’s not that I hate social share imagery. I just think…well, <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/quibbles-with-social-share-imagery/" >I’ve shared my thoughts before</a> (even made <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/omgimg/" >a game</a>) so I won’t get on my soapbox.</p>
        <p>But I think these “previews” have their place and, when used as a preview — i.e. an opportunity to graphically depict a brief portion of the actual, underlying content — these function well <em>in service of readers</em>.</p>
        <p>For example, I often write posts that have zero images in them. They’re pure text. I don’t burden myself with the obligation to generate a graphical preview of the ideas contained in those posts.</p>
        <p>But, sometimes, I create posts that have <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/mac-app-flea-market/" >lots of imagery in them</a>, or even just <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/casing-on-the-web/" >a good meme-like photo</a> and it feels like a shame to <em>not</em> surface that imagery in some way.</p>
        <p>So, in service of that pursuit, I set out to resolve how I could do <a href="https://ogp.me" >og:images</a> in my posts.</p>
        <p>It’s not as easy as “just stick it your front-matter” because <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/markdown-sans-front-matter/" >my markdown files don’t use front-matter</a>. And I didn’t want to “just add front-matter”. I have my own idiosyncratic way of writing markdown for my blog, which means I need my own idiosyncratic way of denoting “this post has an og:image and here’s the URL”.</p>
        <p>After giving it some thought, I realized that all my images are expressed in markdown as HTML (this lets me easily add attributes like <code>alt</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code>) so if I wanted to mark one of my images as the “preview” image for a post, I could  just add a special data attribute like so:</p>
        <pre><code class="language language-md">You guys, I made the funniest image to depict this:
        
        <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">img</span> <span class="hljs-attr">data-og-image</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">width</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">height</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">alt</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span>
        
        Isn’t that hilarious?
        </code></pre>
        <p>Then my markdown processor can extract that piece of meta information and surface it to each post template, essentially like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">title</span>&gt;</span>{post.title}<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">title</span>&gt;</span>
          {post.ogimage &amp;&amp;
            <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">meta</span> <span class="hljs-attr">property</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;og:image&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">content</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{post.ogimage}</span>&gt;</span>}
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">body</span>&gt;</span>
            <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">h1</span>&gt;</span>{post.title}<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">h1</span>&gt;</span>
            {post.content}
        </code></pre>
        <p>I love this because it allows me to leverage existing mechanisms in both the authoring and development processes (data attributes in HTML that become metadata on the <code>post</code> object), without needing to introduce an entirely new method of expression (e.g. front-matter).</p>
        <p>It also feels good because:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>It’s good for me</strong>. It doesn’t require any additional work on my part. I don’t have to create additional images for my posts. I’m merely marking images I’ve already created — which were done in service of a post’s content — as “previews” for the post.</li>
        <li><strong>It’s good for users</strong>. Readers of my site get image previews that are actually, well, previews — e.g. a graphical representation that will contextually reappear in the post, (as opposed to an image template whose contents do nothing to provide an advanced graphical preview of what’s to follow in the post itself).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It’s technology in service of content, rather than content in service of technology.</p>
        <p>Or at least that’s what I like to tell myself :)</p>

      <source:markdown>I’ve done something few on the internet do. I’ve changed my mind.

![Double take meme of girl with a disgusted face on one side then the same girl with a face of changed opinion. Both faces have the text “og:image” superimposed.](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/social-share-meme.jpg)

[A](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/rip-browsers/) [few](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/npm-risks/) [posts](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/my-antis/) on my blog have started to unfurl social share imagery.

![Screenshot of a post from @jimniels@mastodon.social showing a link to blog.jim-nielsen.com and an accompanying og:image preview.](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/social-share-preview.png)

You might be wondering, “Wait Jim I thought you hated those things?”

It’s not that I hate social share imagery. I just think…well, [I’ve shared my thoughts before](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/quibbles-with-social-share-imagery/) (even made [a game](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/omgimg/)) so I won’t get on my soapbox.

But I think these “previews” have their place and, when used as a preview — i.e. an opportunity to graphically depict a brief portion of the actual, underlying content — these function well _in service of readers_.

For example, I often write posts that have zero images in them. They’re pure text. I don’t burden myself with the obligation to generate a graphical preview of the ideas contained in those posts.

But, sometimes, I create posts that have [lots of imagery in them](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/mac-app-flea-market/), or even just [a good meme-like photo](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/casing-on-the-web/) and it feels like a shame to _not_ surface that imagery in some way.

So, in service of that pursuit, I set out to resolve how I could do [og:images](https://ogp.me) in my posts.

It’s not as easy as “just stick it your front-matter” because [my markdown files don’t use front-matter](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/markdown-sans-front-matter/). And I didn’t want to “just add front-matter”. I have my own idiosyncratic way of writing markdown for my blog, which means I need my own idiosyncratic way of denoting “this post has an og:image and here’s the URL”.

After giving it some thought, I realized that all my images are expressed in markdown as HTML (this lets me easily add attributes like `alt`, `width`, and `height`) so if I wanted to mark one of my images as the “preview” image for a post, I could just add a special data attribute like so:

```language md
You guys, I made the funniest image to depict this:

&#60;img data-og-image src=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;&#34; height=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&#62;

Isn’t that hilarious?

```

Then my markdown processor can extract that piece of meta information and surface it to each post template, essentially like this:

```language html
&#60;html&#62;
  &#60;title&#62;{post.title}&#60;/title&#62;
  {post.ogimage &#38;&#38;
    &#60;meta property=&#34;og:image&#34; content={post.ogimage}&#62;}
  &#60;body&#62;
    &#60;h1&#62;{post.title}&#60;/h1&#62;
    {post.content}

```

I love this because it allows me to leverage existing mechanisms in both the authoring and development processes (data attributes in HTML that become metadata on the `post` object), without needing to introduce an entirely new method of expression (e.g. front-matter).

It also feels good because:

1. **It’s good for me**. It doesn’t require any additional work on my part. I don’t have to create additional images for my posts. I’m merely marking images I’ve already created — which were done in service of a post’s content — as “previews” for the post.
2. **It’s good for users**. Readers of my site get image previews that are actually, well, previews — e.g. a graphical representation that will contextually reappear in the post, (as opposed to an image template whose contents do nothing to provide an advanced graphical preview of what’s to follow in the post itself).

It’s technology in service of content, rather than content in service of technology.

Or at least that’s what I like to tell myself :)

      <source:markdown>Fascinating [blog post](https://www.shellen.com/2025/10/07/layover-over/) from Jason Shellen, tech entrepreneur, formerly with Blogger and Google. Here’s my perspective on part of the story he tells about RSS and Google Reader.

Netscape gave us RSS 0.91 and it was good enough to create a new powerful layer on the web. Then Netscape blew up and a bunch of repeated efforts to kill it from big companies. I’ll leave it to others to say why, but they tried over and over to extinguish the spark. Independent developers were stubborn, we kept using the original format, and in the end the independents prevailed.

Don’t ever think bigco’s are the answer. They almost always suck the life out of open systems. If you have something good going: **work together**. It’s the antidote to bigco dominance.

If you suck up to the bigco thinking they’ll let you in, maybe they will for a short while. But what you’ll be left with may not be worth the cost.

And just because you have a job at a bigco doesn’t make you hot shit. Maybe for a moment.

This theory has a name, it’s described in the [Prisoner’s Dilemma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma), and its lesson applies in tech and in the political disaster the US has become.</source:markdown>

      <title>Vibe engineering</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I feel like <strong>vibe coding</strong> is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">pretty well established now</a> as covering the fast, loose and irresponsible way of building software with AI - entirely prompt-driven, and with no attention paid to how the code actually works. This leaves us with a terminology gap: what should we call the other end of the spectrum, where seasoned professionals accelerate their work with LLMs while staying proudly and confidently accountable for the software they produce?</p>
        <p>I propose we call this <strong>vibe engineering</strong>, with my tongue only partially in my cheek.</p>
        <p>One of the lesser spoken truths of working productively with LLMs as a software engineer on non-toy-projects is that it's <em>difficult</em>. There's a lot of depth to understanding how to use the tools, there are plenty of traps to avoid, and the pace at which they can churn out working code raises the bar for what the human participant can and should be contributing.</p>
        <p>The rise of <strong>coding agents</strong> - tools like <a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> (released February 2025), OpenAI's <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a> (April) and <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">Gemini CLI</a> (June) that can iterate on code, actively testing and modifying it until it achieves a specified goal, has dramatically increased the usefulness of LLMs for real-world coding problems.</p>
        <p>I'm increasingly hearing from experienced, credible software engineers who are running multiple copies of agents at once, tackling several problems in parallel and expanding the scope of what they can take on. I was skeptical of this at first but <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/">I've started running multiple agents myself now</a> and it's surprisingly effective, if mentally exhausting!</p>
        <p>This feels very different from classic vibe coding, where I outsource a simple, low-stakes task to an LLM and accept the result if it appears to work. Most of my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> collection (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/4/highlighted-tools/">previously</a>) were built like that. Iterating with coding agents to produce production-quality code that I'm confident I can maintain in the future feels like a different process entirely.</p>
        <p>It's also become clear to me that LLMs actively reward existing top tier software engineering practices:</p>
        <ul id="techniques">
        <li>
        <strong>Automated testing</strong>. If your project has a robust, comprehensive and stable test suite agentic coding tools can <em>fly</em> with it. Without tests? Your agent might claim something works without having actually tested it at all, plus any new change could break an unrelated feature without you realizing it. Test-first development is particularly effective with agents that can iterate in a loop.</li>
        <li>
        <strong>Planning in advance</strong>. Sitting down to hack something together goes much better if you start with a high level plan. Working with an agent makes this even more important - you can iterate on the plan first, then hand it off to the agent to write the code.</li>
        <li>
        <strong>Comprehensive documentation</strong>. Just like human programmers, an LLM can only keep a subset of the codebase in its context at once. Being able to feed in relevant documentation lets it use APIs from other areas without reading the code first. Write good documentation first and the model may be able to build the matching implementation from that input alone.</li>
        <li>
        <strong>Good version control habits</strong>. Being able to undo mistakes and understand when and how something was changed is even more important when a coding agent might have made the changes. LLMs are also fiercely competent at Git - they can navigate the history themselves to track down the origin of bugs, and they're better than most developers at using <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/git/git-bisect">git bisect</a>. Use that to your advantage.</li>
        <li>Having <strong>effective automation</strong> in place. Continuous integration, automated formatting and linting, continuous deployment to a preview environment - all things that agentic coding tools can benefit from too. LLMs make writing quick automation scripts easier as well, which can help them then repeat tasks accurately and consistently next time.</li>
        <li>A <strong>culture of code review</strong>. This one explains itself. If you're fast and productive at code review you're going to have a much better time working with LLMs than if you'd rather write code yourself than review the same thing written by someone (or something) else.</li>
        <li>A <strong>very weird form of management</strong>. Getting good results out of a coding agent feels uncomfortably close to getting good results out of a human collaborator. You need to provide clear instructions, ensure they have the necessary context and provide actionable feedback on what they produce. It's a <em>lot</em> easier than working with actual people because you don't have to worry about offending or discouraging them - but any existing management experience you have will prove surprisingly useful.</li>
        <li>Really good <strong>manual QA (quality assurance)</strong>. Beyond automated tests, you need to be really good at manually testing software, including predicting and digging into edge-cases.</li>
        <li>Strong <strong>research skills</strong>. There are dozens of ways to solve any given coding problem. Figuring out the best options and proving an approach has always been important, and remains a blocker on unleashing an agent to write the actual code.</li>
        <li>The ability to <strong>ship to a preview environment</strong>. If an agent builds a feature, having a way to safely preview that feature (without deploying it straight to production) makes reviews much more productive and greatly reduces the risk of shipping something broken.</li>
        <li>An instinct for <strong>what can be outsourced</strong> to AI and what you need to manually handle yourself. This is constantly evolving as the models and tools become more effective. A big part of working effectively with LLMs is maintaining a strong intuition for when they can best be applied.</li>
        <li>An updated <strong>sense of estimation</strong>. Estimating how long a project will take has always been one of the hardest but most important parts of being a senior engineer, especially in organizations where budget and strategy decisions are made based on those estimates. AI-assisted coding makes this <em>even harder</em> - things that used to take a long time are much faster, but estimations now depend on new factors which we're all still trying to figure out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're going to really exploit the capabilities of these new tools, you need to be operating <em>at the top of your game</em>. You're not just responsible for writing the code - you're researching approaches, deciding on high-level architecture, writing specifications, defining success criteria, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing agentic loops</a>, planning QA, managing a growing army of weird digital interns who will absolutely cheat if you give them a chance, and spending <em>so much time on code review</em>.</p>
        <p>Almost all of these are characteristics of senior software engineers already!</p>
        <p>AI tools <strong>amplify existing expertise</strong>. The more skills and experience you have as a software engineer the faster and better the results you can get from working with LLMs and coding agents.</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>I feel like **vibe coding** is [pretty well established now](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/) as covering the fast, loose and irresponsible way of building software with AI - entirely prompt-driven, and with no attention paid to how the code actually works. This leaves us with a terminology gap: what should we call the other end of the spectrum, where seasoned professionals accelerate their work with LLMs while staying proudly and confidently accountable for the software they produce?

I propose we call this **vibe engineering**, with my tongue only partially in my cheek.

One of the lesser spoken truths of working productively with LLMs as a software engineer on non-toy-projects is that it&#39;s _difficult_. There&#39;s a lot of depth to understanding how to use the tools, there are plenty of traps to avoid, and the pace at which they can churn out working code raises the bar for what the human participant can and should be contributing.

The rise of **coding agents** \- tools like [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) (released February 2025), OpenAI&#39;s [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (April) and [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (June) that can iterate on code, actively testing and modifying it until it achieves a specified goal, has dramatically increased the usefulness of LLMs for real-world coding problems.

I&#39;m increasingly hearing from experienced, credible software engineers who are running multiple copies of agents at once, tackling several problems in parallel and expanding the scope of what they can take on. I was skeptical of this at first but [I&#39;ve started running multiple agents myself now](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/) and it&#39;s surprisingly effective, if mentally exhausting!

This feels very different from classic vibe coding, where I outsource a simple, low-stakes task to an LLM and accept the result if it appears to work. Most of my [tools.simonwillison.net](https://tools.simonwillison.net/) collection ( [previously](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/4/highlighted-tools/)) were built like that. Iterating with coding agents to produce production-quality code that I&#39;m confident I can maintain in the future feels like a different process entirely.

It&#39;s also become clear to me that LLMs actively reward existing top tier software engineering practices:

- **Automated testing**. If your project has a robust, comprehensive and stable test suite agentic coding tools can _fly_ with it. Without tests? Your agent might claim something works without having actually tested it at all, plus any new change could break an unrelated feature without you realizing it. Test-first development is particularly effective with agents that can iterate in a loop.
- **Planning in advance**. Sitting down to hack something together goes much better if you start with a high level plan. Working with an agent makes this even more important - you can iterate on the plan first, then hand it off to the agent to write the code.
- **Comprehensive documentation**. Just like human programmers, an LLM can only keep a subset of the codebase in its context at once. Being able to feed in relevant documentation lets it use APIs from other areas without reading the code first. Write good documentation first and the model may be able to build the matching implementation from that input alone.
- **Good version control habits**. Being able to undo mistakes and understand when and how something was changed is even more important when a coding agent might have made the changes. LLMs are also fiercely competent at Git - they can navigate the history themselves to track down the origin of bugs, and they&#39;re better than most developers at using [git bisect](https://til.simonwillison.net/git/git-bisect). Use that to your advantage.
- Having **effective automation** in place. Continuous integration, automated formatting and linting, continuous deployment to a preview environment - all things that agentic coding tools can benefit from too. LLMs make writing quick automation scripts easier as well, which can help them then repeat tasks accurately and consistently next time.
- A **culture of code review**. This one explains itself. If you&#39;re fast and productive at code review you&#39;re going to have a much better time working with LLMs than if you&#39;d rather write code yourself than review the same thing written by someone (or something) else.
- A **very weird form of management**. Getting good results out of a coding agent feels uncomfortably close to getting good results out of a human collaborator. You need to provide clear instructions, ensure they have the necessary context and provide actionable feedback on what they produce. It&#39;s a _lot_ easier than working with actual people because you don&#39;t have to worry about offending or discouraging them - but any existing management experience you have will prove surprisingly useful.
- Really good **manual QA (quality assurance)**. Beyond automated tests, you need to be really good at manually testing software, including predicting and digging into edge-cases.
- Strong **research skills**. There are dozens of ways to solve any given coding problem. Figuring out the best options and proving an approach has always been important, and remains a blocker on unleashing an agent to write the actual code.
- The ability to **ship to a preview environment**. If an agent builds a feature, having a way to safely preview that feature (without deploying it straight to production) makes reviews much more productive and greatly reduces the risk of shipping something broken.
- An instinct for **what can be outsourced** to AI and what you need to manually handle yourself. This is constantly evolving as the models and tools become more effective. A big part of working effectively with LLMs is maintaining a strong intuition for when they can best be applied.
- An updated **sense of estimation**. Estimating how long a project will take has always been one of the hardest but most important parts of being a senior engineer, especially in organizations where budget and strategy decisions are made based on those estimates. AI-assisted coding makes this _even harder_ \- things that used to take a long time are much faster, but estimations now depend on new factors which we&#39;re all still trying to figure out.

If you&#39;re going to really exploit the capabilities of these new tools, you need to be operating _at the top of your game_. You&#39;re not just responsible for writing the code - you&#39;re researching approaches, deciding on high-level architecture, writing specifications, defining success criteria, [designing agentic loops](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/), planning QA, managing a growing army of weird digital interns who will absolutely cheat if you give them a chance, and spending _so much time on code review_.

Almost all of these are characteristics of senior software engineers already!

AI tools **amplify existing expertise**. The more skills and experience you have as a software engineer the faster and better the results you can get from working with LLMs and coding agents.

#### &#34;Vibe engineering&#34;, really?

Is this a stupid name? Yeah, probably. &#34;Vibes&#34; as a concept in AI feels a little tired at this point. &#34;Vibe coding&#34; itself is used by a lot of developers in a dismissive way. I&#39;m ready to reclaim vibes for something more constructive.

I&#39;ve never really liked the artificial distinction between &#34;coders&#34; and &#34;engineers&#34; - that&#39;s always smelled to me a bit like gatekeeping. But in this case a bit of gatekeeping is exactly what we need!

**Vibe engineering** establishes a clear distinction from vibe coding. It signals that this is a different, harder and more sophisticated way of working with AI tools to build production software.

I like that this is cheeky and likely to be controversial. This whole space is still absurd in all sorts of different ways. We shouldn&#39;t take ourselves too seriously while we figure out the most productive ways to apply these new tools.

I&#39;ve tried in the past to get terms like **[AI-assisted programming](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/)** to stick, with approximately zero success. May as well try rubbing some vibes on it and see what happens.

I also really like the clear mismatch between &#34;vibes&#34; and &#34;engineering&#34;. It makes the combined term self-contradictory in a way that I find mischievous and (hopefully) sticky.

      <source:markdown>Citizen Lab has [uncovered](https://citizenlab.ca/2025/10/ai-enabled-io-aimed-at-overthrowing-iranian-regime/) a coordinated AI-enabled influence operation against the Iranian government, probably conducted by Israel.

&#62; **Key Findings**
&#62;
&#62; - A coordinated network of more than 50 inauthentic X profiles is conducting an AI-enabled influence operation. The network, which we refer to as “PRISONBREAK,” is spreading narratives inciting Iranian audiences to revolt against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
&#62;
&#62; - While the network was created in 2023, almost all of its activity was conducted starting in January 2025, and continues to the present day.
&#62;
&#62; - The profiles’ activity appears to have been synchronized, at least in part, with the military campaign that the Israel Defense Forces conducted against Iranian targets in June 2025.
