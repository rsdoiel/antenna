## A Funny, Episodic, Historical Novel That We Like

This is the third funny novel we’ve highlighted in the newsletter (the [first](https://buttondown.com/humorouswriting/archive/a-funny-novel-we-like-and-why-it-works-so-well/) and [second](https://buttondown.com/humorouswriting/archive/another-funny-novel-we-love-and-why-it-works-so/) are here) and this is the most absurdist one we’ve discussed so far. Based on a real historical figure, the novel is a series of secondhand stories all set within a parody frame. On the level of joke writing and formal choice, it’s a book that any humor writer looking to work on something longer should look to for inspiration.</source:markdown>

      <title>2025-11-06 Bye bye USA</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-11-06-bye-bye-usa">2025-11-06 Bye bye USA</h1>
        
        <p>I haven&rsquo;t travelled to the US in many years. I made an exception in 2012 because my wife wanted to see <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> again. Before that, I already hadn&rsquo;t travelled to the US in many years. Remember the Snowden years? The Homeland Security years? The Patriot Act years? Remember? They never ended.</p>
        
        <p>These day&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
        
        <p>A friend wanted some advice about moving customer data from on-premise in Switzerland to a US cloud compute provider, nominally in Switzerland. We had a long chat about political pressure and authoritarian governments. I think she challenged her team that is in charge of the long project (you know those projects where you need to answer hundreds of questions in huge Excel sheets) with the question: Would you move this data to a Chinese cloud hosting provider?

      <source:markdown># 2025-11-06 Bye bye USA

I haven’t travelled to the US in many years. I made an exception in 2012 because my wife wanted to see [Hawaii](Hawaii) again. Before that, I already hadn’t travelled to the US in many years. Remember the Snowden years? The Homeland Security years? The Patriot Act years? Remember? They never ended.

These day’s it’s even worse.

A friend wanted some advice about moving customer data from on-premise in Switzerland to a US cloud compute provider, nominally in Switzerland. We had a long chat about political pressure and authoritarian governments. I think she challenged her team that is in charge of the long project (you know those projects where you need to answer hundreds of questions in huge Excel sheets) with the question: Would you move this data to a Chinese cloud hosting provider? Of course not, that’s different, they said. And the two of us wondered for how long.

We talked about Microsoft saying in Paris that the US government would get access to customer data on Microsoft hosts if it really wanted to, even if hosted in Europe; about the International Criminal Court (ICC) ditching Microsoft Office because Microsoft had locked them out of all their services, because the credit card institutes had locked them all out of their services, all at the behest of the US president.

We talked about the Swiss army chief opposing the current move of the federal administration to the Microsoft cloud; the Swiss federal court in Lausanne not using Microsoft as far as possible; the canton of Lucerne suddenly realising what they are are about to give up with a move to Microsoft; about people saying that Switzerland should stop paying for the F-35 after one billion spent since it may or may not arrive if we pay the remaining six billion, and if it does, we don’t know if it’ll work, and if it works, we don’t know if the US president won’t disable them just to make a point.

We talked about Trump and how people are no longer trusting that the US is an ally, a friend, a partner to rely on.

Each example is a small event on the global scale, but together they start building up. If you’re a C-level executive, do you want to be the person that decided handing the company keys to a company in the US, where IT leaders make $1,000,000 presents and kiss the president’s arse at a dinner, on camera? Will they stand up for you? Of course not. Will the heads of the local branches stand up for you? Of course not.

If people can avoid dealing with authoritarian strongmen, they do it. If people start dealing with organised crime, their woes never end.

Switzerland has an app-based electronic payment system called TWINT. I prefer it over Visa and Mastercard. I also want to get back to using a lot of cash. I stopped that with the onset of the pandemic in 2020. But I’m doing my part voting with my wallet.

We distrust China because they’re authoritarians. We distrust Russia because they’re authoritarians. Why should we trust the USA since they’re slowly turning into authoritarians.

        Offsetting is a worldview that insists that problems created by capital

        hall of mirrors. A tree, for example, becomes a fractal, recursive

        hypothetical extra dimensions of space and time. Offsetting is a product
        of last-stage, recursive, data-driven capitalism, and its brilliance is
        that it allows any human activity to be commodified by means of
        measurement, data collection, and computation

        over the crowd to shriek upward-arcing shards — whose strength never

        This article examines the expansion of generative artificial

        credibility by association. Drawing on our experience as faculty in the
        California State University (CSU) system—the first university system to
        contract with OpenAI to provide ChatGPT Edu system-wide—we assess the
        rhetoric that justifies and legitimizes genAI contracts in higher
        education. We suggest that the uncritical adoption of genAI in higher
        education poses problems for labor conditions, the integrity of
        intellectual property, and student learning on campuses, particularly
        under the conditions of austerity that are commonly found in public

        to enjoy the wealth and the freedom of movement one’s citizenship
        confers. But as this country builds more cages for immigrants, deploys
        military force against civilians in city after city, regularly commits

      <source:markdown>These are some things I’ve wandered across on the web this week.

## 🔖 [Orcutt Shelley Miller and the Great American Road Trip](https://www.thetonearm.com/orcutt-shelley-miller-and-the-great-american-road-trip/)

I’m not aware of resuscitating anything, really. I just enjoy playing
and finding new ways to surprise myself. It all happens organically.
There’s not a lot of strategizing that goes into it. There’s no plan. I
love the history of the guitar and of guitar players, so it’s a
conversation I want to be part of.

## 🔖 [Gaza Verified](https://gaza-verified.org/)

We verify, to the best of our abilities, that people who say they’re
Palestinians from Gaza are who they say they are by holding video
conversations with them.

Beyond that, we’re in touch with them daily and trying to help them
raise funds to stay alive.

For more details, please see our guide.

## 🔖 [All that is Air Melts into Air](https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/spatial-computing/592129/all-that-is-air-melts-into-air)

Offsetting is a worldview that insists that problems created by capital
accumulation can only be resolved by further capital accumulation. On a
finite planet, the search for new forms of capital begins to resemble a
hall of mirrors. A tree, for example, becomes a fractal, recursive
commodity, with hidden dimensions of value waiting to be uncurled, like
hypothetical extra dimensions of space and time. Offsetting is a product
of last-stage, recursive, data-driven capitalism, and its brilliance is
that it allows any human activity to be commodified by means of
measurement, data collection, and computation

## 🔖 [FBI Tries to Unmask Owner of Infamous Archive.is Site](https://www.404media.co/fbi-tries-to-unmask-owner-of-infamous-archive-is-site/)

The FBI is attempting to unmask the owner behind archive.today, a
popular archiving site that is also regularly used to bypass paywalls on
the internet and to avoid sending traffic to the original publishers of
web content, according to a subpoena posted by the website. The FBI
subpoena says it is part of a criminal investigation, though it does not
provide any details about what alleged crime is being investigated.
Archive.today is also popularly known by several of its mirrors,
including archive.is and archive.ph.

## 🔖 [Heavy metal is healing teens on the Blackfeet Nation](https://www.hcn.org/issues/57-11/heavy-metal-is-healing-teens-on-the-blackfeet-nation/)

On stage later, beneath an array of a dozen stag skulls, Krieger was
slinking around like a ghostly Indigenous Jim Morrison, windmilling his
waist-length hair, blasting life force through a cedar flute and leaning
over the crowd to shriek upward-arcing shards — whose strength never
flagged during his entire blistering set — as his guitarist crowned his
howls with constellations of tremolo picking. In the mosh pit, one fan
hoisted a buffalo rib the size of a baseball bat, presumably from the
barbecue, like some feral invocation. Blackbraid’s performance may have
converted Daniels, the photographer, to solid metal fandom. But after
Converge, he stood by me and said, “Now I get it.”

## 🔖 [Estimating Carbon Emissions From Income](https://lav.io/notes/carbon-calculations/)

Most individual carbon footprint calculators only factor in consumption.
How many plane trips have you taken this year? How many car miles have
you driven? And so on. And, numerous studies and papers have drawn out
the relationship between individual or household consumption and
emissions. On the other hand, far fewer studies have attempted to
calculate emissions based income.

Is it possible to estimate individual or household emissions based on
income alone, without any consideration for consumption choices?

## 🔖 [Notes on “Nomadology,” Part I (25,000 words)](https://www.patreon.com/posts/notes-on-part-i-142961660)

What follows is my attempt to come to grips as an adult with a
foundational work of theory I’d bought and first tried to get my head
around in late adolescence: Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s
“Nomadology: The War Machine.”

## 🔖 [Announcing Magika 1.0: now faster, smarter, and rebuilt in Rust](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html?m=1)

It is often not feasible to find thousands of real-world samples for
every file type. To overcome this, we turned to generative AI. We
leveraged Gemini to create a high-quality, synthetic training set by
translating existing code and other structured files from one format to
another.

## 🔖 [Six French Movies to Improve Your French](https://theperfectfrench.com/learning-tips/6-french-movies-to-improve-your-french/)

Watching movies and TV is a big part of someone’s French language
journey. Unfortunately, they are not always easy to find but I have the
solution for you! 6 French movies to improve your French that are
available on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

## 🔖 [Frozen DuckLakes for Multi-User, Serverless Data Access](https://ducklake.select/2025/10/24/frozen-ducklake/)

DuckLakes typically consist of two components: the catalog database and
the storage. Obviously, there is no way around having some sort of
storage to represent the data. But can we host a DuckLake without
setting up a catalog database? In this blog post, we’ll show how you can
create a read-only cloud-based DuckLake without a database server. We
call this a “Frozen DuckLake” because it is read-only and has no moving
parts other than a cloud storage system.

## 🔖 [DuckLake: SQL as a Lakehouse Format](https://ducklake.select/2025/05/27/ducklake-01/)

To resolve the fundamental problems of the existing lakehouse
architecture, we have created a new open table format called DuckLake.
DuckLake re-imagines what a “lakehouse” format should look like by
acknowledging two simple truths:

1. Storing data files in open formats on blob storage is a great idea for
   scalability and to prevent lock-in.

2. Managing metadata is a complex and interconnected data management task
   best left to a database management system.


## 🔖 [C’est la Lune qui nous rend humains](https://www.the-hinternet.com/p/cest-la-lune-qui-nous-rend-humains)

À cet égard, pendant la plus grande partie de l’histoire humaine, la
religion et la science n’étaient manifestement que deux dimensions d’une
seule et même entreprise humaine d’ensemble. Et si nous voulons trouver
une force ou une entité singulière qui nous ait engagés sur cette voie,
nous ne pourrions guère faire mieux que de montrer du doigt la Lune.

## 🔖 [pg\_lake](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/pg_lake)

pg\_lake integrates Iceberg and data lake files into Postgres. With the
pg\_lake extensions, you can use Postgres as a stand-alone lakehouse
system that supports transactions and fast queries on Iceberg tables,
and can directly work with raw data files in object stores like S3

## 🔖 [Let Them Eat Large Language Models: Artificial Intelligence and\ Austerity in the Neoliberal University](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6z5pa_v1)

This article examines the expansion of generative artificial
intelligence (genAI) into higher education. We argue that genAI’s
incursion into university systems represents an effort by Silicon Valley
to capture lucrative new markets for their products, as well as enhanced
credibility by association. Drawing on our experience as faculty in the
California State University (CSU) system—the first university system to
contract with OpenAI to provide ChatGPT Edu system-wide—we assess the
rhetoric that justifies and legitimizes genAI contracts in higher
education. We suggest that the uncritical adoption of genAI in higher
education poses problems for labor conditions, the integrity of
intellectual property, and student learning on campuses, particularly
under the conditions of austerity that are commonly found in public
universities.

## 🔖 [How to Be a Good Citizen When Your Country Does Bad Things](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/opinion/israel-dissidents.html)

When your country pursues abhorrent policies, when the face it turns to
the world is the face of a monster, what does that say about you? In my
experience, it is strikingly easy to shrug off one’s responsibility for
the country where one pays taxes, contributes to the public conversation
and, at least nominally, has the right to vote, if that country is the
United States. It seems one can just say “Not in my name” and continue
to enjoy the wealth and the freedom of movement one’s citizenship
confers. But as this country builds more cages for immigrants, deploys
military force against civilians in city after city, regularly commits
murder in the high seas and systematically destroys its own democratic
institutions, that may change. It should change. What does one do then?
How can one be a good citizen of a bad state

## 🔖 [Louvre Robbery: Security Flaws: The (Obviously) Password Was “Louvre”](https://www.unionesarda.it/en/world/louvre-robbery-security-flaws-the-obviously-password-was-quot-louvrequot-ft1kkp6c)

A “weak” password could become one of the symbols of the Louvre’s
security flaws. According to 2014 documents obtained by Libération,
accessing the museum’s video surveillance server required typing the
all-too-obvious word: LOUVRE .

## 🔖 [SEDA \|\ Standard d’Echange de Données pour l’Archivage](https://github.com/culturegouv/seda/)

Le standard d’échange de données pour l’archivage (SEDA) vise à
faciliter l’interopérabilité entre le système d’information d’un service
d’archives et les systèmes d’information de ses partenaires dans le
cadre de leurs échanges de données.

ProfileGenAPP est un éditeur visuel pour créer des profils d’archivage
SEDA 2.1+ au format RelaxNG. Cette documentation présente les
principales fonctionnalités disponibles dans l’interface utilisateur.

## 🔖 [The\ Authoritarian Stack](https://www.authoritarian-stack.info/)

Under the banner of “patriotic tech”, this new bloc is building the
infrastructure of control—clouds, AI, finance, drones, satellites—an
integrated system we call the Authoritarian Stack. It is faster,
ideological, and fully privatized: a regime where corporate boards, not
public law, set the rules.

## 🔖 [Nametree](https://nametree.oo8.be/)

What is that? An online app to make diagrams for the names of your loved
ones, non-humans and humans. Why? Because nobody has just one name

## 🔖 [Dane Stuckey (OpenAI CISO) on prompt injection risks for ChatGPT Atlas](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/)

My biggest complaint about the launch of the ChatGPT Atlas browser the

The BitTorrent protocol is a p2p protocol for distributing data

The manual includes some beautiful exploded view diagrams for repair.

## 🔖 [(](https://social.eurybia.osx.ninja/@logistics) [**logistics?**](\#ref-logistics))( [**social.eurybia.osx.ninja?**](\#ref-social.eurybia.osx.ninja))

Taking inspiration from ( [**2001?**](#ref-2001)), this account is

        <p>Note that it DID think about SVG creation, but then decided it should look at the current directory. This isn't what I want - it appeared to be running in Codex's normal mode with a system prompt telling it to edit files on disk. I wanted it to respond to the prompt without acting as if it had a full workspace available to it.</p>
        <p>I prompted it again, pasting in the broken output:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>this did not seem to work - here is what happened - note that the reasoning summary comes out on a lot of lines when I would rather it streams out to stderr on the same line (flushing constantly) - and then despite the reasoning summary thinking about pelican on SVG it did not actually act on that and display the result, which is very surprising. [pasted content]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It churned for a bit more, but from the output it looked like it was still trying to include Codex-specific tools and workspace information. So I said:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Note that this new 'codex prompt' command should NOT be able to execute any tools at all, and should not have to think about the workspace or sandbox - it should send a single prompt with no tools and then stream and display a response and then stop.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This got me a new build, but when I ran it:</p>
        <pre><code>Error: unexpected status 400 Bad Request: {"detail":"Instructions are not valid"}
        </code></pre>
        <p>My guess is that OpenAI's custom backend API for Codex doesn't like it if you attempt to call it <em>without</em> passing in the expected instructions. Fair enough!</p>
        <p>Rather than paste that error in I got Codex to try the command itself, so it could see the error:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>You try running this and see what happens: ./target/debug/codex prompt 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle'</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Codex switched back to the default instructions. From its reply:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>cli/src/prompt_cmd.rs#L1-L320</code> now forces a tool-free request: we keep the workspace defaults, inject a lightweight system/developer message (“don’t run tools”), disable apply_patch/web search via config overrides, and build the outbound prompt as just that system span plus the user text.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I guess that will have to do. I asked for one more feature:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Add a --debug option to the codex prompt command which causes the full JSON request and response to be printed to stderr, plus the URL that is being accessed and the HTTP verb</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>... and we're ready to try this thing out!</p>
        <p>Notably I haven't written a single line of Rust myself here and paid almost no attention to what it was actually doing. My main contribution was to run the binary every now and then to see if it was doing what I needed yet.</p>
        <p>I've pushed the working code to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/codex/compare/a47181e471b6efe55e95f9858c913fc89a3a44fa...ae5f98a9248a8edb5d3c53261273a482fc0b5306">a prompt-subcommand branch in my repo</a> if you want to take a look and see how it all works.</p>
        
        <h4 id="let-s-draw-some-pelicans">Let's draw some pelicans</h4>
        <p>With the final version of the code built, I drew some pelicans. Here's the <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?a11f9ac456d2b2bc3715ba900ef1203d">full terminal transcript</a>, but here are some highlights.</p>
        <p>This is with the default GPT-5-Codex model:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./target/debug/codex prompt <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre></div>
        <p>I pasted it into my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render">tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render</a> tool and got the following:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/codex-hacking-default.png" alt="It's a dumpy little pelican with a weird face, not particularly great" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>I ran it again for GPT-5:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./target/debug/codex prompt <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> -m gpt-5</pre></div>

        <p>And now the moment of truth... GPT-5 Codex Mini!</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./target/debug/codex prompt <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> -m gpt-5-codex-mini</pre></div>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>OpenAI partially released a new model yesterday called GPT-5-Codex-Mini, which they [describe](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1986861734619947305) as &#34;a more compact and cost-efficient version of GPT-5-Codex&#34;. It&#39;s currently only available via their Codex CLI tool and VS Code extension, with proper API access &#34; [coming soon](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1986861736041853368)&#34;. I decided to use Codex to reverse engineer the Codex CLI tool and give me the ability to prompt the new model directly.

I made [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o1_DL9uNlM) talking through my progress and demonstrating the final results.

- [Bonus: the --debug option](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/9/gpt-5-codex-mini/#bonus-the-debug-option)

#### This is a little bit cheeky

OpenAI clearly don&#39;t intend for people to access this model directly just yet. It&#39;s available exclusively through Codex CLI which is a privileged application - it gets to access a special backend API endpoint that&#39;s not publicly documented, and it uses a special authentication mechanism that bills usage directly to the user&#39;s existing ChatGPT account.

I figured reverse-engineering that API directly would be somewhat impolite. But... Codex CLI is an open source project released under an Apache 2.0 license. How about upgrading that to let me run my own prompts through its existing API mechanisms instead?

This felt like a somewhat absurd loophole, and I couldn&#39;t resist trying it out and seeing what happened.

#### Codex CLI is written in Rust

The [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) repository contains the source code for the Codex CLI tool, which OpenAI rewrote in Rust just a few months ago.

I don&#39;t know much Rust at all.

I made my own clone on GitHub and checked it out locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:simonw/codex
cd codex
```

Then I fired up Codex itself (in dangerous mode, because I like living dangerously):

```
codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
```

And ran this prompt:

&#62; Figure out how to build the rust version of this tool and then build it

This worked. It churned away for a bit and figured out how to build itself. This is a useful starting point for a project like this - in figuring out the compile step the coding agent gets seeded with a little bit of relevant information about the project, and if it can compile that means it can later partially test the code it is writing while it works.

Once the compile had succeeded I fed it the design for the new feature I wanted:

&#62; Add a new sub-command to the Rust tool called &#34;codex prompt&#34;
&#62;
&#62; codex prompt &#34;prompt goes here&#34; - this runs the given prompt directly against the OpenAI API that Codex uses, with the same code path and authentication credentials as the rest of Codex.
&#62;
&#62; codex prompt -m &#60;model\_name&#62; &#34;prompt goes here&#34; - same again but lets you set the model
&#62;
&#62; codex prompt &#34;prompt goes here&#34; -s/--system &#34;system prompt goes here&#34; - runs with a custom system/developer message
&#62;
&#62; codex prompt --models - this lists all available models that can be used with the &#34;codex prompt&#34; command

My design for this new sub-command is lifted directly from my own [llm command](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-prompt-help).

#### Iterating on the code

Codex got to work. I&#39;ve [shared the full transcript here](https://gistpreview.github.io/?ddabbff092bdd658e06d8a2e8f142098) (using the tool [I described here](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/)), but this TODO list it made itself is a useful summary of what it decided to do:

```
Updated Plan
└ ✔ Inspect CLI structure and relevant core utilities for sending prompts and listing models
  ✔ Implement new `codex prompt` subcommand (CLI plumbing + command handler)
  ✔ Format, lint, and test (`just fmt`, `just fix -p codex-cli`, `cargo test -p codex-cli`)

```

I like that it figured out [the justfile](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/a47181e471b6efe55e95f9858c913fc89a3a44fa/codex-rs/justfile) in the repo and decided to use it to run formatting and linting commands without me needing to tell it to. (Update: it turns out that was dictated by the [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/f8b30af6dc275b3e64de5f1987e6cafe604cb72a/AGENTS.md) file.)

I tried running the first version of the code it wrote like this:

```
./target/debug/codex prompt &#39;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&#39; -m gpt-5-codex-mini
```

... and it didn&#39;t quite work. I got this:

```

Token usage: total=2459 input=2374 cached_input=0 output=85 reasoning_output=64

```

Note that it DID think about SVG creation, but then decided it should look at the current directory. This isn&#39;t what I want - it appeared to be running in Codex&#39;s normal mode with a system prompt telling it to edit files on disk. I wanted it to respond to the prompt without acting as if it had a full workspace available to it.

I prompted it again, pasting in the broken output:

&#62; this did not seem to work - here is what happened - note that the reasoning summary comes out on a lot of lines when I would rather it streams out to stderr on the same line (flushing constantly) - and then despite the reasoning summary thinking about pelican on SVG it did not actually act on that and display the result, which is very surprising. \[pasted content\]

It churned for a bit more, but from the output it looked like it was still trying to include Codex-specific tools and workspace information. So I said:

&#62; Note that this new &#39;codex prompt&#39; command should NOT be able to execute any tools at all, and should not have to think about the workspace or sandbox - it should send a single prompt with no tools and then stream and display a response and then stop.

This got me a new build, but when I ran it:

```
Error: unexpected status 400 Bad Request: {&#34;detail&#34;:&#34;Instructions are not valid&#34;}

```

My guess is that OpenAI&#39;s custom backend API for Codex doesn&#39;t like it if you attempt to call it _without_ passing in the expected instructions. Fair enough!

Rather than paste that error in I got Codex to try the command itself, so it could see the error:

&#62; You try running this and see what happens: ./target/debug/codex prompt &#39;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&#39;

Codex switched back to the default instructions. From its reply:

&#62; `cli/src/prompt_cmd.rs#L1-L320` now forces a tool-free request: we keep the workspace defaults, inject a lightweight system/developer message (“don’t run tools”), disable apply\_patch/web search via config overrides, and build the outbound prompt as just that system span plus the user text.

I guess that will have to do. I asked for one more feature:

&#62; Add a --debug option to the codex prompt command which causes the full JSON request and response to be printed to stderr, plus the URL that is being accessed and the HTTP verb

... and we&#39;re ready to try this thing out!

Notably I haven&#39;t written a single line of Rust myself here and paid almost no attention to what it was actually doing. My main contribution was to run the binary every now and then to see if it was doing what I needed yet.

I&#39;ve pushed the working code to [a prompt-subcommand branch in my repo](https://github.com/simonw/codex/compare/a47181e471b6efe55e95f9858c913fc89a3a44fa...ae5f98a9248a8edb5d3c53261273a482fc0b5306) if you want to take a look and see how it all works.

#### Let&#39;s draw some pelicans

With the final version of the code built, I drew some pelicans. Here&#39;s the [full terminal transcript](https://gistpreview.github.io/?a11f9ac456d2b2bc3715ba900ef1203d), but here are some highlights.

This is with the default GPT-5-Codex model:

```
./target/debug/codex prompt &#34;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&#34;
```

I pasted it into my [tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render](https://tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render) tool and got the following:

![It&#39;s a dumpy little pelican with a weird face, not particularly great](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/codex-hacking-default.png)

I ran it again for GPT-5:

```
./target/debug/codex prompt &#34;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&#34; -m gpt-5
```

![Much better bicycle, pelican is a bit line-drawing-ish but does have the necessary parts in the right places](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/codex-hacking-gpt-5.png)

And now the moment of truth... GPT-5 Codex Mini!

```
./target/debug/codex prompt &#34;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&#34; -m gpt-5-codex-mini
```

![This is terrible. The pelican is an abstract collection of shapes, the bicycle is likewise very messed up](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/codex-hacking-mini.png)

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be adding that one to my SVG drawing toolkit any time soon.

#### Bonus: the --debug option

I had Codex add a `--debug` option to help me see exactly what was going on.

```
./target/debug/codex prompt -m gpt-5-codex-mini &#34;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&#34; --debug
```

The output starts like this:

```
[codex prompt debug] POST https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses
[codex prompt debug] Request JSON:

```

```

}
```

This reveals that OpenAI&#39;s private API endpoint for Codex CLI is `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`.

Also interesting is how the `&#34;instructions&#34;` key (truncated above, [full copy here](https://gist.github.com/simonw/996388ecf785ad54de479315bd4d33b7)) contains the default instructions, without which the API appears not to work - but it also shows that you can send a message with `role=&#34;developer&#34;` in advance of your user prompt.

      <source:markdown>&#62; The big advantage of MCP over OpenAPI is that it is very clear about auth. \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; Maybe an agent could read the docs and write code to auth. But we don&#39;t actually want that, because it implies the agent gets access to the API token! We want the agent&#39;s harness to handle that and never reveal the key to the agent. \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; OAuth has always assumed that the client knows what API it&#39;s talking to, and so the client&#39;s developer can register the client with that API in advance to get a client\_id/client\_secret pair. Agents, though, don&#39;t know what MCPs they&#39;ll talk to in advance.
&#62;
&#62; So MCP [requires OAuth dynamic client registration](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization#dynamic-client-registration) ( [RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)), which practically nobody actually implemented prior to MCP. DCR might as well have been introduced by MCP, and may actually be the most important unlock in the whole spec.

        This new release of Mastodon adds two of my most desired features!</p>
        <p>The first is support for quote posts. This had already become an unofficial feature in the client apps I was using (<a href="https://phanpy.social/">phanpy.social</a> on the web and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274">Ivory</a> on iOS) but now it's officially part of Mastodon's core platform.</p>

        <blockquote>

        <p>Users on servers running 4.4 and earlier versions have likely experienced the confusion of seeing replies appearing on other servers but not their own. Mastodon 4.5 automatically checks for missing replies upon page load and again every 15 minutes, enhancing continuity of conversations across the Fediverse.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The absolute worst thing about Mastodon - especially if you run on your own independent server - is that the nature of the platform means you can't be guaranteed to see every reply to a post your are viewing that originated on another instance (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Sep/16/notes-on-using-a-single-person-mastodon-server/">previously</a>).</p>
        <p>This leads to an unpleasant reply-guy effect where you find yourself replying to a post saying the exact same thing that everyone else said... because you didn't see any of the other replies before you posted!</p>
        <p>Mastodon 4.5 finally solves this problem!</p>

      <source:markdown>**[Mastodon 4.5](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/11/mastodon-4.5/)**

This new release of Mastodon adds two of my most desired features!

The first is support for quote posts. This had already become an unofficial feature in the client apps I was using ( [phanpy.social](https://phanpy.social/) on the web and [Ivory](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274) on iOS) but now it&#39;s officially part of Mastodon&#39;s core platform.

Much more notably though:

&#62; **Fetch All Replies: Completing the Conversation Flow**
&#62;
&#62; Users on servers running 4.4 and earlier versions have likely experienced the confusion of seeing replies appearing on other servers but not their own. Mastodon 4.5 automatically checks for missing replies upon page load and again every 15 minutes, enhancing continuity of conversations across the Fediverse.

The absolute worst thing about Mastodon - especially if you run on your own independent server - is that the nature of the platform means you can&#39;t be guaranteed to see every reply to a post your are viewing that originated on another instance ( [previously](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Sep/16/notes-on-using-a-single-person-mastodon-server/)).

This leads to an unpleasant reply-guy effect where you find yourself replying to a post saying the exact same thing that everyone else said... because you didn&#39;t see any of the other replies before you posted!

Mastodon 4.5 finally solves this problem!

I went looking for the GitHub issue about this and found [this one that quoted my complaint about this](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/22674) from December 2022, which is marked as a duplicate of this [Fetch whole conversation threads issue](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/9409) from 2018.

So happy to see this finally resolved.

        <![CDATA[<p>Over the years, I’ve been chewing on media related to nuclear weapons. This is my high-level, non-exhaustive documentation of my consumption — with links!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>📖 <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-richard-rhodes/51031e8da01f5db9" ><em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a> by Richard Rhodes.<ul>
        <li>This is one of those definitive histories (it’s close to 1,000 pages and won a Pulitzer Prize). It starts with the early discoveries in physics, like the splitting of the atom, and goes up to the end of WWII. I really enjoyed this one. A definite recommendation.</li>
        <li>📖 <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/dark-sun-the-making-of-the-hydrogen-bomb-richard-rhodes/f02fca9831d3aaae" ><em>Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb</em></a> by Richard Rhodes is the sequel. If you want to know how we went from atomic weapons to thermonuclear ones, I think this one will do it. It was a harder read for me though. It got into a lot of the politics and espionage of the Cold War and I fizzled out on it (plus my library copy had to be returned, somebody else had it on hold). I’ll probably go pick it up again though and finish it — eventually.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>📖 <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-bomb-a-life-gerard-j-degroot/10871591" ><em>The Bomb: A Life</em></a> by Gerard J. DeGroot<ul>
        <li>This one piqued my interest because it covers more history of the bomb after its first use, including the testing that took place in Nevada not far from where I grew up. Having had a few different friends growing up whose parents died of cancer that was attributed to being “downwinders” this part of the book hit close to home. Which reminds me of:</li>
        <li>🎥 <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/downwinders-and-radioactive-west/" ><em>Downwinders &amp; The Radioactive West</em></a> from PBS. Again, growing up amongst locals who saw some of the flashes of light from the tests and experienced the fallout come down in their towns, this doc hit close to home.

      <source:markdown>Converting hot dog plasma video to sound with OpenCV

When you ground a hot dog to an AM radio tower, it generates plasma.


Your browser does not support the video tag.

While the hot dog&#39;s flesh is getting vaporized, a tiny plasma arc moves the air around it back and forth. And because this tower is an AM tower, it uses [_Amplitude_ Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation), where a transmitter changes the amplitude of a carrier wave up and down. Just like a speaker cone moving up and down, the plasma arc from the hot dog turns that modulation into audible sound.

      <title>Could LLMs encourage new programming languages?</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/7/llms-for-new-programming-languages/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>My hunch is that existing LLMs make it <em>easier</em> to build a new programming language in a way that captures new developers.</p>
        <p>Most programming languages are similar enough to existing languages that you only need to know a small number of details to use them: what's the core syntax for variables, loops, conditionals and functions? How does memory management work? What's the concurrency model?</p>
        <p>For many languages you can fit all of that, including illustrative examples, in a few thousand tokens of text.</p>
        <p>So ship your new programming language with a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">Claude Skills style document</a> and give your early adopters the ability to write it with LLMs. The LLMs should handle that very well, especially if they get to run an agentic loop against a compiler or even a linter that you provide.</p>

Switzerland is slowly about to find out that you can’t buy the climate with money.

&#62; Commissioned by the Swiss federal government and compiled by MeteoSwiss, the new scenarios build on the results of the 2018 climate scenarios. They confirm and expand on the picture that had already emerged regarding climate change in Switzerland. The warming in Switzerland until now (2024: 2.9 °C up on pre-industrial levels) is above the global average (2024: up 1.3 °C). Aspects of climate change are proving more pronounced for Switzerland than the mean situation worldwide, partly due to the country’s geographical location. In an overall global warming scenario of 3 °C, the temperature in Switzerland is expected to rise significantly more than that, by around 4.9 °C. – [Climate change particularly pronounced in Switzerland](https://www.news.admin.ch/en/newnsb/COnEkDbkoyff3Q632k9kk), a press release, by the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss

I bet half the population now thinks that maybe the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is not such a bad thing since it’ll cool Europe, right?

It takes a little bit of work to configure but the result is I can now use Codex CLI on my laptop anywhere in the world against a self-hosted model.

I used it to build [this space invaders clone](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-oss-120b-invaders.html).

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/kimi-k2-thinking/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking">Kimi K2 Thinking</a></strong></p>
        Chinese AI lab Moonshot's Kimi K2 established itself as one of the largest open weight models - 1 trillion parameters - <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/11/kimi-k2/">back in July</a>. They've now released the Thinking version, also a trillion parameters (MoE, 32B active) and also under their custom modified (so <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/11/kimi-k2/#kimi-license">not quite open source</a>) MIT license.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Starting with Kimi K2, we built it as a thinking agent that reasons step-by-step while dynamically invoking tools. It sets a new state-of-the-art on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), BrowseComp, and other benchmarks by dramatically scaling multi-step reasoning depth and maintaining stable tool-use across 200–300 sequential calls. At the same time, K2 Thinking is a native INT4 quantization model with 256k context window, achieving lossless reductions in inference latency and GPU memory usage.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This one is only 594GB on Hugging Face - Kimi K2 was 1.03TB - which I think is due to the new INT4 quantization. This makes the model both cheaper and faster to host.</p>
        <p>So far the only people hosting it are Moonshot themselves. I tried it out both via <a href="https://platform.moonshot.ai">their own API</a> and via <a href="https://openrouter.ai/moonshotai/kimi-k2-thinking/providers">the OpenRouter proxy to it</a>, via the <a href="https://github.com/ghostofpokemon/llm-moonshot">llm-moonshot</a> plugin (by NickMystic) and my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a> plugin respectively.</p>
        <p>The buzz around this model so far is very positive. Could this be the first open weight model that's competitive with the latest from OpenAI and Anthropic, especially for long-running agentic tool call sequences?</p>
        <p>Moonshot AI's <a href="https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/thinking.html">self-reported benchmark scores</a> show K2 Thinking beating the top OpenAI and Anthropic models (GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5 Thinking) at "Agentic Reasoning" and "Agentic Search" but not quite top for "Coding":</p>

      <source:markdown>**[Kimi K2 Thinking](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking)**

Chinese AI lab Moonshot&#39;s Kimi K2 established itself as one of the largest open weight models - 1 trillion parameters - [back in July](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/11/kimi-k2/). They&#39;ve now released the Thinking version, also a trillion parameters (MoE, 32B active) and also under their custom modified (so [not quite open source](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/11/kimi-k2/#kimi-license)) MIT license.

&#62; Starting with Kimi K2, we built it as a thinking agent that reasons step-by-step while dynamically invoking tools. It sets a new state-of-the-art on Humanity&#39;s Last Exam (HLE), BrowseComp, and other benchmarks by dramatically scaling multi-step reasoning depth and maintaining stable tool-use across 200–300 sequential calls. At the same time, K2 Thinking is a native INT4 quantization model with 256k context window, achieving lossless reductions in inference latency and GPU memory usage.

This one is only 594GB on Hugging Face - Kimi K2 was 1.03TB - which I think is due to the new INT4 quantization. This makes the model both cheaper and faster to host.

So far the only people hosting it are Moonshot themselves. I tried it out both via [their own API](https://platform.moonshot.ai) and via [the OpenRouter proxy to it](https://openrouter.ai/moonshotai/kimi-k2-thinking/providers), via the [llm-moonshot](https://github.com/ghostofpokemon/llm-moonshot) plugin (by NickMystic) and my [llm-openrouter](https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter) plugin respectively.

The buzz around this model so far is very positive. Could this be the first open weight model that&#39;s competitive with the latest from OpenAI and Anthropic, especially for long-running agentic tool call sequences?

Moonshot AI&#39;s [self-reported benchmark scores](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/thinking.html) show K2 Thinking beating the top OpenAI and Anthropic models (GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5 Thinking) at &#34;Agentic Reasoning&#34; and &#34;Agentic Search&#34; but not quite top for &#34;Coding&#34;:

I ran a couple of pelican tests:

```
llm install llm-moonshot
llm keys set moonshot # paste key
llm -m moonshot/kimi-k2-thinking &#39;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&#39;

```

![Sonnet 4.5 described this as: Cartoon illustration of a white duck or goose with an orange beak and gray wings riding a bicycle with a red frame and light blue wheels against a light blue background.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/k2-thinking.png)

```
llm install llm-openrouter
llm keys set openrouter # paste key
llm -m openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2-thinking \
  &#39;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&#39;

```

Artificial Analysis [said](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1986541785511043536):

&#62; Kimi K2 Thinking achieves 93% in 𝜏²-Bench Telecom, an agentic tool use benchmark where the model acts as a customer service agent. This is the highest score we have independently measured. Tool use in long horizon agentic contexts was a strength of Kimi K2 Instruct and it appears this new Thinking variant makes substantial gains

CNBC quoted a source who [provided the training price](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/alibaba-backed-moonshot-releases-new-ai-model-kimi-k2-thinking.html) for the model:

&#62; The Kimi K2 Thinking model cost $4.6 million to train, according to a source familiar with the matter. \[...\] CNBC was unable to independently verify the DeepSeek or Kimi figures.

MLX developer Awni Hannun [got it working](https://x.com/awnihannun/status/1986601104130646266) on two 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studios:

&#62; The new 1 Trillion parameter Kimi K2 Thinking model runs well on 2 M3 Ultras in its native format - no loss in quality!
&#62;
&#62; The model was quantization aware trained (qat) at int4.
&#62;
&#62; Here it generated ~3500 tokens at 15 toks/sec using pipeline-parallelism in mlx-lm

Here&#39;s [the 658GB mlx-community model](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Kimi-K2-Thinking).

      <title>Video + notes on upgrading a Datasette plugin for the latest 1.0 alpha, with help from uv and OpenAI Codex CLI</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/upgrading-datasette-plugins/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I'm upgrading various plugins for compatibility with the new <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/4/datasette-10a20/">Datasette 1.0a20 alpha release</a> and I decided to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy4ci7AoF9Y">a video</a> of the process. This post accompanies that video with detailed additional notes.</p>
        
        <p><lite-youtube videoid="qy4ci7AoF9Y" js-api="js-api" title="My process for upgrading Datasette plugins with uv and OpenAI Codex CLI" playlabel="Play: My process for upgrading Datasette plugins with uv and OpenAI Codex CLI"> </lite-youtube></p>
        
        <h4 id="the-datasette-checkbox-plugin">The datasette-checkbox plugin</h4>
        <p>I picked a very simple plugin to illustrate the upgrade process (possibly too simple). <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-checkbox">datasette-checkbox</a> adds just one feature to Datasette: if you are viewing a table with boolean columns (detected as integer columns with names like <code>is_active</code> or <code>has_attachments</code> or <code>should_notify</code>) <em>and</em> your current user has permission to update rows in that table it adds an inline checkbox UI that looks like this:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/datasette-checkbox.gif" alt="Animated demo of a table with name, is_done, should_be_deleted and is_happy columns. Each column has checkboxes, and clicking a checkboxflashes a little &quot;updated&quot; message." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>I built the first version with the help of Claude back in August 2024 - details <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-checkbox/issues/1#issuecomment-2294168693">in this issue comment</a>.</p>
        <p>Most of the implementation is JavaScript that makes calls to Datasette 1.0's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/2/datasette-write-api/">JSON write API</a>. The Python code just checks that the user has the necessary permissions before including the extra JavaScript.</p>
        <h4 id="running-the-plugin-s-tests">Running the plugin's tests</h4>
        <p>The first step in upgrading any plugin is to run its tests against the latest Datasette version.</p>
        <p>Thankfully <code>uv</code> makes it easy to run code in scratch virtual environments that include the different code versions you want to test against.</p>
        <p>I have a test utility called <code>tadd</code> (for "test against development Datasette") which I use for that purpose. I can run it in any plugin directory like this:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>tadd</pre></div>
        <p>And it will run the existing plugin tests against whatever version of Datasette I have checked out in my <code>~/dev/datasette</code> directory.</p>
        <p>You can see the full implementation of <code>tadd</code> (and its friend <code>radd</code> described below) <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/python/uv-tests#variants-tadd-and-radd">in this TIL</a> - the basic version looks like this:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#!</span>/bin/sh</span>
        uv run --no-project --isolated \
          --with-editable <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>.[test]<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> --with-editable <span class="pl-k">~</span>/dev/datasette \
          python -m pytest <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span><span class="pl-smi">$@</span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre></div>
        <p>I started by running <code>tadd</code> in the <code>datasette-checkbox</code> directory, and got my first failure... but it wasn't due to permissions, it was because the <code>pyproject.toml</code> for the plugin was <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-checkbox/blob/0.1a3/pyproject.toml#L13C1-L15C2">pinned</a> to a specific mismatched version of Datasette:</p>

      <source:markdown>I&#39;m upgrading various plugins for compatibility with the new [Datasette 1.0a20 alpha release](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/4/datasette-10a20/) and I decided to record [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy4ci7AoF9Y) of the process. This post accompanies that video with detailed additional notes.

#### The datasette-checkbox plugin

I picked a very simple plugin to illustrate the upgrade process (possibly too simple). [datasette-checkbox](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-checkbox) adds just one feature to Datasette: if you are viewing a table with boolean columns (detected as integer columns with names like `is_active` or `has_attachments` or `should_notify`) _and_ your current user has permission to update rows in that table it adds an inline checkbox UI that looks like this:

![Animated demo of a table with name, is_done, should_be_deleted and is_happy columns. Each column has checkboxes, and clicking a checkboxflashes a little &#34;updated&#34; message.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/datasette-checkbox.gif)

I built the first version with the help of Claude back in August 2024 - details [in this issue comment](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-checkbox/issues/1#issuecomment-2294168693).

Most of the implementation is JavaScript that makes calls to Datasette 1.0&#39;s [JSON write API](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/2/datasette-write-api/). The Python code just checks that the user has the necessary permissions before including the extra JavaScript.

#### Running the plugin&#39;s tests

The first step in upgrading any plugin is to run its tests against the latest Datasette version.

Thankfully `uv` makes it easy to run code in scratch virtual environments that include the different code versions you want to test against.

I have a test utility called `tadd` (for &#34;test against development Datasette&#34;) which I use for that purpose. I can run it in any plugin directory like this:

```
tadd
```

And it will run the existing plugin tests against whatever version of Datasette I have checked out in my `~/dev/datasette` directory.

You can see the full implementation of `tadd` (and its friend `radd` described below) [in this TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/uv-tests#variants-tadd-and-radd) \- the basic version looks like this:

```
#!/bin/sh
uv run --no-project --isolated \
  --with-editable &#39;.[test]&#39; --with-editable ~/dev/datasette \
  python -m pytest &#34;$@&#34;
```

I started by running `tadd` in the `datasette-checkbox` directory, and got my first failure... but it wasn&#39;t due to permissions, it was because the `pyproject.toml` for the plugin was [pinned](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-checkbox/blob/0.1a3/pyproject.toml#L13C1-L15C2) to a specific mismatched version of Datasette:

```
dependencies = [
    &#34;datasette==1.0a19&#34;
]
```

I fixed this problem by swapping `==` to `&#62;=` and ran the tests again... and they passed! Which was a problem because I was expecting permission-related failures.

It turns out when I first wrote the plugin I was [lazy with the tests](https://github.com/datasette/datasette-checkbox/blob/0.1a3/tests/test_checkbox.py) \- they weren&#39;t actually confirming that the table page loaded without errors.

I needed to actually run the code myself to see the expected bug.

First I created myself a demo database using [sqlite-utils create-table](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#creating-tables):

```
sqlite-utils create-table demo.db \
  demo id integer is_checked integer --pk id
```

Then I ran it with Datasette against the plugin&#39;s code like so:

```
radd demo.db
```

Sure enough, visiting `/demo/demo` produced a 500 error about the missing `Datasette.permission_allowed()` method.

The next step was to update the test to also trigger this error:

```
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_plugin_adds_javascript():
    datasette = Datasette()
    db = datasette.add_memory_database(&#34;demo&#34;)
    await db.execute_write(
        &#34;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, is_active INTEGER)&#34;
    )
    await datasette.invoke_startup()
    response = await datasette.client.get(&#34;/demo/test&#34;)
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

And now `tadd` fails as expected.

#### Upgrading the plugin with Codex

It this point I could have manually fixed the plugin itself - which would likely have been faster given the small size of the fix - but instead I demonstrated a bash one-liner I&#39;ve been using to apply these kinds of changes automatically:

```
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
&#34;Run the command tadd and look at the errors and then
read ~/dev/datasette/docs/upgrade-1.0a20.md and apply
fixes and run the tests again and get them to pass&#34;
```

`codex exec` runs OpenAI Codex in non-interactive mode - it will loop until it has finished the prompt you give it.

I tell it to consult the subset of the [Datasette upgrade documentation](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/upgrade_guide.html#datasette-1-0a20-plugin-upgrade-guide) that talks about Datasette permissions and then get the `tadd` command to pass its tests.

This is an example of what I call [designing agentic loops](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/) \- I gave Codex the tools it needed ( `tadd`) and a clear goal and let it get to work on my behalf.

The remainder of the video covers finishing up the work - testing the fix manually, commiting my work using:

```
git commit -a -m &#34;$(basename &#34;$PWD&#34;) for datasette&#62;=1.0a20&#34; \
  -m &#34;Refs https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2577&#34;
```

Then shipping a [0.1a4 release](https://pypi.org/project/datasette-checkbox/0.1a4/) to PyPI using the pattern [described in this TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/pypi/pypi-releases-from-github).
Finally, I demonstrated that the shipped plugin worked in a fresh environment using `uvx` like this:

```
uvx --prerelease=allow --with datasette-checkbox \
  datasette --root ~/dev/ecosystem/datasette-checkbox/demo.db
```

Executing this command installs and runs a fresh Datasette instance with a fresh copy of the new alpha plugin ( `--prerelease=allow`). It&#39;s a neat way of confirming that freshly released software works as expected.

#### A colophon for the video

This video was shot in a single take using [Descript](https://www.descript.com/), with no rehearsal and perilously little preparation in advance. I recorded through my AirPods and applied the &#34;Studio Sound&#34; filter to clean up the audio. I pasted in a `simonwillison.net` closing slide from [my previous video](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/) and exported it locally at 1080p, then uploaded it to YouTube.

Something I learned from the Software Carpentry [instructor training course](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/26/weeknotes-software-carpentry-sqlite/) is that making mistakes in front of an audience is actively helpful - it helps them see a realistic version of how software development works and they can learn from watching you recover. I see this as a great excuse for not editing out all of my mistakes!

I&#39;m trying to build new habits around video content that let me produce useful videos while minimizing the amount of time I spend on production.

I plan to iterate more on the format as I get more comfortable with the process. I&#39;m hoping I can find the right balance between production time and value to viewers.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Mamdani&rsquo;s victory in the New York City mayoral election gave me the opportunity to draw a few maps, and also to learn a bit about incorporating additional spatial data into maps drawn in R. R is not a specialized piece of GIS software. ESRI&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/">ArcGIS</a> being the 800lb gorilla in this world and <a href="https://qgis.org">QGIS</a> being the <a href="https://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a> to its Photoshop, so to speak.</p>
        <p>Still, you can do a lot of spatial stuff in R, grounded in the <a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/"><code>sf</code> package</a> and its many friends. Plus you get the benefit of all the data manipulation and analysis stuff that R is really good at. So, having gotten the precinct-level results for the election, some maps from New York City (e.g., the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/content/planning/pages/resources/datasets/borough-boundaries">clipped borough boundaries map</a>), and <a href="https://www.mta.info/developers">GTFS data from the MTA</a> describing the structure of the subway system, I was able to draw some things. I strongly approve of the existence of the <a href="https://gtfs.org">GTFS</a>, by the way. It&rsquo;s a spec for encoding transit data and lots of cities use it. Really handy.</p>
        <p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a map. For each precinct with more than twenty voters, I combined the Sliwa/Cuomo vote into what we might call (purely for compactness reasons) the Slimo vote, calculated the Mamdani and Slimo vote shares as a proportion, and subtracted the former from the latter. That gets us a score raning from -1 to +1. I then cut that into bins, ten on each side of the zero line, to get deciles in each direction. That&rsquo;s what we fill the precincts with. For the map I also drew the subway stations and lines. Several lines that are right next to each other are in effect drawn on top of one another in several places, e.g. the A and the C, or the 1 and the 3, etc, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter for this map. (You may have heard that drawing transit maps meant for navigation is a really hard information design challenge.) We then use a discrete, diverging scale. Here&rsquo;s the result.</p>

                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I chose a blue-green color gradient partly to experiment with it and partly because neither the election nor this particular cut of the data is quite the usual Blue vs Red, Democrat vs Republican. For one thing we have amalgamated two candidates on one side of the spectrum. For another, Cuomo is in some sense a Democrat, so the way voters were split is trickier than it normally would be. <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/11/06/if-cuomo-had-been-able-to-run-against-mamdani-head-to-head/">Andrew Gelman has some more thoughts on this today</a>.</p>
        <p>You can see a bunch of nice neighborhood patterns, such as e.g. the Hasidic communities in Brooklyn who voted strongly for Cuomo. And you can also see evidence of the <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2015/06/12/americas-ur-choropleths/">characteristic weakness of choropleths</a>, which is the way they can force a number characterizing some number of persons to be represented by a shape representing some area of space.</p>
        <p>One solution to this is to make a dot-density map. You put a dot on the map for every person (or maybe every n people) you want to represent. Here&rsquo;s what that looks like, with a 1-to-1 representation of dots to voters.</p>
        <figure class="full-width"><a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/11/06/mamdani-vs-sliwa/cuomo/subway-mamdani-slimo-dotmap300.png" data-fancybox>

                    <p>Dot dot dot.</p>
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This is better than a choropleth in some key ways. For one thing, you can see that&mdash;even in New York City&mdash;some places are both much more densely populated than others and also more likely to turn out to vote. To be clear, when I say &ldquo;each dot represents one vote&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not as if I know the identity of any particular voter, or how they voted, or that we can precisely locate them to their home address. I promise I don&rsquo;t know that. Only the NSA and the Phone Company know that stuff. What I do know is how many votes were cast for each candidate within each of the 4,200 or so precincts. And I have a polygon that represents the shape of each precinct. So I spatially sample without replacement within each polygon to randomly place a dot for each voter within their precinct. With two million or so votes the pointillist effect ends up being quite effective.</p>
        <figure><a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/11/06/mamdani-vs-sliwa/cuomo/subway-mamdani-slimo-detail3.png" data-fancybox>

                    <p>Detail of the PDF.</p>
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There are costs, of course. Color choice is harder, especially with more than one category of dot at once. The image tends to look less bright because you&rsquo;re not using a big swatch of paint across a large area. In addition, when you draw a few million dots at any kind of resolution then your file size gets big real fast. The image above is a 300dpi 4,500x4,500 pixel PNG and it&rsquo;s 10mb in size before being crushed down further (with <code>optipng</code>) to 8.6mb or so. I could make a JPG of course, which would be a lot smaller, but then you start running into the question of why you made a dot-density map in the first place, because you lose detail in the raster. Meanwhile, thanks to the wonders of multiplication, a 600dpi version of the same image is much sharper to zoom in on but is also about 34mb in size. Meanwhile a PDF, as a vector format, is even bigger, weighing in at 60MB. Rendering a PDF with that many vector elements does not make Preview or Illustrator happy, let me tell you. The benefit of course is that you can scale it up to any size you like without loss, as shown above. Because browsers are crazy and so is javascript, it&rsquo;s possible to serve up dot density maps like this in real time in a way that makes them zoomable and fluid, but that&rsquo;s not my department.</p>]]>

Still, you can do a lot of spatial stuff in R, grounded in the [`sf` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and its many friends. Plus you get the benefit of all the data manipulation and analysis stuff that R is really good at. So, having gotten the precinct-level results for the election, some maps from New York City (e.g., the [clipped borough boundaries map](https://www.nyc.gov/content/planning/pages/resources/datasets/borough-boundaries)), and [GTFS data from the MTA](https://www.mta.info/developers) describing the structure of the subway system, I was able to draw some things. I strongly approve of the existence of the [GTFS](https://gtfs.org), by the way. It’s a spec for encoding transit data and lots of cities use it. Really handy.

Anyway, here’s a map. For each precinct with more than twenty voters, I combined the Sliwa/Cuomo vote into what we might call (purely for compactness reasons) the Slimo vote, calculated the Mamdani and Slimo vote shares as a proportion, and subtracted the former from the latter. That gets us a score raning from -1 to +1. I then cut that into bins, ten on each side of the zero line, to get deciles in each direction. That’s what we fill the precincts with. For the map I also drew the subway stations and lines. Several lines that are right next to each other are in effect drawn on top of one another in several places, e.g. the A and the C, or the 1 and the 3, etc, but that doesn’t matter for this map. (You may have heard that drawing transit maps meant for navigation is a really hard information design challenge.) We then use a discrete, diverging scale. Here’s the result.

Oh, choropleths

I chose a blue-green color gradient partly to experiment with it and partly because neither the election nor this particular cut of the data is quite the usual Blue vs Red, Democrat vs Republican. For one thing we have amalgamated two candidates on one side of the spectrum. For another, Cuomo is in some sense a Democrat, so the way voters were split is trickier than it normally would be. [Andrew Gelman has some more thoughts on this today](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/11/06/if-cuomo-had-been-able-to-run-against-mamdani-head-to-head/).

You can see a bunch of nice neighborhood patterns, such as e.g. the Hasidic communities in Brooklyn who voted strongly for Cuomo. And you can also see evidence of the [characteristic weakness of choropleths](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2015/06/12/americas-ur-choropleths/), which is the way they can force a number characterizing some number of persons to be represented by a shape representing some area of space.

One solution to this is to make a dot-density map. You put a dot on the map for every person (or maybe every n people) you want to represent. Here’s what that looks like, with a 1-to-1 representation of dots to voters.

[![Precinct-level vote shares for Mamdani vs Sliwa/Cuomo, dot-density version](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/11/06/mamdani-vs-sliwa/cuomo/subway-mamdani-slimo-dotmap300.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/11/06/mamdani-vs-sliwa/cuomo/subway-mamdani-slimo-dotmap300.png)

Dot dot dot.

This is better than a choropleth in some key ways. For one thing, you can see that—even in New York City—some places are both much more densely populated than others and also more likely to turn out to vote. To be clear, when I say “each dot represents one vote”, it’s not as if I know the identity of any particular voter, or how they voted, or that we can precisely locate them to their home address. I promise I don’t know that. Only the NSA and the Phone Company know that stuff. What I do know is how many votes were cast for each candidate within each of the 4,200 or so precincts. And I have a polygon that represents the shape of each precinct. So I spatially sample without replacement within each polygon to randomly place a dot for each voter within their precinct. With two million or so votes the pointillist effect ends up being quite effective.

[![Precinct-level vote shares for Mamdani vs Sliwa/Cuomo, dot-density version, high-res detail](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/11/06/mamdani-vs-sliwa/cuomo/subway-mamdani-slimo-detail3.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/11/06/mamdani-vs-sliwa/cuomo/subway-mamdani-slimo-detail3.png)

Detail of the PDF.

There are costs, of course. Color choice is harder, especially with more than one category of dot at once. The image tends to look less bright because you’re not using a big swatch of paint across a large area. In addition, when you draw a few million dots at any kind of resolution then your file size gets big real fast. The image above is a 300dpi 4,500x4,500 pixel PNG and it’s 10mb in size before being crushed down further (with `optipng`) to 8.6mb or so. I could make a JPG of course, which would be a lot smaller, but then you start running into the question of why you made a dot-density map in the first place, because you lose detail in the raster. Meanwhile, thanks to the wonders of multiplication, a 600dpi version of the same image is much sharper to zoom in on but is also about 34mb in size. Meanwhile a PDF, as a vector format, is even bigger, weighing in at 60MB. Rendering a PDF with that many vector elements does not make Preview or Illustrator happy, let me tell you. The benefit of course is that you can scale it up to any size you like without loss, as shown above. Because browsers are crazy and so is javascript, it’s possible to serve up dot density maps like this in real time in a way that makes them zoomable and fluid, but that’s not my department.</source:markdown>

        <p>There was a time when JavaScript libraries really did abstract away browser differences that you probably didn’t want to deal with yourself.

        <p>These days, client-side JavaScript frameworks don’t abstract away the underlying platform, they instead try to be an alternative.

        <p>When you use a JavaScript framework, that isn’t the end of your work, it’s just the beginning. You still have to write your own code that makes use of that framework. Except now your code is restricted to only what the framework can do.</p>

      <source:markdown>If you’re building software, it’s generally a good idea to avoid the [Not-Invented-Here syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here).

And yet most developers still believe that using a JavaScript framework somehow enables them to do _more_.

[Jim Nielsen has a great framing on this](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/browser-apis-as-sass/). JavaScript libraries aren’t like payment providers or email services.

If you agree that using a `button` makes more sense than using a `div`, then I encourage you to apply the same thinking to everything else your app needs to do.

Take advantage of all the wonderful things you can do in web browsers today. If instead you decide to use a JavaScript framework, you’re basically inventing from scratch.

        <h4 id="code-research">Code research</h4>
        <p>Software development benefits enormously from something I call <strong>code research</strong>. The great thing about questions about code is that they can often be definitively answered by writing and executing code.</p>
        <p>I often see questions on forums which hint at a lack of understanding of this skill.</p>
        <p>"Could Redis work for powering the notifications feed for my app?" is a great example. The answer is <em>always</em> "it depends", but a better answer is that a good programmer already has everything they need to answer that question for themselves. Build a proof-of-concept, simulate the patterns you expect to see in production, then run experiments to see if it's going to work.</p>
        <p>I've been a keen practitioner of code research for a long time. Many of my most interesting projects started out as a few dozen lines of experimental code to prove to myself that something was possible.</p>
        <h4 id="coding-agents">Coding agents</h4>
        <p>It turns out <strong>coding agents</strong> like Claude Code and Codex are a fantastic fit for this kind of work as well. Give them the right goal and a useful environment and they'll churn through a basic research project without any further supervision.</p>
        <p>LLMs hallucinate and make mistakes. This is far less important for code research tasks because the code itself doesn't lie: if they write code and execute it and it does the right things then they've demonstrated to both themselves and to you that something really does work.</p>
        <p>They can't prove something is impossible - just because the coding agent couldn't find a way to do something doesn't mean it can't be done - but they can often demonstrate that something <em>is</em> possible in just a few minutes of crunching.</p>
        <h4 id="asynchronous-coding-agents">Asynchronous coding agents</h4>
        <p>I've used interactive coding agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI for a bunch of these, but today I'm increasingly turning to their <strong>asynchronous coding agent</strong> family members instead.</p>
        <p>An asynchronous coding agent is a coding agent that operates on a fire-and-forget basis. You pose it a task, it churns away on a server somewhere and when it's done it files a pull request against your chosen GitHub repository.</p>
        <p>OpenAI's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/codex">Codex Cloud</a>, Anthropic's <a href="https://claude.ai/code">Claude Code for web</a>, Google Gemini's <a href="https://jules.google/">Jules</a>, and GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Copilot coding agent</a> are four prominent examples of this pattern.</p>
        <p>These are <em>fantastic</em> tools for code research projects. Come up with a clear goal, turn it into a few paragraphs of prompt, set them loose and check back ten minutes later to see what they've come up with.</p>
        <p>I'm firing off 2-3 code research projects a day right now. My own time commitment is minimal and they frequently come back with useful or interesting results.</p>
        <h4 id="give-them-a-dedicated-github-repository">Give them a dedicated GitHub repository</h4>
        <p>You can run a code research task against an existing GitHub repository, but I find it's much more liberating to have a separate, dedicated repository for your coding agents to run their projects in.</p>
        <p>This frees you from being limited to research against just code you've already written, and also means you can be much less cautious about what you let the agents do.</p>
        <p>I have two repositories that I use for this - one public, one private. I use the public one for research tasks that have no need to be private, and the private one for anything that I'm not yet ready to share with the world.</p>
        <h4 id="let-them-rip-with-unlimited-network-access">Let them rip with unlimited network access</h4>
        <p>The biggest benefit of a dedicated repository is that you don't need to be cautious about what the agents operating in that repository can do.</p>
        <p>Both Codex Cloud and Claude Code for web default to running agents in a locked-down environment, with strict restrictions on how they can access the network. This makes total sense if they are running against sensitive repositories - a prompt injection attack of the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">lethal trifecta</a> variety could easily be used to steal sensitive code or environment variables.</p>
        <p>If you're running in a fresh, non-sensitive repository you don't need to worry about this at all! I've configured my research repositories for full network access, which means my coding agents can install any dependencies they need, fetch data from the web and generally do anything I'd be able to do on my own computer.</p>
        <h4 id="my-simonw-research-collection">My simonw/research collection</h4>
        <p>Let's dive into some examples. My public research repository is at <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research">simonw/research</a> on GitHub. It currently contains 13 folders, each of which is a separate research project. I only created it two weeks ago so I'm already averaging nearly one a day!</p>
        <p>It also includes <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-readme.yml">a GitHub Workflow</a> which uses <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-models">GitHub Models</a> to automatically update <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/README.md">the README</a> file with a summary of every new project, using <a href="https://cog.readthedocs.io/">Cog</a>, <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models">llm-github-models</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/b059108dfefeb05a48e1c27f7a127dc9fd648129/README.md#L9-L116">this snippet of Python</a>.</p>
        <p>Here are a some example research projects from the repo.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/node-pyodide">node-pyodide</a></strong> shows an example of a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/node-pyodide/server-simple.js">Node.js script</a> that runs the <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> WebAssembly distribution of Python inside it - yet another of my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/sandboxing+python/">ongoing attempts</a> to find a great way of running Python in a WebAssembly sandbox on a server.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/python-markdown-comparison">python-markdown-comparison</a></strong> (<a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?fb07c2a3fd2d4cfb814a46696a58a00e">transcript</a>) provides a detailed performance benchmark of seven different Python Markdown libraries. I fired this one off because I stumbled across <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cmarkgfm/">cmarkgfm</a>, a Python binding around GitHub's Markdown implementation in C, and wanted to see how it compared to the other options. This one produced some charts! <code>cmarkgfm</code> came out on top by a significant margin:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/markdown-performance.png" alt="Bar chart titled &quot;Relative Performance vs cmarkgfm (Large Document)&quot; comparing relative speed of markdown libraries, with marko at 52.1x, markdown2 at 16.9x, mistletoe at 14.1x, markdown at 12.9x, commonmark at 12.1x, mistune at 10.0x, and cmarkgfm at 1.0x baseline marked by a red dashed line; x-axis labeled &quot;Relative Speed (lower is better)&quot; ranging from 0 to 50+" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>Here's the entire prompt I used for that project:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Create a performance benchmark and feature comparison report on PyPI cmarkgfm compared to other popular Python markdown libraries - check all of them out from github and read the source to get an idea for features, then design and run a benchmark including generating some charts, then create a report in a new python-markdown-comparison folder (do not create a _summary.md file or edit anywhere outside of that folder). Make sure the performance chart images are directly displayed in the README.md in the folder.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Note that I didn't specify any Markdown libraries other than <code>cmarkgfm</code> - Claude Code ran a search and found the other six by itself.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/cmarkgfm-in-pyodide">cmarkgfm-in-pyodide</a></strong> is a lot more fun. A neat thing about having all of my research projects in the same repository is that new projects can build on previous ones. Here I decided to see how hard it would be to get <code>cmarkgfm</code> - which has a C extension - working inside Pyodide inside Node.js. Claude successfully compiled a 88.4KB <code>cmarkgfm_pyodide-2025.10.22-cp312-cp312-emscripten_3_1_46_wasm32.whl</code> file with the necessary C extension and proved it could be loaded into Pyodide in WebAssembly inside of Node.js.</p>
        <p>I ran this one using Claude Code on my laptop after an initial attempt failed. The starting prompt was:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Figure out how to get the cmarkgfm markdown lover <em>[typo in prompt, this should have been "library" but it figured it out anyway]</em> for Python working in pyodide. This will be hard because it uses C so you will need to compile it to pyodide compatible webassembly somehow. Write a report on your results plus code to a new cmarkgfm-in-pyodide directory. Test it using pytest to exercise a node.js test script that calls pyodide as seen in the existing node.js and pyodide directory</p>
        <p>There is an existing branch that was an initial attempt at this research, but which failed because it did not have Internet access. You do have Internet access. Use that existing branch to accelerate your work, but do not commit any code unless you are certain that you have successfully executed tests that prove that the pyodide module you created works correctly.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This one gave up half way through, complaining that emscripten would take too long. I told it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Complete this project, actually run emscripten, I do not care how long it takes, update the report if it works</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It churned away for a bit longer and complained that the existing Python library used CFFI which isn't available in Pyodide. I asked it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Can you figure out how to rewrite cmarkgfm to not use FFI and to use a pyodide-friendly way of integrating that C code instead?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>... and it did. You can <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?6d778a8f9c4c2c005a189ff308c3bc47">see the full transcript here</a>.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/blog-tags-scikit-learn">blog-tags-scikit-learn</a></strong>. Taking a short break from WebAssembly, I thought it would be fun to put <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> through its paces on a text classification task against my blog:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Work in a new folder called blog-tags-scikit-learn</p>
        <p>Download <code>https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog.db</code> - a SQLite database. Take a look at the blog_entry table and the associated tags - a lot of the earlier entries do not have tags associated with them, where the later entries do. Design, implement and execute models to suggests tags for those earlier entries based on textual analysis against later ones</p>
        <p>Use Python scikit learn and try several different strategies</p>
        <p>Produce JSON of the results for each one, plus scripts for running them and a detailed markdown description</p>
        <p>Also include an HTML page with a nice visualization of the results that works by loading those JSON files.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This resulted in seven <code>.py</code> files, four <code>.json</code> results files and a detailed <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/blog-tags-scikit-learn/README.md">report</a>. (It ignored the bit about an HTML page with a nice visualization for some reason.) Not bad for a few moments of idle curiosity typed into my phone!</p>
        <p>That's just three of the thirteen projects in the repository so far. The commit history for each one usually links to the prompt and sometimes the transcript if you want to see how they unfolded.</p>
        <p>More recently I added a short <code>AGENTS.md</code> file to the repo with a few extra tips for my research agents. You can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/b059108dfefeb05a48e1c27f7a127dc9fd648129/AGENTS.md">read that here</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="this-is-total-slop-of-course">This is total slop, of course</h4>
        <p>My preferred definition of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/8/slop/">AI slop</a> is AI-generated content that is published without human review. I've not been reviewing these reports in great detail myself, and I wouldn't usually publish them online without some serious editing and verification.</p>
        <p>I want to share the pattern I'm using though, so I decided to keep them quarantined in this one public <code>simonw/research</code> repository.</p>
        <p>A tiny feature request for GitHub: I'd love to be able to mark a repository as "exclude from search indexes" such that it gets labelled with <code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex"&gt;</code> tags. I still like to keep AI-generated content out of search, to avoid contributing more to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">dead internet</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="try-it-yourself">Try it yourself</h4>
        <p>It's pretty easy to get started trying out this coding agent research pattern. Create a free GitHub repository (public or private) and let some agents loose on it and see what happens.</p>
        <p>You can run agents locally but I find the asynchronous agents to be more convenient - especially as I can run them (or trigger them from my phone) without any fear of them damaging my own machine or leaking any of my private data.</p>
        <p>Claude Code for web offers <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12690958-claude-code-promotion">a free $250 of credits</a> for their $20/month users for a limited time (until November 18, 2025). Gemini Jules has <a href="https://jules.google/docs/usage-limits/">a free tier</a>. There are plenty of other coding agents you can try out as well.</p>
        <p>Let me know if your research agents come back with anything interesting!</p>

      <source:markdown>I&#39;ve been experimenting with a pattern for LLM usage recently that&#39;s working out really well: **asynchronous code research tasks**. Pick a research question, spin up an asynchronous coding agent and let it go and run some experiments and report back when it&#39;s done.

#### Code research

Software development benefits enormously from something I call **code research**. The great thing about questions about code is that they can often be definitively answered by writing and executing code.

I often see questions on forums which hint at a lack of understanding of this skill.

&#34;Could Redis work for powering the notifications feed for my app?&#34; is a great example. The answer is _always_ &#34;it depends&#34;, but a better answer is that a good programmer already has everything they need to answer that question for themselves. Build a proof-of-concept, simulate the patterns you expect to see in production, then run experiments to see if it&#39;s going to work.

I&#39;ve been a keen practitioner of code research for a long time. Many of my most interesting projects started out as a few dozen lines of experimental code to prove to myself that something was possible.

#### Coding agents

It turns out **coding agents** like Claude Code and Codex are a fantastic fit for this kind of work as well. Give them the right goal and a useful environment and they&#39;ll churn through a basic research project without any further supervision.

LLMs hallucinate and make mistakes. This is far less important for code research tasks because the code itself doesn&#39;t lie: if they write code and execute it and it does the right things then they&#39;ve demonstrated to both themselves and to you that something really does work.

They can&#39;t prove something is impossible - just because the coding agent couldn&#39;t find a way to do something doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be done - but they can often demonstrate that something _is_ possible in just a few minutes of crunching.

#### Asynchronous coding agents

I&#39;ve used interactive coding agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI for a bunch of these, but today I&#39;m increasingly turning to their **asynchronous coding agent** family members instead.

An asynchronous coding agent is a coding agent that operates on a fire-and-forget basis. You pose it a task, it churns away on a server somewhere and when it&#39;s done it files a pull request against your chosen GitHub repository.

OpenAI&#39;s [Codex Cloud](https://chatgpt.com/codex), Anthropic&#39;s [Claude Code for web](https://claude.ai/code), Google Gemini&#39;s [Jules](https://jules.google/), and GitHub&#39;s [Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent?utm_source=chatgpt.com) are four prominent examples of this pattern.

These are _fantastic_ tools for code research projects. Come up with a clear goal, turn it into a few paragraphs of prompt, set them loose and check back ten minutes later to see what they&#39;ve come up with.

I&#39;m firing off 2-3 code research projects a day right now. My own time commitment is minimal and they frequently come back with useful or interesting results.

#### Give them a dedicated GitHub repository

You can run a code research task against an existing GitHub repository, but I find it&#39;s much more liberating to have a separate, dedicated repository for your coding agents to run their projects in.

This frees you from being limited to research against just code you&#39;ve already written, and also means you can be much less cautious about what you let the agents do.

I have two repositories that I use for this - one public, one private. I use the public one for research tasks that have no need to be private, and the private one for anything that I&#39;m not yet ready to share with the world.

#### Let them rip with unlimited network access

The biggest benefit of a dedicated repository is that you don&#39;t need to be cautious about what the agents operating in that repository can do.

Both Codex Cloud and Claude Code for web default to running agents in a locked-down environment, with strict restrictions on how they can access the network. This makes total sense if they are running against sensitive repositories - a prompt injection attack of the [lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) variety could easily be used to steal sensitive code or environment variables.

If you&#39;re running in a fresh, non-sensitive repository you don&#39;t need to worry about this at all! I&#39;ve configured my research repositories for full network access, which means my coding agents can install any dependencies they need, fetch data from the web and generally do anything I&#39;d be able to do on my own computer.

#### My simonw/research collection

Let&#39;s dive into some examples. My public research repository is at [simonw/research](https://github.com/simonw/research) on GitHub. It currently contains 13 folders, each of which is a separate research project. I only created it two weeks ago so I&#39;m already averaging nearly one a day!

It also includes [a GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-readme.yml) which uses [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models) to automatically update [the README](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/README.md) file with a summary of every new project, using [Cog](https://cog.readthedocs.io/), [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/), [llm-github-models](https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models) and [this snippet of Python](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/b059108dfefeb05a48e1c27f7a127dc9fd648129/README.md#L9-L116).

Here are a some example research projects from the repo.

**[node-pyodide](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/node-pyodide)** shows an example of a [Node.js script](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/node-pyodide/server-simple.js) that runs the [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) WebAssembly distribution of Python inside it - yet another of my [ongoing attempts](https://simonwillison.net/tags/sandboxing+python/) to find a great way of running Python in a WebAssembly sandbox on a server.

**[python-markdown-comparison](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/python-markdown-comparison)** ( [transcript](https://gistpreview.github.io/?fb07c2a3fd2d4cfb814a46696a58a00e)) provides a detailed performance benchmark of seven different Python Markdown libraries. I fired this one off because I stumbled across [cmarkgfm](https://pypi.org/project/cmarkgfm/), a Python binding around GitHub&#39;s Markdown implementation in C, and wanted to see how it compared to the other options. This one produced some charts! `cmarkgfm` came out on top by a significant margin:

![Bar chart titled &#34;Relative Performance vs cmarkgfm (Large Document)&#34; comparing relative speed of markdown libraries, with marko at 52.1x, markdown2 at 16.9x, mistletoe at 14.1x, markdown at 12.9x, commonmark at 12.1x, mistune at 10.0x, and cmarkgfm at 1.0x baseline marked by a red dashed line; x-axis labeled &#34;Relative Speed (lower is better)&#34; ranging from 0 to 50+](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/markdown-performance.png)

Here&#39;s the entire prompt I used for that project:

&#62; Create a performance benchmark and feature comparison report on PyPI cmarkgfm compared to other popular Python markdown libraries - check all of them out from github and read the source to get an idea for features, then design and run a benchmark including generating some charts, then create a report in a new python-markdown-comparison folder (do not create a \_summary.md file or edit anywhere outside of that folder). Make sure the performance chart images are directly displayed in the README.md in the folder.

Note that I didn&#39;t specify any Markdown libraries other than `cmarkgfm` \- Claude Code ran a search and found the other six by itself.

**[cmarkgfm-in-pyodide](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/cmarkgfm-in-pyodide)** is a lot more fun. A neat thing about having all of my research projects in the same repository is that new projects can build on previous ones. Here I decided to see how hard it would be to get `cmarkgfm` \- which has a C extension - working inside Pyodide inside Node.js. Claude successfully compiled a 88.4KB `cmarkgfm_pyodide-2025.10.22-cp312-cp312-emscripten_3_1_46_wasm32.whl` file with the necessary C extension and proved it could be loaded into Pyodide in WebAssembly inside of Node.js.

I ran this one using Claude Code on my laptop after an initial attempt failed. The starting prompt was:

&#62; Figure out how to get the cmarkgfm markdown lover _\[typo in prompt, this should have been &#34;library&#34; but it figured it out anyway\]_ for Python working in pyodide. This will be hard because it uses C so you will need to compile it to pyodide compatible webassembly somehow. Write a report on your results plus code to a new cmarkgfm-in-pyodide directory. Test it using pytest to exercise a node.js test script that calls pyodide as seen in the existing node.js and pyodide directory
&#62;
&#62; There is an existing branch that was an initial attempt at this research, but which failed because it did not have Internet access. You do have Internet access. Use that existing branch to accelerate your work, but do not commit any code unless you are certain that you have successfully executed tests that prove that the pyodide module you created works correctly.

This one gave up half way through, complaining that emscripten would take too long. I told it:

&#62; Complete this project, actually run emscripten, I do not care how long it takes, update the report if it works

It churned away for a bit longer and complained that the existing Python library used CFFI which isn&#39;t available in Pyodide. I asked it:

&#62; Can you figure out how to rewrite cmarkgfm to not use FFI and to use a pyodide-friendly way of integrating that C code instead?

... and it did. You can [see the full transcript here](https://gistpreview.github.io/?6d778a8f9c4c2c005a189ff308c3bc47).

**[blog-tags-scikit-learn](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/blog-tags-scikit-learn)**. Taking a short break from WebAssembly, I thought it would be fun to put [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) through its paces on a text classification task against my blog:

&#62; Work in a new folder called blog-tags-scikit-learn
&#62;
&#62; Download `https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog.db` \- a SQLite database. Take a look at the blog\_entry table and the associated tags - a lot of the earlier entries do not have tags associated with them, where the later entries do. Design, implement and execute models to suggests tags for those earlier entries based on textual analysis against later ones
&#62;
&#62; Use Python scikit learn and try several different strategies
&#62;
&#62; Produce JSON of the results for each one, plus scripts for running them and a detailed markdown description
&#62;
&#62; Also include an HTML page with a nice visualization of the results that works by loading those JSON files.

This resulted in seven `.py` files, four `.json` results files and a detailed [report](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/blog-tags-scikit-learn/README.md). (It ignored the bit about an HTML page with a nice visualization for some reason.) Not bad for a few moments of idle curiosity typed into my phone!

That&#39;s just three of the thirteen projects in the repository so far. The commit history for each one usually links to the prompt and sometimes the transcript if you want to see how they unfolded.

More recently I added a short `AGENTS.md` file to the repo with a few extra tips for my research agents. You can [read that here](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/b059108dfefeb05a48e1c27f7a127dc9fd648129/AGENTS.md).

#### This is total slop, of course

My preferred definition of [AI slop](https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/8/slop/) is AI-generated content that is published without human review. I&#39;ve not been reviewing these reports in great detail myself, and I wouldn&#39;t usually publish them online without some serious editing and verification.

I want to share the pattern I&#39;m using though, so I decided to keep them quarantined in this one public `simonw/research` repository.

A tiny feature request for GitHub: I&#39;d love to be able to mark a repository as &#34;exclude from search indexes&#34; such that it gets labelled with `&#60;meta name=&#34;robots&#34; content=&#34;noindex&#34;&#62;` tags. I still like to keep AI-generated content out of search, to avoid contributing more to the [dead internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory).

#### Try it yourself

It&#39;s pretty easy to get started trying out this coding agent research pattern. Create a free GitHub repository (public or private) and let some agents loose on it and see what happens.

You can run agents locally but I find the asynchronous agents to be more convenient - especially as I can run them (or trigger them from my phone) without any fear of them damaging my own machine or leaking any of my private data.

Claude Code for web offers [a free $250 of credits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12690958-claude-code-promotion) for their $20/month users for a limited time (until November 18, 2025). Gemini Jules has [a free tier](https://jules.google/docs/usage-limits/). There are plenty of other coding agents you can try out as well.

Let me know if your research agents come back with anything interesting!

      <source:markdown># 2025-10-02 GitHub from the command-line

I tried both `git-hub` and `gh` and failed twice. Years ago, I tried some git-forge integration with magit in Emacs, too. It didn’t work.

In comparison, just `git` works.

Somebody sends me the URL to their repository in an email with an explanation.
I add a “remote” using their name, and fetch the info I need.

```
cd ~/src/cool
git remote add berta https://example.org/berta/cool
git fetch berta
git checkout berta/some-feature
git log
...
git checkout main
git merge berta/some-feature

```

Something like that. And then I write a nice email back.

This is not the dreaded email flow. This is working with remotes. All this requires is that all the contributors have public git repositories. These can be on GitHub (😓), GitLab, sourcehut (😄), Codeberg (😍), self-hosted, whatever.

The only thing that doesn’t work is communicating via the web interface about issues and pull requests or merge requests. Use email or instant messengers. Works for me. My projects are not popular.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-w832-gg5g-x44m">Open redirect endpoint in Datasette prior to 0.65.2 and 1.0a21</a></strong></p>
        This GitHub security advisory covers two new releases of Datasette that I shipped today, both addressing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2429">the same open redirect issue</a> with a fix by <a href="https://github.com/jamesjefferies">James Jefferies</a>.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-65-2">Datasette 0.65.2</a></strong> fixes the bug and also adds Python 3.14 support and a <code>datasette publish cloudrun</code> fix.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a21-2025-11-05">Datasette 1.0a21</a></strong> also has that Cloud Run fix and two other small new features:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>New <code>datasette --get /path --headers</code> option for inspecting the headers returned by a path. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2578">#2578</a>)</li>
        <li>New <code>datasette.client.get(..., skip_permission_checks=True)</code> parameter to bypass permission checks when making requests using the internal client. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2583">#2583</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I decided to include the Cloud Run deployment fix so anyone with Datasette instances deployed to Cloud Run can update them with the new patched versions.

      <source:markdown>**[Open redirect endpoint in Datasette prior to 0.65.2 and 1.0a21](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-w832-gg5g-x44m)**

This GitHub security advisory covers two new releases of Datasette that I shipped today, both addressing [the same open redirect issue](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2429) with a fix by [James Jefferies](https://github.com/jamesjefferies).

**[Datasette 0.65.2](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-65-2)** fixes the bug and also adds Python 3.14 support and a `datasette publish cloudrun` fix.

**[Datasette 1.0a21](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a21-2025-11-05)** also has that Cloud Run fix and two other small new features:

&#62; - New `datasette --get /path --headers` option for inspecting the headers returned by a path. ( [#2578](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2578))
&#62; - New `datasette.client.get(..., skip_permission_checks=True)` parameter to bypass permission checks when making requests using the internal client. ( [#2583](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2583))

I decided to include the Cloud Run deployment fix so anyone with Datasette instances deployed to Cloud Run can update them with the new patched versions.

      <source:markdown>On the NetNewsWire blog I’ve just announced NetNewsWire 6.2 for Mac and iOS.

This release is almost entirely bug fixes — but it does add a couple small features and one potentially interesting one: it now supports Markdown in RSS (via the `source:markdown` element). [Read all about it](https://netnewswire.blog/2025/11/05/netnewswire-for-mac-and-ios.html) on the NetNewsWire blog.

(And now we’re working on NetNewsWire 7, which [will adopt the new Liquid Glass UI](https://netnewswire.blog/2025/10/07/the-liquid-glass-plan.html).)</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[<p>NetNewsWire 6.2 is on the App Store for iOS, and you can download the Mac version (or do NetNewsWire &gt; Check for Updates… if you’re already running the app).</p>
        
        <p>Long-time Mac users will understand when we say that this is a Snow Leopard release — it fixes a bunch of bugs, makes some things faster, and adds only a couple features.</p>
        
        <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/releases/tag/mac-6.2">release notes for Mac</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/releases/tag/iOS-6.2-6202">release notes for iOS</a> for more details. (They’re largely the same.)</p>
        
        <p>Note also that it doesn’t adopt Liquid Glass. We’ll be doing that in NetNewsWire 7, which we’re working on now. (See <a href="https://netnewswire.blog/2025/10/07/the-liquid-glass-plan.html">The Liquid Glass Plan</a>.)</p>
        
        <p>All that said — there is one new feature of potential interest: we’ve added support for Markdown in RSS feeds. When the parser encounters a <code>source:markdown</code> element, we save it in the database, and the app renders the Markdown as HTML and displays it in the article view.</p>
        
        <p>There aren’t many feeds that include Markdown yet, but we hope that changes! You can read more about it in Dave Winer’s <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInRss">Dev notes for Markdown in RSS</a>.</p>
        
        <p>While we’re not sure where this feature will take us, we have some thoughts. One is that RSS and Markdown were always destined to meet in this way, and it’s about time. :) Another is that this is a part of making posting/editing/replying over the web — as opposed to closed social networks — easier. This is part of making the web itself the social network.</p>
        
        <p>Anyway. It’s a foundation! We keep going.</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>**[Code execution with MCP: Building more efficient agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp)**

When I [wrote about Claude Skills](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/) I mentioned that I don&#39;t use MCP at all any more when working with coding agents - I find CLI utilities and libraries like Playwright Python to be a more effective way of achieving the same goals.

This new piece from Anthropic proposes a way to bring the two worlds more closely together.

It identifies two challenges with MCP as it exists today. The first has been widely discussed before: all of those tool descriptions take up a lot of valuable real estate in the agent context even before you start using them.

The second is more subtle but equally interesting: chaining multiple MCP tools together involves passing their responses through the context, absorbing more valuable tokens and introducing chances for the LLM to make additional mistakes.

What if you could turn MCP tools into code functions instead, and then let the LLM wire them together with executable code?

Anthropic&#39;s example here imagines a system that turns MCP tools into TypeScript files on disk, looking something like this:

```
// ./servers/google-drive/getDocument.ts
interface GetDocumentInput {
  documentId: string;
}
interface GetDocumentResponse {
  content: string;
}
/* Read a document from Google Drive */
export async function getDocument(input: GetDocumentInput): Promise&#60;GetDocumentResponse&#62; {
  return callMCPTool&#60;GetDocumentResponse&#62;(&#39;google_drive__get_document&#39;, input);
}
```

This takes up no tokens at all - it&#39;s a file on disk. In a similar manner to Skills the agent can navigate the filesystem to discover these definitions on demand.

Then it can wire them together by generating code:

```
const transcript = (await gdrive.getDocument({ documentId: &#39;abc123&#39; })).content;
await salesforce.updateRecord({
  objectType: &#39;SalesMeeting&#39;,
  recordId: &#39;00Q5f000001abcXYZ&#39;,
  data: { Notes: transcript }
});
```

Notably, the example here avoids round-tripping the response from the `gdrive.getDocument()` call through the model on the way to the `salesforce.updateRecord()` call - which is faster, more reliable, saves on context tokens, and avoids the model being exposed to any potentially sensitive data in that document.

This all looks very solid to me! I think it&#39;s a sensible way to take advantage of the strengths of coding agents and address some of the major drawbacks of MCP as it is usually implemented today.

There&#39;s one catch: Anthropic outline the proposal in some detail but provide no code to execute on it! Implementation is left as an exercise for the reader:

&#62; If you implement this approach, we encourage you to share your findings with the [MCP community](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication).

Six years ago, I replaced the old HVAC system that came with our house, a central forced air system installed in 1995[1](#fn:oldinstall).

The new system is a Trane XR AC paired with an [S9V2 96% efficiency forced-air gas furnace](https://www.trane.com/residential/en/products/furnaces/premier-96/). And it ran great! Better efficiency, quieter, multiple fan speeds so I can circulate air and prevent stale air in some parts of the house... what&#39;s not to love?

Well, apparently the engineering:

        <p>Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html">permissions system</a> exists to answer the following question:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Is this <strong>actor</strong> allowed to perform this <strong>action</strong>, optionally against this particular <strong>resource</strong>?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>An <strong>actor</strong> is usually a user, but might also be an automation operating via the Datasette API.</p>
        <p>An <strong>action</strong> is a thing they need to do - things like view-table, execute-sql, insert-row.</p>
        <p>A <strong>resource</strong> is the subject of the action - the database you are executing SQL against, the table you want to insert a row into.</p>
        <p>Datasette's default configuration is public but read-only: anyone can view databases and tables or execute read-only SQL queries but no-one can modify data.</p>
        <p>Datasette plugins can enable all sorts of additional ways to interact with databases, many of which need to be protected by a form of authentication Datasette also 1.0 includes <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/2/datasette-write-api/">a write API</a> with a need to configure who can insert, update, and delete rows or create new tables.</p>
        <p>Actors can be authenticated in a number of different ways provided by plugins using the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#actor-from-request-datasette-request">actor_from_request()</a> plugin hook. <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords">datasette-auth-passwords</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-github">datasette-auth-github</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-existing-cookies">datasette-auth-existing-cookies</a> are examples of authentication plugins.</p>
        <h4 id="permissions-systems-need-to-be-able-to-efficiently-list-things">Permissions systems need to be able to efficiently list things</h4>
        <p>The previous implementation included a design flaw common to permissions systems of this nature: each permission check involved a function call which would delegate to one or more plugins and return a True/False result.</p>
        <p>This works well for single checks, but has a significant problem: what if you need to show the user a list of things they can access, for example the tables they can view?</p>
        <p>I want Datasette to be able to handle potentially thousands of tables - tables in SQLite are cheap! I don't want to have to run 1,000+ permission checks just to show the user a list of tables.</p>
        <p>Since Datasette is built on top of SQLite we already have a powerful mechanism to help solve this problem. SQLite is <em>really</em> good at filtering large numbers of records.</p>
        <h4 id="the-new-permission-resources-sql-plugin-hook">The new permission_resources_sql() plugin hook</h4>
        <p>The biggest change in the new release is that I've replaced the previous  <code>permission_allowed(actor, action, resource)</code> plugin hook - which let a plugin determine if an actor could perform an action against a resource - with a new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-permission-resources-sql">permission_resources_sql(actor, action)</a> plugin hook.</p>
        <p>Instead of returning a True/False result, this new hook returns a SQL query that returns rules helping determine the resources the current actor can execute the specified action against.</p>
        <p>Here's an example, lifted from the documentation:</p>
        <pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">datasette</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">hookimpl</span>

        <span class="pl-en">@<span class="pl-s1">hookimpl</span></span>
        <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">permission_resources_sql</span>(<span class="pl-s1">datasette</span>, <span class="pl-s1">actor</span>, <span class="pl-s1">action</span>):

                <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-c1">None</span>
            <span class="pl-k">if</span> <span class="pl-c1">not</span> <span class="pl-s1">actor</span> <span class="pl-c1">or</span> <span class="pl-s1">actor</span>.<span class="pl-c1">get</span>(<span class="pl-s">"id"</span>) <span class="pl-c1">!=</span> <span class="pl-s">"alice"</span>:

            <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-en">PermissionSQL</span>(
                <span class="pl-s1">sql</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"""</span>
        <span class="pl-s">            SELECT</span>
        <span class="pl-s">                'accounting' AS parent,</span>
        <span class="pl-s">                'sales' AS child,</span>
        <span class="pl-s">                1 AS allow,</span>
        <span class="pl-s">                'alice can view accounting/sales' AS reason</span>
        <span class="pl-s">        """</span>,
            )</pre>
        <p>This hook grants the actor with ID "alice" permission to view the "sales" table in the "accounting" database.</p>
        <p>The <code>PermissionSQL</code> object should always return four columns: a parent, child, allow (1 or 0), and a reason string for debugging.</p>
        <p>When you ask Datasette to list the resources an actor can access for a specific action, it will combine the SQL returned by all installed plugins into a single query that joins against <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#internal-database-schema">the internal catalog tables</a> and efficiently lists all the resources the actor can access.</p>
        <p>This query can then be limited or paginated to avoid loading too many results at once.</p>
        <h4 id="hierarchies-plugins-vetoes-and-restrictions">Hierarchies, plugins, vetoes, and restrictions</h4>
        <p>Datasette has several additional requirements that make the permissions system more complicated.</p>
        <p>Datasette permissions can optionally act against a two-level <strong>hierarchy</strong>. You can grant a user the ability to insert-row against a specific table, or every table in a specific database, or every table in <em>every</em> database in that Datasette instance.</p>
        <p>Some actions can apply at the table level, others the database level and others only make sense globally - enabling a new feature that isn't tied to tables or databases, for example.</p>
        <p>Datasette currently has <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html#built-in-actions">ten default actions</a> but <strong>plugins</strong> that add additional features can <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#register-actions-datasette">register new actions</a> to better participate in the permission systems.</p>
        <p>Datasette's permission system has a mechanism to <strong>veto</strong> permission checks - a plugin can return a deny for a specific permission check which will override any allows. This needs to be hierarchy-aware - a deny at the database level can be outvoted by an allow at the table level.</p>
        <p>Finally, Datasette includes a mechanism for applying additional <strong>restrictions</strong> to a request. This was introduced for Datasette's API - it allows a user to create an API token that can act on their behalf but is only allowed to perform a subset of their capabilities - just reading from two specific tables, for example. Restrictions are <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html#restricting-the-actions-that-a-token-can-perform">described in more detail</a> in the documentation.</p>
        <p>That's a lot of different moving parts for the new implementation to cover.</p>
        <h4 id="new-debugging-tools">New debugging tools</h4>
        <p>Since permissions are critical to the security of a Datasette deployment it's vital that they are as easy to understand and debug as possible.</p>
        <p>The new alpha adds several new debugging tools, including this page that shows the full list of resources matching a specific action for the current user:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/datasette-allowed-resources.jpg" alt="Allowed resources. Tabs are Playground, Check, Allowed, Rules, Actions, Allow debug. There is a form where you can select an action (here view-table) and optionally filter by parent and child. Below is a table of results listing resource paths - e.g. /fixtures/name-of-table - plus parent, child and reason columns. The reason is a JSON list for example &quot;datasette.default_permissions: root user&quot;,&quot;datasette.default_permissions: default allow for view-table&quot;." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>And this page listing the <em>rules</em> that apply to that question - since different plugins may return different rules which get combined together:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/datasette-rules.jpg" alt="The rules tab for the same view-table question. Here there are two allow rules - one from datasette.default_permissions for the root user and another from default_permissions labelled default allow for view-table." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>This screenshot illustrates two of Datasette's built-in rules: there is a default allow for read-only operations such as view-table (which can be over-ridden by plugins) and another rule that says the root user can do anything (provided Datasette was started with the <code>--root</code> option.)</p>
        <p>Those rules are defined in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/1.0a20/datasette/default_permissions.py">datasette/default_permissions.py</a> Python module.</p>
        <h4 id="the-missing-feature-list-actors-who-can-act-on-this-resource">The missing feature: list actors who can act on this resource</h4>
        <p>There's one question that the new system cannot answer: provide a full list of actors who can perform this action against this resource.</p>
        <p>It's not possibly to provide this globally for Datasette because Datasette doesn't have a way to track what "actors" exist in the system. SSO plugins such as <code>datasette-auth-github</code> mean a new authenticated GitHub user might show up at any time, with the ability to perform actions despite the Datasette system never having encountered that particular username before.</p>
        <p>API tokens and actor restrictions come into play here as well. A user might create a signed API token that can perform a subset of actions on their behalf - the existence of that token can't be predicted by the permissions system.</p>
        <p>This is a notable omission, but it's also quite common in other systems. AWS cannot provide a list of all actors who have permission to access a specific S3 bucket, for example - presumably for similar reasons.</p>
        <h4 id="upgrading-plugins-for-datasette-1-0a20">Upgrading plugins for Datasette 1.0a20</h4>
        <p>Datasette's plugin ecosystem is the reason I'm paying so much attention to ensuring Datasette 1.0 has a stable API. I don't want plugin authors to need to chase breaking changes once that 1.0 release is out.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/upgrade_guide.html">Datasette upgrade guide</a> includes detailed notes on upgrades that are needed between the 0.x and 1.0 alpha releases. I've added an extensive section about the permissions changes to that document.</p>
        <p>I've also been experimenting with dumping those instructions directly into coding agent tools - Claude Code and Codex CLI - to have them upgrade existing plugins for me. This has been working <em>extremely well</em>. I've even had Claude Code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/fa978ec1006297416e2cd87a2f0d3cac99283cf8">update those notes itself</a> with things it learned during an upgrade process!</p>
        <p>This is greatly helped by the fact that every single Datasette plugin has an automated test suite that demonstrates the core functionality works as expected. Coding agents can use those tests to verify that their changes have had the desired effect.</p>
        <p>I've also been leaning heavily on <code>uv</code> to help with the upgrade process. I wrote myself two new helper scripts - <code>tadd</code> and <code>radd</code> - to help test the new plugins.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <code>tadd</code> = "test against datasette dev" - it runs a plugin's existing test suite against the current development version of Datasette checked out on my machine. It passes extra options through to <code>pytest</code> so I can run <code>tadd -k test_name</code> or <code>tadd -x --pdb</code> as needed.</li>
        <li>
        <code>radd</code> = "run against datasette dev" - it runs the latest dev <code>datasette</code> command with the plugin installed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <code>tadd</code> and <code>radd</code> implementations <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/python/uv-tests#variants-tadd-and-radd">can be found in this TIL</a>.</p>
        <p>Some of my plugin upgrades have become a one-liner to the <code>codex exec</code> command, which runs OpenAI Codex CLI with a prompt without entering interactive mode:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>codex <span class="pl-c1">exec</span> --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
        <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Run the command tadd and look at the errors and then</span>
        <span class="pl-s">read ~/dev/datasette/docs/upgrade-1.0a20.md and apply</span>
        <span class="pl-s">fixes and run the tests again and get them to pass<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre></div>
        <p>There are still a bunch more to go - there's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2577">a list in this tracking issue</a> - but I expect to have the plugins I maintain all upgraded pretty quickly now that I have a solid process in place.</p>
        <h4 id="using-claude-code-to-implement-this-change">Using Claude Code to implement this change</h4>
        <p>This change to Datasette core <em>by far</em> the most ambitious piece of work I've ever attempted using a coding agent.</p>
        <p>Last year I agreed with the prevailing opinion that LLM assistance was much more useful for greenfield coding tasks than working on existing codebases. The amount you could usefully get done was greatly limited by the need to fit the entire codebase into the model's context window.</p>
        <p>Coding agents have entirely changed that calculation. Claude Code and Codex CLI still have relatively limited token windows - albeit larger than last year - but their ability to search through the codebase, read extra files on demand and "reason" about the code they are working with has made them vastly more capable.</p>
        <p>I no longer see codebase size as a limiting factor for how useful they can be.</p>
        <p>I've also spent enough time with Claude Sonnet 4.5 to build a weird level of trust in it. I can usually predict exactly what changes it will make for a prompt. If I tell it "extract this code into a separate function" or "update every instance of this pattern" I know it's likely to get it right.</p>
        <p>For something like permission code I still review everything it does, often by watching it as it works since it displays diffs in the UI.</p>
        <p>I also pay extremely close attention to the tests it's writing. Datasette 1.0a19 already had 1,439 tests, many of which exercised the existing permission system. 1.0a20 increases that to 1,583 tests. I feel very good about that, especially since most of the existing tests continued to pass without modification.</p>
        <h4 id="starting-with-a-proof-of-concept">Starting with a proof-of-concept</h4>
        <p>I built several different proof-of-concept implementations of SQL permissions before settling on the final design. My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-permissions-poc">research/sqlite-permissions-poc</a> project was the one that finally convinced me of a viable approach,</p>
        <p>That one started as a <a href="https://claude.ai/share/8fd432bc-a718-4883-9978-80ab82a75c87">free ranging conversation with Claude</a>, at the end of which I told it to generate a specification which I then <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68f6532f-9920-8006-928a-364e15b6e9ef">fed into GPT-5</a> to implement. You can see that specification <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-permissions-poc#original-prompt">at the end of the README</a>.</p>
        <p>I later fed the POC itself into Claude Code and had it implement the first version of the new Datasette system based on that previous experiment.</p>
        <p>This is admittedly a very weird way of working, but it helped me finally break through on a problem that I'd been struggling with for months.</p>
        <h4 id="miscellaneous-tips-i-picked-up-along-the-way">Miscellaneous tips I picked up along the way</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>When working on anything relating to plugins it's vital to have at least a few real plugins that you upgrade in lock-step with the core changes. The <code>tadd</code> and <code>radd</code> shortcuts were invaluable for productively working on those plugins while I made changes to core.</li>
        <li>Coding agents make experiments <em>much</em> cheaper. I threw away so much code on the way to the final implementation, which was psychologically easier because the cost to create that code in the first place was so low.</li>
        <li>Tests, tests, tests. This project would have been impossible without that existing test suite. The additional tests we built along the way give me confidence that the new system is as robust as I need it to be.</li>
        <li>Claude writes good commit messages now! I finally gave in and let it write these - previously I've been determined to write them myself. It's a big time saver to be able to say "write a tasteful commit message for these changes".</li>
        <li>Claude is also great at breaking up changes into smaller commits. It can also productively rewrite history to make it easier to follow, especially useful if you're still working in a branch.</li>
        <li>A really great way to review Claude's changes is with the GitHub PR interface. You can attach comments to individual lines of code and then later prompt Claude like this: <code>Use gh CLI to fetch comments on URL-to-PR and make the requested changes</code>. This is a very quick way to apply little nitpick changes - rename this function, refactor this repeated code, add types here etc.</li>
        <li>The code I write with LLMs is <em>higher quality code</em>. I usually find myself making constant trade-offs while coding: this function would be neater if I extracted this helper, it would be nice to have inline documentation here, this changing this would be good but would break a dozen tests... for each of those I have to determine if the additional time is worth the benefit. Claude can apply changes so much faster than me that these calculations have changed - almost any improvement is worth applying, no matter how trivial, because the time cost is so low.</li>
        <li>Internal tools are cheap now. The new debugging interfaces were mostly written by Claude and are significantly nicer to use and look at than the hacky versions I would have knocked out myself, if I had even taken the extra time to build them.</li>
        <li>That trick with a Markdown file full of upgrade instructions works astonishingly well - it's the same basic idea as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">Claude Skills</a>. I maintain over 100 Datasette plugins now and I expect I'll be automating all sorts of minor upgrades in the future using this technique.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="what-s-next-">What's next?</h4>
        <p>Now that the new alpha is out my focus is upgrading the existing plugin ecosystem to use it, and supporting other plugin authors who are doing the same.</p>
        <p>The new permissions system unlocks some key improvements to Datasette Cloud concerning finely-grained permissions for larger teams, so I'll be integrating the new alpha there this week.</p>
        <p>This is the single biggest backwards-incompatible change required before Datasette 1.0. I plan to apply the lessons I learned from this project to the other, less intimidating changes. I'm hoping this can result in a final 1.0 release before the end of the year!</p>

#### Understanding the permissions system

Datasette&#39;s [permissions system](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html) exists to answer the following question:

&#62; Is this **actor** allowed to perform this **action**, optionally against this particular **resource**?

An **actor** is usually a user, but might also be an automation operating via the Datasette API.

An **action** is a thing they need to do - things like view-table, execute-sql, insert-row.

A **resource** is the subject of the action - the database you are executing SQL against, the table you want to insert a row into.

Datasette&#39;s default configuration is public but read-only: anyone can view databases and tables or execute read-only SQL queries but no-one can modify data.

Datasette plugins can enable all sorts of additional ways to interact with databases, many of which need to be protected by a form of authentication Datasette also 1.0 includes [a write API](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/2/datasette-write-api/) with a need to configure who can insert, update, and delete rows or create new tables.

Actors can be authenticated in a number of different ways provided by plugins using the [actor\_from\_request()](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#actor-from-request-datasette-request) plugin hook. [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords) and [datasette-auth-github](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-github) and [datasette-auth-existing-cookies](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-existing-cookies) are examples of authentication plugins.

#### Permissions systems need to be able to efficiently list things

The previous implementation included a design flaw common to permissions systems of this nature: each permission check involved a function call which would delegate to one or more plugins and return a True/False result.

This works well for single checks, but has a significant problem: what if you need to show the user a list of things they can access, for example the tables they can view?

I want Datasette to be able to handle potentially thousands of tables - tables in SQLite are cheap! I don&#39;t want to have to run 1,000+ permission checks just to show the user a list of tables.

Since Datasette is built on top of SQLite we already have a powerful mechanism to help solve this problem. SQLite is _really_ good at filtering large numbers of records.

#### The new permission\_resources\_sql() plugin hook

The biggest change in the new release is that I&#39;ve replaced the previous `permission_allowed(actor, action, resource)` plugin hook - which let a plugin determine if an actor could perform an action against a resource - with a new [permission\_resources\_sql(actor, action)](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-permission-resources-sql) plugin hook.

Instead of returning a True/False result, this new hook returns a SQL query that returns rules helping determine the resources the current actor can execute the specified action against.

Here&#39;s an example, lifted from the documentation:

```
from datasette import hookimpl
from datasette.permissions import PermissionSQL

@hookimpl
def permission_resources_sql(datasette, actor, action):
    if action != &#34;view-table&#34;:
        return None
    if not actor or actor.get(&#34;id&#34;) != &#34;alice&#34;:
        return None

    return PermissionSQL(
        sql=&#34;&#34;&#34;
            SELECT
                &#39;accounting&#39; AS parent,
                &#39;sales&#39; AS child,
                1 AS allow,
                &#39;alice can view accounting/sales&#39; AS reason
        &#34;&#34;&#34;,
    )
```

This hook grants the actor with ID &#34;alice&#34; permission to view the &#34;sales&#34; table in the &#34;accounting&#34; database.

The `PermissionSQL` object should always return four columns: a parent, child, allow (1 or 0), and a reason string for debugging.

When you ask Datasette to list the resources an actor can access for a specific action, it will combine the SQL returned by all installed plugins into a single query that joins against [the internal catalog tables](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#internal-database-schema) and efficiently lists all the resources the actor can access.

This query can then be limited or paginated to avoid loading too many results at once.

#### Hierarchies, plugins, vetoes, and restrictions

Datasette has several additional requirements that make the permissions system more complicated.

Datasette permissions can optionally act against a two-level **hierarchy**. You can grant a user the ability to insert-row against a specific table, or every table in a specific database, or every table in _every_ database in that Datasette instance.

Some actions can apply at the table level, others the database level and others only make sense globally - enabling a new feature that isn&#39;t tied to tables or databases, for example.

Datasette currently has [ten default actions](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html#built-in-actions) but **plugins** that add additional features can [register new actions](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#register-actions-datasette) to better participate in the permission systems.

Datasette&#39;s permission system has a mechanism to **veto** permission checks - a plugin can return a deny for a specific permission check which will override any allows. This needs to be hierarchy-aware - a deny at the database level can be outvoted by an allow at the table level.

Finally, Datasette includes a mechanism for applying additional **restrictions** to a request. This was introduced for Datasette&#39;s API - it allows a user to create an API token that can act on their behalf but is only allowed to perform a subset of their capabilities - just reading from two specific tables, for example. Restrictions are [described in more detail](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html#restricting-the-actions-that-a-token-can-perform) in the documentation.

That&#39;s a lot of different moving parts for the new implementation to cover.

#### New debugging tools

Since permissions are critical to the security of a Datasette deployment it&#39;s vital that they are as easy to understand and debug as possible.

The new alpha adds several new debugging tools, including this page that shows the full list of resources matching a specific action for the current user:

![Allowed resources. Tabs are Playground, Check, Allowed, Rules, Actions, Allow debug. There is a form where you can select an action (here view-table) and optionally filter by parent and child. Below is a table of results listing resource paths - e.g. /fixtures/name-of-table - plus parent, child and reason columns. The reason is a JSON list for example &#34;datasette.default_permissions: root user&#34;,&#34;datasette.default_permissions: default allow for view-table&#34;.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/datasette-allowed-resources.jpg)

And this page listing the _rules_ that apply to that question - since different plugins may return different rules which get combined together:

![The rules tab for the same view-table question. Here there are two allow rules - one from datasette.default_permissions for the root user and another from default_permissions labelled default allow for view-table.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/datasette-rules.jpg)

This screenshot illustrates two of Datasette&#39;s built-in rules: there is a default allow for read-only operations such as view-table (which can be over-ridden by plugins) and another rule that says the root user can do anything (provided Datasette was started with the `--root` option.)

Those rules are defined in the [datasette/default\_permissions.py](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/1.0a20/datasette/default_permissions.py) Python module.

#### The missing feature: list actors who can act on this resource

There&#39;s one question that the new system cannot answer: provide a full list of actors who can perform this action against this resource.

It&#39;s not possibly to provide this globally for Datasette because Datasette doesn&#39;t have a way to track what &#34;actors&#34; exist in the system. SSO plugins such as `datasette-auth-github` mean a new authenticated GitHub user might show up at any time, with the ability to perform actions despite the Datasette system never having encountered that particular username before.

API tokens and actor restrictions come into play here as well. A user might create a signed API token that can perform a subset of actions on their behalf - the existence of that token can&#39;t be predicted by the permissions system.

This is a notable omission, but it&#39;s also quite common in other systems. AWS cannot provide a list of all actors who have permission to access a specific S3 bucket, for example - presumably for similar reasons.

#### Upgrading plugins for Datasette 1.0a20

Datasette&#39;s plugin ecosystem is the reason I&#39;m paying so much attention to ensuring Datasette 1.0 has a stable API. I don&#39;t want plugin authors to need to chase breaking changes once that 1.0 release is out.

The [Datasette upgrade guide](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/upgrade_guide.html) includes detailed notes on upgrades that are needed between the 0.x and 1.0 alpha releases. I&#39;ve added an extensive section about the permissions changes to that document.

I&#39;ve also been experimenting with dumping those instructions directly into coding agent tools - Claude Code and Codex CLI - to have them upgrade existing plugins for me. This has been working _extremely well_. I&#39;ve even had Claude Code [update those notes itself](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/fa978ec1006297416e2cd87a2f0d3cac99283cf8) with things it learned during an upgrade process!

This is greatly helped by the fact that every single Datasette plugin has an automated test suite that demonstrates the core functionality works as expected. Coding agents can use those tests to verify that their changes have had the desired effect.

I&#39;ve also been leaning heavily on `uv` to help with the upgrade process. I wrote myself two new helper scripts - `tadd` and `radd` \- to help test the new plugins.

- `tadd` = &#34;test against datasette dev&#34; - it runs a plugin&#39;s existing test suite against the current development version of Datasette checked out on my machine. It passes extra options through to `pytest` so I can run `tadd -k test_name` or `tadd -x --pdb` as needed.
- `radd` = &#34;run against datasette dev&#34; - it runs the latest dev `datasette` command with the plugin installed.

The `tadd` and `radd` implementations [can be found in this TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/uv-tests#variants-tadd-and-radd).

Some of my plugin upgrades have become a one-liner to the `codex exec` command, which runs OpenAI Codex CLI with a prompt without entering interactive mode:

```
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
&#34;Run the command tadd and look at the errors and then
read ~/dev/datasette/docs/upgrade-1.0a20.md and apply
fixes and run the tests again and get them to pass&#34;
```

There are still a bunch more to go - there&#39;s [a list in this tracking issue](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2577) \- but I expect to have the plugins I maintain all upgraded pretty quickly now that I have a solid process in place.

#### Using Claude Code to implement this change

This change to Datasette core _by far_ the most ambitious piece of work I&#39;ve ever attempted using a coding agent.

Last year I agreed with the prevailing opinion that LLM assistance was much more useful for greenfield coding tasks than working on existing codebases. The amount you could usefully get done was greatly limited by the need to fit the entire codebase into the model&#39;s context window.

Coding agents have entirely changed that calculation. Claude Code and Codex CLI still have relatively limited token windows - albeit larger than last year - but their ability to search through the codebase, read extra files on demand and &#34;reason&#34; about the code they are working with has made them vastly more capable.

I no longer see codebase size as a limiting factor for how useful they can be.

I&#39;ve also spent enough time with Claude Sonnet 4.5 to build a weird level of trust in it. I can usually predict exactly what changes it will make for a prompt. If I tell it &#34;extract this code into a separate function&#34; or &#34;update every instance of this pattern&#34; I know it&#39;s likely to get it right.

For something like permission code I still review everything it does, often by watching it as it works since it displays diffs in the UI.

I also pay extremely close attention to the tests it&#39;s writing. Datasette 1.0a19 already had 1,439 tests, many of which exercised the existing permission system. 1.0a20 increases that to 1,583 tests. I feel very good about that, especially since most of the existing tests continued to pass without modification.

#### Starting with a proof-of-concept

I built several different proof-of-concept implementations of SQL permissions before settling on the final design. My [research/sqlite-permissions-poc](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-permissions-poc) project was the one that finally convinced me of a viable approach,

That one started as a [free ranging conversation with Claude](https://claude.ai/share/8fd432bc-a718-4883-9978-80ab82a75c87), at the end of which I told it to generate a specification which I then [fed into GPT-5](https://chatgpt.com/share/68f6532f-9920-8006-928a-364e15b6e9ef) to implement. You can see that specification [at the end of the README](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/sqlite-permissions-poc#original-prompt).

I later fed the POC itself into Claude Code and had it implement the first version of the new Datasette system based on that previous experiment.

This is admittedly a very weird way of working, but it helped me finally break through on a problem that I&#39;d been struggling with for months.

#### Miscellaneous tips I picked up along the way

- When working on anything relating to plugins it&#39;s vital to have at least a few real plugins that you upgrade in lock-step with the core changes. The `tadd` and `radd` shortcuts were invaluable for productively working on those plugins while I made changes to core.
- Coding agents make experiments _much_ cheaper. I threw away so much code on the way to the final implementation, which was psychologically easier because the cost to create that code in the first place was so low.
- Tests, tests, tests. This project would have been impossible without that existing test suite. The additional tests we built along the way give me confidence that the new system is as robust as I need it to be.
- Claude writes good commit messages now! I finally gave in and let it write these - previously I&#39;ve been determined to write them myself. It&#39;s a big time saver to be able to say &#34;write a tasteful commit message for these changes&#34;.
- Claude is also great at breaking up changes into smaller commits. It can also productively rewrite history to make it easier to follow, especially useful if you&#39;re still working in a branch.
- A really great way to review Claude&#39;s changes is with the GitHub PR interface. You can attach comments to individual lines of code and then later prompt Claude like this: `Use gh CLI to fetch comments on URL-to-PR and make the requested changes`. This is a very quick way to apply little nitpick changes - rename this function, refactor this repeated code, add types here etc.
- The code I write with LLMs is _higher quality code_. I usually find myself making constant trade-offs while coding: this function would be neater if I extracted this helper, it would be nice to have inline documentation here, this changing this would be good but would break a dozen tests... for each of those I have to determine if the additional time is worth the benefit. Claude can apply changes so much faster than me that these calculations have changed - almost any improvement is worth applying, no matter how trivial, because the time cost is so low.
- Internal tools are cheap now. The new debugging interfaces were mostly written by Claude and are significantly nicer to use and look at than the hacky versions I would have knocked out myself, if I had even taken the extra time to build them.
- That trick with a Markdown file full of upgrade instructions works astonishingly well - it&#39;s the same basic idea as [Claude Skills](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/). I maintain over 100 Datasette plugins now and I expect I&#39;ll be automating all sorts of minor upgrades in the future using this technique.

#### What&#39;s next?

Now that the new alpha is out my focus is upgrading the existing plugin ecosystem to use it, and supporting other plugin authors who are doing the same.

The new permissions system unlocks some key improvements to Datasette Cloud concerning finely-grained permissions for larger teams, so I&#39;ll be integrating the new alpha there this week.

This is the single biggest backwards-incompatible change required before Datasette 1.0. I plan to apply the lessons I learned from this project to the other, less intimidating changes. I&#39;m hoping this can result in a final 1.0 release before the end of the year!

Tim Kellogg proposes a neat way to think about prompt injection, especially with respect to MCP tools.

Classify every tool with a color: red if it exposes the agent to untrusted (potentially malicious) instructions, blue if it involves a &#34;critical action&#34; - something you would not want an attacker to be able to trigger.

This means you can configure your agent to actively avoid mixing the two colors at once:

&#62; The Chore: Go label every data input, and **every tool** (especially MCP tools). For MCP tools &#38; resources, you can use the \_meta object to keep track of the color. The agent can decide at runtime (or earlier) if it’s gotten into an unsafe state.
&#62;
&#62; Personally, I like to automate. I needed to label ~200 tools, so I put them in a spreadsheet and used an LLM to label them. That way, I could focus on being **precise and clear** about my criteria for what constitutes “red”, “blue” or “neither”. That way I ended up with an artifact that scales beyond my initial set of tools.

      <source:markdown># `Group by All`: Generate `group by` from `select`

![Full BigQuery support since at least 2020-03-28. Full Oracle DB support since 23.9.](https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/group-by-all/group-by-all.tl.png)

1. Removes the `group by all` clause if it leads to an error that does not happen without `group by` clause

Some Systems allow the special `group by all` syntax as a shorthand for grouping on all `select` items that do not have an aggregate function.

```
SELECT customers.id, customers.name, count(orders.id)
  FROM customers
  LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
 GROUP BY ALL
```

This is equivalent to listing `customers.id` and `customers.name` in the `group by` clause explicitly.

The two short-hands provided by the standard (detection of functional dependencies and `any_value`) require a little more typing but provide a safety-net against accidental changes of the grouping key: If the example above is extended to also select the `orders.placed` column, it silently changes the grouping key—even if that was not intended.

* * *

#### Probably in PostgreSQL 19

[This feature was committed for PostgreSQL 19](https://www.depesz.com/2025/10/02/waiting-for-postgresql-19-add-group-by-all/).

- [The `ANY_VALUE(…)` Aggregate Function: New in SQL:2023 — and a better feature from 1999](https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/any_value)


## Normative References

The `group by all` syntax as shown above is not covered in ISO/IEC 9075-2:2023. The keyword `all` must not be mistaken for the `&#60;set quantifier&#62;`, which is also allowed in `group by` (T434, “GROUP BY DISTINCT”).

* * *

#### Probably in the Next Standard

[This feature is probably in the next standard](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/6db86e0b-697a-4e4b-860a-7ad9736a8e81%40postgresfriends.org). However, as the standard doesn’t allow for expressions in the `group by` clause, `group by all` is non-conforming if items added to `group by` are not just column names.

As most systems do support expressions in `group by`, there is still a standardization gap that might lead to different results in different systems in a few corner cases, for example here: `select a + COUNT(*) OVER()`.[✓✗](https://modern-sql.com/caniuse/group-by-all#tl)

#### zubin - 2025-11-04

The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
second release candidate of GHC 9.14.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at [downloads.haskell.org](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-rc2).

The changes from the first release candidate are:

- Bump the exceptions submodule to 0.10.11
- Bump the os-string submodule to 2.0.8
- Fix a driver regression causing an infinite loop with cyclic imports

GHC 9.14 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:

- Significant improvements in specialisation:

  - The `SPECIALISE` pragma now allows use of type application syntax
  - The `SPECIALISE` pragma can be used to specialise for expression arguments
    as well as type arguments.
  - Specialisation is now considerably more reliable in the presence of
    `newtype` s
- Significant GHCi improvements including:

  - Correctness and performance improvements in the bytecode interpreter
  - Features in the GHCi debugger
  - Support for multiple home units in GHCi
- Implementation of the [Explicit Level Imports proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0682-explicit-level-imports.rst)

- `RequiredTypeArguments` can now be used in more contexts

- SSE/AVX2 support in the x86 native code generator backend

- A major update of the Windows toolchain and improved compatibility with
  macOS Tahoe

- … and many more


A full accounting of changes can be found in the [release notes](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-rc2/docs/users_guide/9.14.1-notes.html). Given the
many specialisation improvements and their potential for regression, we would
very much appreciate testing and performance characterisation on downstream
workloads.

Note that while this release makes many improvements in the specialisation
optimisation, polymorphic specialisation will remain disabled by default in the
final release due to concern over regressions of the sort identified in
[#26329](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26329). Users needing more aggressive specialisation can explicitly
enable this feature with the `-fpolymorphic-specialisation` flag. Depending
upon our experience with 9.14.1, we may enable this feature by default in a
later minor release.

contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind support has facilitated GHC
maintenance and release management over the years. Finally, this release would
not have been possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose
work have made the Haskell ecosystem what it is today.

      <source:markdown>**[The fetch()ening](https://htmx.org/essays/the-fetchening/)**

After several years of stable htmx 2.0 and a promise to never release a backwards-incompatible htmx 3 Carson Gross is technically keeping that promise... by skipping to htmx 4 instead!

The main reason is to replace `XMLHttpRequest` with `fetch()` \- a change that will have enough knock-on compatibility effects to require a major version bump - so they&#39;re using that as an excuse to clean up various other accumulated design warts at the same time.

htmx is a _very_ responsibly run project. Here&#39;s their plan for the upgrade:

&#62; That said, htmx 2.0 users _will_ face an upgrade project when moving to 4.0 in a way that they did not have to in moving from 1.0 to 2.0.
&#62;
&#62; I am sorry about that, and want to offer three things to address it:
&#62;
&#62; - htmx 2.0 (like htmx 1.0 &#38; intercooler.js 1.0) will be supported _in perpetuity_, so there is absolutely _no_ pressure to upgrade your application: if htmx 2.0 is satisfying your hypermedia needs, you can stick with it.
&#62; - We will create extensions that revert htmx 4 to htmx 2 behaviors as much as is feasible (e.g. Supporting the old implicit attribute inheritance model, at least)
&#62; - We will roll htmx 4.0 out slowly, over a multi-year period. As with the htmx 1.0 -&#62; 2.0 upgrade, there will be a long period where htmx 2.x is `latest` and htmx 4.x is `next`

There are lots of neat details in here about the design changes they plan to make. It&#39;s a really great piece of technical writing - I learned a bunch about htmx and picked up some good notes on API design in general from this.

      <title>The case against pgvector</title>

        I wasn't keen on the title of this piece but the content is great: Alex Jacobs talks through lessons learned trying to run the popular pgvector PostgreSQL vector indexing extension at scale, in particular the challenges involved in maintaining a large index with close-to-realtime updates using the IVFFlat or HNSW index types.</p>
        <p>The section on pre-v.s.-post filtering is particularly useful:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Okay but let's say you solve your index and insert problems. Now you have a document search system with millions of vectors. Documents have metadata---maybe they're marked as <code>draft</code>, <code>published</code>, or <code>archived</code>. A user searches for something, and you only want to return published documents.</p>
        <p>[...] should Postgres filter on status first (pre-filter) or do the vector search first and then filter (post-filter)?</p>
        <p>This seems like an implementation detail. It’s not. It’s the difference between queries that take 50ms and queries that take 5 seconds. It’s also the difference between returning the most relevant results and… not.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45798479">Hacker News thread</a> for this article attracted a robust discussion, including some fascinating comments by Discourse developer Rafael dos Santos Silva (xfalcox) about how they are using pgvector at scale:</p>

Series Overview

This is the first in a series of posts on the true cost of a programming language.

## The Leadership Blindspot: How Identity Drives Multi-Million Dollar Technical Debt

A programming language is the single most expensive choice a company makes, yet we treat it like a technical debate. After watching this mistake bankrupt dozens of companies and hurt hundreds more, I’ve learned the uncomfortable truth: these decisions are rarely about technology. They’re about identity, emotion, and ego, and they’re destroying your velocity and budget in ways you can’t see until it’s too late.</source:markdown>

It's an amazing technology for its power and simplicity. Basically it allows a server running in the cloud to send information to an app running in the browser, or for that matter an iOS app running on an phone. Then the question is what do you want to use the socket for? And the answer is that to make syndication <i>even simpler and faster than RSS</i>. If you want to know more, there's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket">client toolkit</a> and <a href="https://socketdemo.feedland.org/?url=wss://feedland.com:443/_ws/">demo app</a> on GitHub, open source of course. How real is it? The <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on scripting.com is a sockets app, a much-improved blogroll from the ones we had 20 years ago. Also runs on WordPress sites.

      <source:markdown>England is criss-crossed by routes that were originally laid down by the Romans. When it came time to construct modern roads, it often made sense to use these existing routes rather than trying to designate entirely new ones. So [some of the roads in England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_roads_in_Britannia#List_of_Roman_Roads_and_modern_numberings) are like an early kind of desire path.

[Desire paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) are something of a cliché in the UX world. They’re the perfect metaphor for user-centred design; instead of trying to make people take a pre-defined route, let them take the route that’s easiest for them and then codify that route.

&#62; When a practice is already widespread among authors, consider adopting it rather than forbidding it or inventing something new.

Ireland never had any Roman roads. But it’s always had plenty of cowpaths.

The Irish word for cow is _bó_.

The Irish word for road is [_bóthar_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/b%C3%B3thar), which literally means “cowpath”.

        <![CDATA[<p><i>I'm part of the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman</a> community email list. There's a tradition that people are introduce themselves at this time, so I thought I should also, since this is my first year on the list. This is a copy of the email I sent. </i></p>
        <p>My name is Dave Winer. I was at Berkman in 2003-04.</p>
        <p>I've been so impressed with the stories you all have been telling, and I felt I should get into the mix, but my story will be different because I am not an academic, though I love the academic environment, find it very energizing. </p>
        <p>So, my story --</p>
        <p>I started a bunch of things before coming to Berkman. Undergrad degree in math, masters in Computer Science, ran two software companies, was by some measure the first blogger, played a role in the bootstrap of RSS, and at Berkman we launched podcasting via the two BloggerCons we had there. </p>
        <p>I loved the reunion we had two summers ago, and think we should build on that. </p>
        <p>I got a very strong feeling from revisiting the campus that we should have kept going with the blogging we started at Berkman in 2003, and if we had done so, I think we'd be in a better position in social media today. We had a jump on Twitter, Facebook (which was also starting on campus at the same time). And we were doing everything with open protocols, all parts replaceable. Very different from the way the commercial networks are built. </p>
        <p>What I'm working on these days is primarily <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, where feeds and words get together using nothing but the open web, with all parts replaceable. </p>
        <p>We use WordPress, via its REST API, as the platform for writing, we add a beautiful and simple new writer's toolkit, all in one place with all the administrative stuff out of the way. </p>
        <p>This product will also introduce an API that makes it easy for developers to create new editors because there are a lot of types of editors and people have their favorites. </p>
        <p>I'm working closely with the people of WordPress, gave a demo at WordCamp Canada a couple of weeks ago. I loved it, a lot of the energy of BloggerCon. I wish I had joined them years earlier. Their community has been growing for 20+ years. In tech that's a long time. </p>
        <p>It's also been about 20 years since we finished work on RSS 2.0, and that's the other major thing WordLand is built around. It's how messages fly around the net. Again totally replaceable parts. </p>
        <p>Berkman helped us with RSS 2.0, the official spec is <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">hosted</a> at <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/">cyber.harvard.edu</a>, and hopefully will remain there as an artifact, a basis for interop, for perpetuity. Many thanks for the help here, it needed a permanent place to stay frozen, the tech industry very much wanted to take it apart. It's still going strong even though tech leaders and journalists have proclaimed it dead many many times. Wishful <a href="https://isrssdead.com/">thinking</a>, things like RSS don't die. :-)</p>
        <p>I am committed to getting around the silos of the owners of social media, and making it possible for developers and users to build their own networks with their own rules, and not have to wait for corporate programmers to give them the tools, we need to be able to make them for ourselves. This btw to me has always been the ethos of Berkman, coming from Barlow and Nesson, it's the old idea that the web should set us free, not create new more entertaining <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html">hamster cages</a> for us to play in to delight our masters. </p>
        <p>These days I wonder how we can help Harvard do the things it's so good at that few people understand. People, esp young college-age people, should know there are ways to contribute beyond attaining <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html">unusable wealth</a>. I think what they want is a way to compete, to be great, to challenge themselves, and to win, and the money is secondary, a way to measure success. We can and should be creating new ways to measure the greatness of individual young people, directed towards more satisfying ends than making more money than they could possibly ever use. (And of course understanding that not all young people grow up to want to prove their worth, but the ones who vie to be the baddest billionaire have caused a lot of problems, and could use some alternate theories of how to be great. When I was young, I definitely was one of the ones with something to prove.)</p>
        <p>Anyway back to Harvard. It took forever for Harvard to admit publicity that podcasting incubated there. It did eventually come but only in passing, in an introduction at a 2008 conference, where I took a <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2494080913/">picture</a> of the moment. Thanks to my friend John Palfrey for making this happen. </p>
        <p>I believe that universities like Harvard should be constantly hosting the kind of work we were doing then, like a teaching hospital. It's not enough imho to study technology and leave the development of it to the industry. Then you get software designed by bankers. I want a continuing stream of innovation to come out of academia, with people returning to teach what they learned to students who came to get skills that will help them do good and make a good living, and then a few years later they come back, again and again. It should be a self-renewing process. </p>
        <p>I wrote about this several times over the last decade or so, I call this idea <a href="https://this.how/phoenix/">Developing Better Developers</a>. </p>
        <p>I think the next best thing for now would be to have a homecoming for Berkman every two summers perhaps, where we get a chance to develop a pulse. And see where that goes. It's obviously a lot of work. The one we had brought back a lot of good ideas and friendships that we should still be working on together. </p>
        <p>I live in the Catskills btw, as you can tell from the subject line, just west of Kingston. Before that I spent nine years in Manhattan, before that Berkeley, Seattle, places like that. And Cambridge of course!  :-)</p>
        <p>Dave</p>
        <p>PS: At the reunion I remember telling David Weinberger that I had hung up my <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/hang+up+your+spurs">spurs</a>, I was done developing. It turned out I wasn't done. Heh. I think people like me never hang em up voluntarily. Who knows. ;-)</p>

      <source:markdown>_I&#39;m part of the [Berkman](https://cyber.harvard.edu/) community email list. There&#39;s a tradition that people are introduce themselves at this time, so I thought I should also, since this is my first year on the list. This is a copy of the email I sent._

My name is Dave Winer. I was at Berkman in 2003-04.

I&#39;ve been so impressed with the stories you all have been telling, and I felt I should get into the mix, but my story will be different because I am not an academic, though I love the academic environment, find it very energizing.

So, my story --

I started a bunch of things before coming to Berkman. Undergrad degree in math, masters in Computer Science, ran two software companies, was by some measure the first blogger, played a role in the bootstrap of RSS, and at Berkman we launched podcasting via the two BloggerCons we had there.

I loved the reunion we had two summers ago, and think we should build on that.

I got a very strong feeling from revisiting the campus that we should have kept going with the blogging we started at Berkman in 2003, and if we had done so, I think we&#39;d be in a better position in social media today. We had a jump on Twitter, Facebook (which was also starting on campus at the same time). And we were doing everything with open protocols, all parts replaceable. Very different from the way the commercial networks are built.

What I&#39;m working on these days is primarily [WordLand](https://wordland.social/), where feeds and words get together using nothing but the open web, with all parts replaceable.

We use WordPress, via its REST API, as the platform for writing, we add a beautiful and simple new writer&#39;s toolkit, all in one place with all the administrative stuff out of the way.

This product will also introduce an API that makes it easy for developers to create new editors because there are a lot of types of editors and people have their favorites.

I&#39;m working closely with the people of WordPress, gave a demo at WordCamp Canada a couple of weeks ago. I loved it, a lot of the energy of BloggerCon. I wish I had joined them years earlier. Their community has been growing for 20+ years. In tech that&#39;s a long time.

It&#39;s also been about 20 years since we finished work on RSS 2.0, and that&#39;s the other major thing WordLand is built around. It&#39;s how messages fly around the net. Again totally replaceable parts.

Berkman helped us with RSS 2.0, the official spec is [hosted](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html) at [cyber.harvard.edu](http://cyber.harvard.edu/), and hopefully will remain there as an artifact, a basis for interop, for perpetuity.

I want a continuing stream of innovation to come out of academia, with people returning to teach what they learned to students who came to get skills that will help them do good and make a good living, and then a few years later they come back, again and again. It should be a self-renewing process.

I wrote about this several times over the last decade or so, I call this idea [Developing Better Developers](https://this.how/phoenix/).

I think the next best thing for now would be to have a homecoming for Berkman every two summers perhaps, where we get a chance to develop a pulse. And see where that goes. It&#39;s obviously a lot of work. The one we had brought back a lot of good ideas and friendships that we should still be working on together.

I live in the Catskills btw, as you can tell from the subject line, just west of Kingston. Before that I spent nine years in Manhattan, before that Berkeley, Seattle, places like that. And Cambridge of course! :-)

Dave

PS: At the reunion I remember telling David Weinberger that I had hung up my [spurs](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/hang+up+your+spurs), I was done developing. It turned out I wasn&#39;t done. Heh. I think people like me never hang em up voluntarily. Who knows. ;-)

If the page <code>2025-portugal/index</code> links to a local file, say <code>image.jpg</code>, then the result is <code>2025-portugal/image.jpg</code>. But if <code>2025-portugal</code> just reads the index file in the background, then the result of the link is <code>image.jpg</code>! The browser computes the link target based on its current URL and reading a file from a subdirectory without telling the browser breaks all these links.

      <source:markdown># 2025-11-03 Gemini and Gopher support for this site

This blog is also accessible via [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)) and [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)).

I recently did some tinkering with my [Patched Satellite](https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git/) and my [Markdown Gopher](https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/) to get things working for my [2025 Portugal](2025-portugal/index) post.

The main problem was that if I link to the directory ( `2025-portugal`) then the web redirects to the index file ( `index`).

Patched Satellite didn’t do this. It tried to read the `index.gmi` file that wasn’t there. The first fix was to read the `index.md` fix if possible. But that still didn’t work because all the images didn’t load. This has to do with relative URLs. If the page `2025-portugal/index` links to a local file, say `image.jpg`, then the result is `2025-portugal/image.jpg`. But if `2025-portugal` just reads the index file in the background, then the result of the link is `image.jpg`! The browser computes the link target based on its current URL and reading a file from a subdirectory without telling the browser breaks all these links. So I needed either some processing for all links, or a redirect from `2025-portugal` to `2025-portugal/index`. And that’s what I did.

For Markdown Gopher the problem was worse: By default, when visiting a directory, it takes the index file and tries to show a menu with all the “linked list items”. This works well if the file called “index” actually is an index to other pages. But in the 2025 Portugal case, the index page is just a page with regular links. The menu was effectively empty, resulting in an empty response. I was very confused. What I’m doing now is I count the number of “linked list items”. If that number is 0, I create return a single menu line saying “please follow this redirect” (manually!) to the same index file, but now using item type 0 (text) instead of item type 1 (menu).

There probably a way to fix this by moving the decision “up” to the menu above. When displaying the main page, I could check every local link target and if it points to a directory, check the index file, and if it doesn’t have “linked list items” create a text item, otherwise a menu item. That seems like a lot of compute for a relatively rare situation. So for the moment, “manual redirects” it is.

      <title>GSoC 2025: Introducing an ABI Lowering Library</title>
      <link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-25-abi-library/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1><p>In this post I&rsquo;m going to outline details about a new ABI lowering library I&rsquo;ve been developing for LLVM as part of GSoC 2025! The aim was to extract the ABI logic from Clang and create a reusable library that any LLVM frontend can use for correct C interoperability.</p><h1 id="the-problem-were-solving">The Problem We&rsquo;re Solving</h1><p>At the start of the program, I wrote about the <a href="https://vortex73.github.io/rendered/GSOC_BLOG1.html">fundamental gap in LLVM&rsquo;s target abstraction</a>. The promise is simple: frontends emit LLVM IR, and LLVM handles everything else. But this promise completely breaks down when it comes to Application Binary Interface (ABI) lowering. Every LLVM frontend that wants C interoperability has to reimplement thousands of lines of target-specific ABI logic.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what that looks like in practice:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Point</span> { <span style="color:#66d9ef">float</span> x, y; };</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Point</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">add_points</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Point</span> a, <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Point</span> b);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Seems innocent enough, right? But generating correct LLVM IR for this requires knowing:</p><ul><li>Are the struct arguments passed in registers or memory?</li><li>If in registers, what register class is used?</li><li>Are multiple values packed into a single register?</li><li>Is the struct returned in registers or using a hidden return parameter?</li></ul><p>The answer depends on subtle ABI rules that are target-specific, constantly evolving, and absolutely critical to get right. Miss one detail and you get silent memory corruption.</p><p><a href="https://clang.godbolt.org/z/P4fMj7hjY">This godbolt link</a> shows the same simple struct using six different calling conventions across six different targets. And crucially: a frontend generating IR needs to know ALL of this before it can emit the right function signature.</p><p>As I outlined in my earlier blog post, LLVM&rsquo;s type system simply can&rsquo;t express all the information needed for correct ABI decisions. Two otherwise identical structs with different explicit alignment attributes have different ABIs. <code>__int128</code> and <code>_BitInt(128)</code> look similar but follow completely different rules.</p><h1 id="the-design">The Design</h1><div style="margin:0 auto;"> <img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/abi_flow.png"><br/></div><h2 id="independent-abi-type-system">Independent ABI Type System</h2><p>At the heart of the library is <code>llvm::abi::Type</code>, a type system designed specifically for ABI decisions:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Type</span> {</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">protected</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> TypeKind Kind;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> TypeSize SizeInBits;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> Align ABIAlignment;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> TypeKind getKind() <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> { <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> Kind;

      <source:markdown># Introduction

In this post I’m going to outline details about a new ABI lowering library I’ve been developing for LLVM as part of GSoC 2025! The aim was to extract the ABI logic from Clang and create a reusable library that any LLVM frontend can use for correct C interoperability.

# The Problem We’re Solving

At the start of the program, I wrote about the [fundamental gap in LLVM’s target abstraction](https://vortex73.github.io/rendered/GSOC_BLOG1.html). The promise is simple: frontends emit LLVM IR, and LLVM handles everything else. But this promise completely breaks down when it comes to Application Binary Interface (ABI) lowering. Every LLVM frontend that wants C interoperability has to reimplement thousands of lines of target-specific ABI logic.

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

```cpp
struct Point { float x, y; };struct Point add_points(struct Point a, struct Point b);
```

Seems innocent enough, right? But generating correct LLVM IR for this requires knowing:

- Are the struct arguments passed in registers or memory?
- If in registers, what register class is used?
- Are multiple values packed into a single register?
- Is the struct returned in registers or using a hidden return parameter?

The answer depends on subtle ABI rules that are target-specific, constantly evolving, and absolutely critical to get right. Miss one detail and you get silent memory corruption.

[This godbolt link](https://clang.godbolt.org/z/P4fMj7hjY) shows the same simple struct using six different calling conventions across six different targets. And crucially: a frontend generating IR needs to know ALL of this before it can emit the right function signature.

As I outlined in my earlier blog post, LLVM’s type system simply can’t express all the information needed for correct ABI decisions. Two otherwise identical structs with different explicit alignment attributes have different ABIs. `__int128` and `_BitInt(128)` look similar but follow completely different rules.

# The Design

![](https://blog.llvm.org/img/abi_flow.png)

## Independent ABI Type System

At the heart of the library is `llvm::abi::Type`, a type system designed specifically for ABI decisions:

```cpp
class Type {protected: TypeKind Kind; TypeSize SizeInBits; Align ABIAlignment;public: TypeKind getKind() const { return Kind; } TypeSize getSizeInBits() const { return SizeInBits; } Align getAlignment() const { return ABIAlignment; } bool isInteger() const { return Kind == TypeKind::Integer; } bool isStruct() const { return Kind == TypeKind::Struct; } // ... other predicates that matter for ABI};
```

It contains **more information than LLVM IR types** (which for instance doesn’t distinguish between `__int128` and `_BitInt(128)`, both just `i128`), but **less information than frontend types** like Clang’s QualType (which carry parsing context, sugar, and other frontend-specific concerns that don’t matter for calling conventions).

```cpp
class IntegerType : public Type {private: bool IsSigned; bool IsBitInt; // Crucially different from __int128!public: IntegerType(uint64_t BitWidth, Align Align, bool Signed, bool BitInt = false);};
```

## Frontend-to-ABI Mapping

The `QualTypeMapper` class handles the job of converting Clang frontend types to ABI types.

**The ABI library is primarily intended to handle the C ABI.** The C type system is relatively simple, and as such the type mapping from frontend types to ABI types is straightforward : integers map to `IntegerType`, pointers map to `PointerType`, and structs map to `StructType` with their fields and offsets preserved.

However, Clang also needs support for the C++ ABI, and the type mapping for this case is significantly more complicated. C++ object layout involves vtables, base class subobjects, virtual inheritance, and all sorts of edge cases that need to be preserved for correct ABI decisions. Here’s an excerpt showing how `QualTypeMapper` tackles C++ inheritance:

```cpp
const llvm::abi::StructType *QualTypeMapper::convertCXXRecordType(const CXXRecordDecl *RD, bool canPassInRegs) { const ASTRecordLayout &#38;Layout = ASTCtx.getASTRecordLayout(RD); SmallVector&#60;llvm::abi::FieldInfo, 16&#62; Fields; SmallVector&#60;llvm::abi::FieldInfo, 8&#62; BaseClasses; SmallVector&#60;llvm::abi::FieldInfo, 8&#62; VirtualBaseClasses; // Handle vtable pointer for polymorphic classes if (RD-&#62;isPolymorphic()) { const llvm::abi::Type *VtablePointer = createPointerTypeForPointee(ASTCtx.VoidPtrTy); Fields.emplace_back(VtablePointer, 0); } // Process base classes with proper offset calculation for (const auto &#38;Base : RD-&#62;bases()) { const llvm::abi::Type *BaseType = convertType(Base.getType()); uint64_t BaseOffset = Layout.getBaseClassOffset( Base.getType()-&#62;castAs&#60;RecordType&#62;()-&#62;getAsCXXRecordDecl() ).getQuantity() * 8; if (Base.isVirtual()) VirtualBaseClasses.emplace_back(BaseType, BaseOffset); else BaseClasses.emplace_back(BaseType, BaseOffset); } // ... field processing and final struct creation}
```

Other frontends that only need C interoperability will have a much simpler mapping task.

## Target-Specific Classification

Each target implements the ABIInfo interface. I’ll show the BPF implementation here since it’s one of the simplest ABIs in LLVM, the classification logic fits in about 50 lines of code with straightforward rules: small aggregates go in registers, larger ones are passed indirectly.

Its worth noting that most real-world ABIs are not _this_ simple - for instance targets like X86-64 are significantly more complex.

```cpp
class BPFABIInfo : public ABIInfo {private: TypeBuilder &#38;TB;public: BPFABIInfo(TypeBuilder &#38;TypeBuilder) : TB(TypeBuilder) {} ABIArgInfo classifyArgumentType(const Type *ArgTy) const { if (isAggregateTypeForABI(ArgTy)) { auto SizeInBits = ArgTy-&#62;getSizeInBits().getFixedValue(); if (SizeInBits == 0) return ABIArgInfo::getIgnore(); if (SizeInBits &#60;= 128) { const Type *CoerceTy; if (SizeInBits &#60;= 64) { auto AlignedBits = alignTo(SizeInBits, 8); CoerceTy = TB.getIntegerType(AlignedBits, Align(8), false); } else { const Type *RegTy = TB.getIntegerType(64, Align(8), false); CoerceTy = TB.getArrayType(RegTy, 2, 128); } return ABIArgInfo::getDirect(CoerceTy); } return ABIArgInfo::getIndirect(ArgTy-&#62;getAlignment().value()); } if (const auto *IntTy = dyn_cast&#60;IntegerType&#62;(ArgTy)) { auto BitWidth = IntTy-&#62;getSizeInBits().getFixedValue(); if (IntTy-&#62;isBitInt() &#38;&#38; BitWidth &#62; 128) return ABIArgInfo::getIndirect(ArgTy-&#62;getAlignment().value()); if (isPromotableInteger(IntTy)) return ABIArgInfo::getExtend(ArgTy); } return ABIArgInfo::getDirect(); }};
```

The key difference is that the ABI classification logic itself is **completely independent of Clang**. Any LLVM frontend can use it by implementing a mapper from their types to `llvm::abi::Type`. The library then performs ABI classification and outputs `llvm::abi::ABIFunctionInfo` with all the lowering decisions.

For Clang specifically, the `ABITypeMapper` converts those `llvm::abi::Type` results back into `llvm::Type` and populates `clang::CGFunctionInfo`, which then continues through the normal IR generation pipeline.

# Results

The library and the new type system are implemented and working in the [PR #140112](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/140112), currently enabled for BPF and X86-64 Linux targets. You can find the implementation under `llvm/lib/ABI/` with Clang integration in `clang/lib/CodeGen/CGCall.cpp`. Here’s what we’ve achieved so far:

## Clean Architecture

The three-layer separation is working beautifully. Frontend concerns, ABI classification, and IR generation are now properly separated:

```cpp
// Integration point in Clangif (CGM.shouldUseLLVMABI()) { SmallVector&#60;const llvm::abi::Type *, 8&#62; MappedArgTypes; for (CanQualType ArgType : argTypes) MappedArgTypes.push_back(getMapper().convertType(ArgType)); tempFI.reset(llvm::abi::ABIFunctionInfo::create( CC, getMapper().convertType(resultType), MappedArgTypes)); CGM.fetchABIInfo(getTypeBuilder()).computeInfo(*tempFI);} else { CGM.getABIInfo().computeInfo(*FI); // Legacy path}
```

## Performance Considerations Addressed

My earlier blog post worried about the overhead of “an additional type system.” The caching strategy handles this elegantly:

```cpp
const llvm::abi::Type *QualTypeMapper::convertType(QualType QT) { QT = QT.getCanonicalType().getUnqualifiedType(); auto It = TypeCache.find(QT); if (It != TypeCache.end()) return It-&#62;second; // Cache hit - no recomputation const llvm::abi::Type *Result = /* conversion logic */; if (Result) TypeCache[QT] = Result; return Result;}
```

Combined with `BumpPtrAllocator` for type storage, the performance impact is minimal in practice.

![](https://blog.llvm.org/img/abi_library_benchmarks.png)

The results are encouraging. Most compilation stages show essentially no performance difference (well within measurement noise). The 0.20% regression in the final Clang build times is expected - we’ve added new code to the codebase. But the actual compilation performance impact is negligible.

# Future Work

There’s still plenty to explore:

## Upstreaming the progress so far…

The work is being upstreamed to LLVM in stages, starting with [PR #158329](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/158329). This involves addressing reviewer feedback, ensuring compatibility with existing code, and validating that the new system produces identical results to the current implementation for all supported targets.

## Extended Target Support

Currently the ABI library supports the BPF and X86-64 SysV ABIs, but the architecture makes adding ARM, Windows calling conventions, and other targets straightforward.

## Cross-Frontend Compatibility

The real test will be when other frontends start using the library. We need to ensure that all frontends generate identical calling conventions for the same C function signature.

## Better Integration

There are still some rough edges in the Clang integration that could be smoothed out. And other LLVM projects could benefit from adopting the library.

# Acknowledgements

This work wouldn’t have been possible without my amazing mentors, Nikita Popov and Maksim Levental, who provided invaluable guidance throughout the project. The LLVM community’s feedback on the [original RFC](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-an-abi-lowering-library-for-llvm/84495) was instrumental in shaping the design.

Special thanks to everyone who reviewed the code, provided feedback, and helped navigate all the ABI corner cases. The architecture only works because it’s built on decades of accumulated ABI knowledge that was already present in LLVM and Clang.

Looking back at my precursor blog post from earlier this year, I’m amazed at how much the design evolved during implementation. What started as a relatively straightforward “extract Clang’s ABI code” became a much more ambitious architectural rework. But the result is something that’s genuinely useful for the entire LLVM ecosystem.</source:markdown>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Two interesting new papers regarding LLM security and prompt injection came to my attention this weekend.</p>
        <h4 id="agents-rule-of-two-a-practical-approach-to-ai-agent-security">Agents Rule of Two: A Practical Approach to AI Agent Security</h4>
        <p>The first is <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/practical-ai-agent-security/">Agents Rule of Two: A Practical Approach to AI Agent Security</a>, published on October 31st on the Meta AI blog. It doesn't list authors but it was <a href="https://x.com/MickAyzenberg/status/1984355145917088235">shared on Twitter</a> by Meta AI security researcher Mick Ayzenberg.</p>
        <p>It proposes a "Rule of Two" that's inspired by both my own <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">lethal trifecta</a> concept and the Google Chrome team's <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md">Rule Of 2</a> for writing code that works with untrustworthy inputs:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>At a high level, the Agents Rule of Two states that until robustness research allows us to reliably detect and refuse prompt injection, agents <strong>must satisfy no more than two</strong> of the following three properties within a session to avoid the highest impact consequences of prompt injection.</p>
        <p><strong>[A]</strong> An agent can process untrustworthy inputs</p>
        <p><strong>[B]</strong> An agent can have access to sensitive systems or private data</p>
        <p><strong>[C]</strong> An agent can change state or communicate externally</p>
        <p>It's still possible that all three properties are necessary to carry out a request. If an agent requires all three without starting a new session (i.e., with a fresh context window), then the agent should not be permitted to operate autonomously and at a minimum requires supervision --- via human-in-the-loop approval or another reliable means of validation.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's accompanied by this handy diagram:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/agents-rule-of-two-updated.jpg" alt="Venn diagram titled &quot;Choose Two&quot; showing three overlapping circles labeled A, B, and C. Circle A (top): &quot;Process untrustworthy inputs&quot; with description &quot;Externally authored data may contain prompt injection attacks that turn an agent malicious.&quot; Circle B (bottom left): &quot;Access to sensitive systems or private data&quot; with description &quot;This includes private user data, company secrets, production settings and configs, source code, and other sensitive data.&quot; Circle C (bottom right): &quot;Change state or communicate externally&quot; with description &quot;Overwrite or change state through write actions, or transmitting data to a threat actor through web requests or tool calls.&quot; The two-way overlaps between circles are labeled &quot;Lower risk&quot; while the center where all three circles overlap is labeled &quot;Danger&quot;." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>I like this <em>a lot</em>.</p>
        <p>I've spent several years now trying to find clear ways to explain the risks of prompt injection attacks to developers who are building on top of LLMs. It's frustratingly difficult.</p>
        <p>I've had the most success with the lethal trifecta, which boils one particular class of prompt injection attack down to a simple-enough model: if your system has access to private data, exposure to untrusted content and a way to communicate externally then it's vulnerable to private data being stolen.</p>
        <p>The one problem with the lethal trifecta is that it only covers the risk of data exfiltration: there are plenty of other, even nastier risks that arise from prompt injection attacks against LLM-powered agents with access to tools which the lethal trifecta doesn't cover.</p>
        <p>The Agents Rule of Two neatly solves this, through the addition of "changing state" as a property to consider. This brings other forms of tool usage into the picture: anything that can change state triggered by untrustworthy inputs is something to be very cautious about.</p>
        <p>It's also refreshing to see another major research lab concluding that prompt injection remains an unsolved problem, and attempts to block or filter them have not proven reliable enough to depend on. The current solution is to design systems with this in mind, and the Rule of Two is a solid way to think about that.</p>
        <p id="exception"><strong>Update</strong>: On thinking about this further there's one aspect of the Rule of Two model that doesn't work for me: the Venn diagram above marks the combination of untrustworthy inputs and the ability to change state as "safe", but that's not right. Even without access to private systems or sensitive data that pairing can still produce harmful results. Unfortunately adding an exception for that pair undermines the simplicity of the "Rule of Two" framing!</p>
        <p id="update-2"><strong>Update 2</strong>: Mick Ayzenberg responded to this note in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45794245#45802448">a comment on Hacker News</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Thanks for the feedback! One small bit of clarification, the framework would describe access to any sensitive system as part of the [B] circle, not only private systems or private data.</p>
        <p>The intention is that an agent that has removed [B] can write state and communicate freely, but not with any systems that matter (wrt critical security outcomes for its user). An example of an agent in this state would be one that can take actions in a tight sandbox or is isolated from production.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Meta team also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45794245#45802046">updated their post</a> to replace "safe" with "lower risk" as the label on the intersections between the different circles. I've updated my screenshots of their diagrams in this post, <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/agents-rule-of-two.jpg">here's the original</a> for comparison.</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>Two interesting new papers regarding LLM security and prompt injection came to my attention this weekend.

#### Agents Rule of Two: A Practical Approach to AI Agent Security

The first is [Agents Rule of Two: A Practical Approach to AI Agent Security](https://ai.meta.com/blog/practical-ai-agent-security/), published on October 31st on the Meta AI blog. It doesn&#39;t list authors but it was [shared on Twitter](https://x.com/MickAyzenberg/status/1984355145917088235) by Meta AI security researcher Mick Ayzenberg.

It proposes a &#34;Rule of Two&#34; that&#39;s inspired by both my own [lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) concept and the Google Chrome team&#39;s [Rule Of 2](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md) for writing code that works with untrustworthy inputs:

&#62; At a high level, the Agents Rule of Two states that until robustness research allows us to reliably detect and refuse prompt injection, agents **must satisfy no more than two** of the following three properties within a session to avoid the highest impact consequences of prompt injection.
&#62;
&#62; **\[A\]** An agent can process untrustworthy inputs
&#62;
&#62; **\[B\]** An agent can have access to sensitive systems or private data
&#62;
&#62; **\[C\]** An agent can change state or communicate externally
&#62;
&#62; It&#39;s still possible that all three properties are necessary to carry out a request. If an agent requires all three without starting a new session (i.e., with a fresh context window), then the agent should not be permitted to operate autonomously and at a minimum requires supervision --- via human-in-the-loop approval or another reliable means of validation.

It&#39;s accompanied by this handy diagram:

![Venn diagram titled &#34;Choose Two&#34; showing three overlapping circles labeled A, B, and C. Circle A (top): &#34;Process untrustworthy inputs&#34; with description &#34;Externally authored data may contain prompt injection attacks that turn an agent malicious.&#34; Circle B (bottom left): &#34;Access to sensitive systems or private data&#34; with description &#34;This includes private user data, company secrets, production settings and configs, source code, and other sensitive data.&#34; Circle C (bottom right): &#34;Change state or communicate externally&#34; with description &#34;Overwrite or change state through write actions, or transmitting data to a threat actor through web requests or tool calls.&#34; The two-way overlaps between circles are labeled &#34;Lower risk&#34; while the center where all three circles overlap is labeled &#34;Danger&#34;.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/agents-rule-of-two-updated.jpg)

I like this _a lot_.

I&#39;ve spent several years now trying to find clear ways to explain the risks of prompt injection attacks to developers who are building on top of LLMs. It&#39;s frustratingly difficult.

I&#39;ve had the most success with the lethal trifecta, which boils one particular class of prompt injection attack down to a simple-enough model: if your system has access to private data, exposure to untrusted content and a way to communicate externally then it&#39;s vulnerable to private data being stolen.

The one problem with the lethal trifecta is that it only covers the risk of data exfiltration: there are plenty of other, even nastier risks that arise from prompt injection attacks against LLM-powered agents with access to tools which the lethal trifecta doesn&#39;t cover.

The Agents Rule of Two neatly solves this, through the addition of &#34;changing state&#34; as a property to consider. This brings other forms of tool usage into the picture: anything that can change state triggered by untrustworthy inputs is something to be very cautious about.

It&#39;s also refreshing to see another major research lab concluding that prompt injection remains an unsolved problem, and attempts to block or filter them have not proven reliable enough to depend on. The current solution is to design systems with this in mind, and the Rule of Two is a solid way to think about that.

**Update**: On thinking about this further there&#39;s one aspect of the Rule of Two model that doesn&#39;t work for me: the Venn diagram above marks the combination of untrustworthy inputs and the ability to change state as &#34;safe&#34;, but that&#39;s not right. Even without access to private systems or sensitive data that pairing can still produce harmful results. Unfortunately adding an exception for that pair undermines the simplicity of the &#34;Rule of Two&#34; framing!

**Update 2**: Mick Ayzenberg responded to this note in [a comment on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45794245#45802448):

&#62; Thanks for the feedback! One small bit of clarification, the framework would describe access to any sensitive system as part of the \[B\] circle, not only private systems or private data.
&#62;
&#62; The intention is that an agent that has removed \[B\] can write state and communicate freely, but not with any systems that matter (wrt critical security outcomes for its user). An example of an agent in this state would be one that can take actions in a tight sandbox or is isolated from production.

The Meta team also [updated their post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45794245#45802046) to replace &#34;safe&#34; with &#34;lower risk&#34; as the label on the intersections between the different circles. I&#39;ve updated my screenshots of their diagrams in this post, [here&#39;s the original](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/agents-rule-of-two.jpg) for comparison.

Which brings me to the second paper...

#### The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against LLM Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections

This paper is dated 10th October 2025 [on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09023) and comes from a heavy-hitting team of 14 authors - Milad Nasr, Nicholas Carlini, Chawin Sitawarin, Sander V. Schulhoff, Jamie Hayes, Michael Ilie, Juliette Pluto, Shuang Song, Harsh Chaudhari, Ilia Shumailov, Abhradeep Thakurta, Kai Yuanqing Xiao, Andreas Terzis, Florian Tramèr - including representatives from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind.

The paper looks at 12 published defenses against prompt injection and jailbreaking and subjects them to a range of &#34;adaptive attacks&#34; - attacks that are allowed to expend considerable effort iterating multiple times to try and find a way through.

The defenses did not fare well:

&#62; By systematically tuning and scaling general optimization techniques—gradient descent, reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration—we bypass 12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally reported near-zero attack success rates.

Notably the &#34;Human red-teaming setting&#34; scored 100%, defeating all defenses. That red-team consisted of 500 participants in an online competition they ran with a $20,000 prize fund.

The key point of the paper is that static example attacks - single string prompts designed to bypass systems - are an almost useless way to evaluate these defenses. Adaptive attacks are far more powerful, as shown by this chart:

![Bar chart showing Attack Success Rate (%) for various security systems across four categories: Prompting, Training, Filtering Model, and Secret Knowledge. The chart compares three attack types shown in the legend: Static / weak attack (green hatched bars), Automated attack (ours) (orange bars), and Human red-teaming (ours) (purple dotted bars). Systems and their success rates are: Spotlighting (28% static, 99% automated), Prompt Sandwich (21% static, 95% automated), RPO (0% static, 99% automated), Circuit Breaker (8% static, 100% automated), StruQ (62% static, 100% automated), SeqAlign (5% static, 96% automated), ProtectAI (15% static, 90% automated), PromptGuard (26% static, 94% automated), PIGuard (0% static, 71% automated), Model Armor (0% static, 90% automated), Data Sentinel (0% static, 80% automated), MELON (0% static, 89% automated), and Human red-teaming setting (0% static, 100% human red-teaming).](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/attack-success-rate.jpg)

The three automated adaptive attack techniques used by the paper are:

- **Gradient-based methods** \- these were the least effective, using the technique described in the legendary [Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043) paper [from 2023](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/27/universal-and-transferable-attacks-on-aligned-language-models/).
- **Reinforcement learning methods** \- particularly effective against black-box models: &#34;we allowed the attacker model to interact directly with the defended system and observe its outputs&#34;, using 32 sessions of 5 rounds each.
- **Search-based methods** \- generate candidates with an LLM, then evaluate and further modify them using LLM-as-judge and other classifiers.

The paper concludes somewhat optimistically:

&#62; \[...\] Adaptive evaluations are therefore more challenging to perform,
&#62; making it all the more important that they are performed. We again urge defense authors to release simple, easy-to-prompt defenses that are amenable to human analysis. \[...\] Finally, we hope that our analysis here will increase the standard for defense evaluations, and in so doing, increase the likelihood that reliable jailbreak and prompt injection defenses will be developed.

Given how totally the defenses were defeated, I do not share their optimism that reliable defenses will be developed any time soon.

As a review of how far we still have to go this paper packs a powerful punch. I think it makes a strong case for Meta&#39;s Agents Rule of Two as the best practical advice for building secure LLM-powered agent systems today in the absence of prompt injection defenses we can rely on.

      <source:markdown>Authentication on the web is a complicated problem. If you’re going to do it yourself, there’s _a lot_ you have to take into consideration.

But odds are, you’re building an app whose core offering has nothing to do with auth. You don’t care about auth. It’s an implementation detail.

So rather than spend your precious time solving the problem of auth, you pay someone else to solve it.

That’s the value of SaaS.

What would be the point of paying for an authentication service, like workOS, then re-implementing auth on your own? They have dedicated teams working on that problem. It’s unlikely you’re going to do it better than them _and_ still deliver on the product you’re building.

There’s a parallel here, I think, to building stuff in the browser.

Browsers provide lots of features to help you deliver good websites fast to an incredibly broad and diverse audience.

Browser makers have teams of people who, day-in and day-out, are spending lots of time developing and optimizing their offerings.

So if you leverage what they offer you, that gives you an advantage because you don’t have to build it yourself.

You _could_ build it yourself. You could say “No thanks, I don’t want what you have. I’ll make my own.”

But you don’t have to. And odds are, whatever you do build yourself, is not likely to be as fast as the [highly-optimized subsystems you can tie together in the browser](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/more-control-equals-less-performance/).

And the best part? Unlike SaaS, you don’t have to pay for what the browser offers you.

And because you’re not paying, it can’t be turned off if you stop paying.

`@view-transition`, for example, is a free API that’ll work forever.

That’s a great deal. Are you taking advantage?

      <source:markdown>Hey everyone!

This is the list of all the changes we&#39;ve done to our projects during the month of October.

![little ninj, a small ninja, is leaning happily on a pumpkin bearing the face of the Hollow creature from Scavengers Reign](../media/content/videos/october_2025.jpg)

- **[CCCC](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/cccc)**, added a factorization mode.
- **[Bagel](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/bagel)**, wrote about a cursed programming language idea where instead of cons cells, s-exp represent unordered lists.
- **[Rabbit Waves](../site/rabbitwaves.html)**, released a new page called [Celestial Compass](https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/celestial_compass.html), and added [a button](https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/about.html) for those who wish to link to the website from theirs.
- **[Punk Rabbits](https://kokorobot.ca/site/punk_rabbits.html)**, completed 2 new rabbits(#55 and 56).

We sailed Pino back to Victoria before heading east for [AMP Festival 2025](https://ampindustrialevents.com). The venue was packed! The [Aliceffekt show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObCjiUWll7g)(YouTube) started with a bit of _radio taiso_, to make sure everyone had a chance to limber up, it was pretty funny.

As the trees were shedding the last of their leaves, members of the Merveilles community composed a [spooky mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmmU1voBVeU)( [download](https://matecha.net/hallow_2025.mp3)), and we folded paper to craft ourselves some homemade Halloween [masks](https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/11/01.html). Like every year, we carved a [pumpkin](halloween_pumpkins.html). This year&#39;s design was inspired by the [Hollow creature](../media/content/inventory/pumpkin_hollow.jpg) from the amazing animated sci-fi series _Scavengers Reign_.

We spent the rest of the month with family, seeing friends and reviewing [microgrant applications](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2025/sep/15/open-call-microgrants-2025/) for Rhizome.

We have re-opened the [store](../site/store.html) for sticker sales, but at the moment we cannot ship them to the US due to the [suspension of the de minimis exemption](https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/support/campaign/shipping-to-us-duty-updates.page). We hope to resume shipments as soon as we can figure out how to comply with the new shipping rules. The sale of our physical books to the US is unaffected. We&#39;ll end this update with the mention that [Oquonie](../site/oquonie.html) is part of the [Playdate Catalogue fall sale](https://play.date/games/oquonie/) lasting until Nov 13, 2025. Thank you to everyone who continue to explore our strange little world.

**Book Club:** This month we are reading _The Outsiders_ by Susan E. Hinton, and _Madame Bovary: Provincial Manners_ by Gustave Flaubert.

        Back in January of this year I decided to leave <a
        href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, and start managing my bookmarks
        myself. I had been using the service for almost 15 years, so it was kind
        of a big change. The reasons for the move were that Pinboard had seemed
        increasingly unstable, and I discovered that the site owner had
        expressed some political views that didn’t align very well with my own.
        Plus, I had wanted to see what other tools were like, especially open
        source options.
        </p>
        <p>
        After experimenting with a few different tools I landed (for the time
        being) on running <a
        href="https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori">Shiori</a> at home on a
        Raspberry Pi. I was able to import my historical bookmarks from
        Pinboard, and it has been working pretty well for me so far.
        </p>
        <p>
        One thing I miss a little bit is being able to share what I’m reading
        publicly. So over the weekend I wrote a small <a
        href="https://github.com/edsu/inkdroid.org/blob/main/_scripts/shiori.rb">utility</a>
        that talks to the Shiori API and writes a summary of what I’ve been
        reading this week as a post here. Since this site is still running with
        Jekyll, it’s a small bit of Ruby that runs from cron every Sunday
        evening. You can see an example of one of these <a

requirements needed.

## 🔖 [Technodiversity, permacomputing and anticapitalism](https://critical-switch.org/en/posts/technodiversity-permacomputing-and-anticapitalism/)

Help articulate a critical theoretical framework that can serve as a
base for social movements: we perceive that there is a widespread loss
of historical memory and a lack of deep understanding of the origin of
our current problems, especially what ideologies have brought us here.
We want to fight the hopelessness that there is no horizon beyond
capitalism with a critical discourse that helps us feel that we can have
control over the narrative of our reality.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) has walked away from a $1.5 million
government grant and you can blame the Trump administration’s war on
woke for effectively weakening some open source security.

## 🔖 [Bartz v Anthropic FAQ](https://www.anthropiccopyrightsettlement.com/faq)

This page includes iformation about the Anthropic settlement with
copyright holders in the LibGen dataset. It is supposedly the largest
class action lawsuit involving copyright (1.5 billion $).

## 🔖 [The Platform for\ Experimental, Collaborative Ethnography (PECE)](https://worldpece.org/)

The Platform for Experimental, Collaborative Ethnography (PECE:
pronounced “peace”) is an open source (Drupal-based) digital platform
that supports multi-sited, cross-scale ethnographic and historical
research. The platform links researchers in new ways, enables new kinds
of analyses and data visualization, and activates researchers’
engagement with public problems and diverse audiences. PECE is at the
center of a research project that explores how digital infrastructure
can be designed to support collaborative hermeneutics…

## 🔖 [How Education\ Works](https://howeducationworks.ca/)

It’s about how we learn, the nature of knowledge, the very technological
nature of humanity, and the very human nature of technology. It’s about
how our participation in (not our just use of) technology brings about
knowledge and skills, and it’s about the very complex nature of how that
happens. It’s about how education, treated as a technology, actually
works rather than how it is designed to work, and why it often fails to
work or surprisingly succeeds. It’s about how what we do (the hard
methods, tools, theories, models, processes, and structures we employ)
is less important than the way that we do it (the soft technique we
bring to assemble it all). It’s about the parts we play in the cognition
of others, and the parts they play in our own. It is about what it means
to be human.</source:markdown>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature">How I Use Every Claude Code Feature</a></strong></p>
        Useful, detailed guide from Shrivu Shankar, a Claude Code power user. Lots of tips for both individual Claude Code usage and configuring it for larger team projects.</p>
        <p>I appreciated Shrivu's take on MCP:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The "Scripting" model (now formalized by Skills) is better, but it needs a secure way to access the environment. This to me is the new, more focused role for MCP.</p>
        <p>Instead of a bloated API, an MCP should be a simple, secure gateway that provides a few powerful, high-level tools:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>download_raw_data(filters...)</code></li>
        <li><code>take_sensitive_gated_action(args...)</code></li>
        <li><code>execute_code_in_environment_with_state(code...)</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this model, MCP's job isn't to abstract reality for the agent; its job is to manage the auth, networking, and security boundaries and then get out of the way.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This makes a lot of sense to me. Most of my MCP usage with coding agents like Claude Code has been replaced by custom shell scripts for it to execute, but there's still a useful role for MCP in helping the agent access secure resources in a controlled way.

Useful, detailed guide from Shrivu Shankar, a Claude Code power user. Lots of tips for both individual Claude Code usage and configuring it for larger team projects.

I appreciated Shrivu&#39;s take on MCP:

&#62; The &#34;Scripting&#34; model (now formalized by Skills) is better, but it needs a secure way to access the environment. This to me is the new, more focused role for MCP.
&#62;
&#62; Instead of a bloated API, an MCP should be a simple, secure gateway that provides a few powerful, high-level tools:
&#62;
&#62; - `download_raw_data(filters...)`
&#62; - `take_sensitive_gated_action(args...)`
&#62; - `execute_code_in_environment_with_state(code...)`
&#62;
&#62; In this model, MCP&#39;s job isn&#39;t to abstract reality for the agent; its job is to manage the auth, networking, and security boundaries and then get out of the way.

This makes a lot of sense to me. Most of my MCP usage with coding agents like Claude Code has been replaced by custom shell scripts for it to execute, but there&#39;s still a useful role for MCP in helping the agent access secure resources in a controlled way.

      <title>Claude Code Can Debug Low-level Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/1/claude-code-cryptography/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://words.filippo.io/claude-debugging/">Claude Code Can Debug Low-level Cryptography</a></strong></p>
        Go cryptography author Filippo Valsorda reports on some very positive results applying Claude Code to the challenge of implementing novel cryptography algorithms. After Claude was able to resolve a "fairly complex low-level bug" in fresh code he tried it against two other examples and got positive results both time.</p>
        <p>Filippo isn't directly using Claude's solutions to the bugs, but is finding it useful for tracking down the cause and saving him a solid amount of debugging work:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Three out of three one-shot debugging hits with no help is <em>extremely impressive</em>. Importantly, there is no need to trust the LLM or review its output when its job is just saving me an hour or two by telling me where the bug is, for me to reason about it and fix it.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Using coding agents in this way may represent a useful entrypoint for LLM-skeptics who wouldn't <em>dream</em> of letting an autocomplete-machine writing code on their behalf.

      <source:markdown>&#62; I plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into
&#62; APT, no earlier than May 2026. This extends at first to the
&#62; Rust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem.
&#62;
&#62; In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the
&#62; HTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit
&#62; from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to
&#62; unit testing.
&#62;
&#62; If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
&#62; please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
&#62; sunset the port.

        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-11-01-covid-19-vaccination">2025-11-01 COVID-19 vaccination</h1>
        
        <p>Yesterday, at the pharmacy here in Zürich, when we asked for a Covid shot, we were told that it was only available for people 65 and older or people at-risk. I asked whether this is a matter of who pays or whether this is a matter of the state making it illegal? And what if we want to visit our parents who are around 80? The person at the desk decided to check in with the head pharmacist and came back to say that the federal department of health changed its position this week. It’s now OK to give us the shots. We still have to pay for it.</p>
        
        <p>How strange. Was it really forbidden to vaccinate us just a week earlier?</p>
        
        <p>Reading the official position of the Swiss department of health (<a href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/de/richtlinien-und-empfehlungen-zu-impfungen-und-prophylaxe">Richtlinien und Empfehlungen zu Impfungen und Prophylaxe</a>), the plan says that it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; unless you&rsquo;re 65 or older, or at-risk. I checked the <a href="https://www.impfen-schweiz.ch/de/covid-19">Covid-19</a> site and found a sentence saying that it helped reduce the risk of post-acute sequelae. Hm, strange.</p>
        
        <p>I checked the <a href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/dam/de/sd-web/BTXB12Z7zZk5/covid-19-impfempfehlung-herbst-2022.pdf">BAG-Bulletin 38/2024</a> and it seems that if you&rsquo;re not at-risk, then the vaccination doesn&rsquo;t seem to affect the outcome they are looking for, namely: preventing a difficult course or a deadly outcome. That makes me think they&rsquo;re not taking into account all the non-dramatic but still consequential post-acute sequelae.</p>
        
        <p>I still wonder: Does vaccination help reduce the risk of post-acute sequelae if you have a light COVID-19 infection?</p>

        </blockquote>
        
        <p>So I wonder: If the only known sequelae are based on studies of critical illness and if the vaccination doesn&rsquo;t help prevent critical illness if you&rsquo;re not at-risk, does it make sense not to vaccinate if you&rsquo;re not at-risk?</p>
        
        <p>Essentially, people like me are acting on the precautionary principle: We can&rsquo;t be sure that the non-critical illness doesn&rsquo;t do subtle damage over the long term, specially on a recurring basis, so we try to do our best.</p>

      <source:markdown># 2025-11-01 COVID-19 vaccination

Yesterday, at the pharmacy here in Zürich, when we asked for a Covid shot, we were told that it was only available for people 65 and older or people at-risk. I asked whether this is a matter of who pays or whether this is a matter of the state making it illegal? And what if we want to visit our parents who are around 80? The person at the desk decided to check in with the head pharmacist and came back to say that the federal department of health changed its position this week. It’s now OK to give us the shots. We still have to pay for it.

How strange. Was it really forbidden to vaccinate us just a week earlier?

Reading the official position of the Swiss department of health ( [Richtlinien und Empfehlungen zu Impfungen und Prophylaxe](https://www.bag.admin.ch/de/richtlinien-und-empfehlungen-zu-impfungen-und-prophylaxe)), the plan says that it’s not “recommended” unless you’re 65 or older, or at-risk. I checked the [Covid-19](https://www.impfen-schweiz.ch/de/covid-19) site and found a sentence saying that it helped reduce the risk of post-acute sequelae. Hm, strange.

I checked the [BAG-Bulletin 38/2024](https://www.bag.admin.ch/dam/de/sd-web/BTXB12Z7zZk5/covid-19-impfempfehlung-herbst-2022.pdf) and it seems that if you’re not at-risk, then the vaccination doesn’t seem to affect the outcome they are looking for, namely: preventing a difficult course or a deadly outcome. That makes me think they’re not taking into account all the non-dramatic but still consequential post-acute sequelae.

I still wonder: Does vaccination help reduce the risk of post-acute sequelae if you have a light COVID-19 infection?

Then again, when I skim an article such as [Long‐Term Sequelae of COVID‐19: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis of Symptoms 3 Years Post‐SARS‐CoV‐2 Infection](https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70429) (Rahmati, 2025), I see that they describe the work as follows:

&#62; We provide an overview of the manifestations of post-COVID-19 condition after critical illness in adults. We explore the effects on various organ systems, describe potential pathophysiological mechanisms, and consider the challenges of providing clinical care and support for survivors of critical illness with multisystem manifestations.

So I wonder: If the only known sequelae are based on studies of critical illness and if the vaccination doesn’t help prevent critical illness if you’re not at-risk, does it make sense not to vaccinate if you’re not at-risk?

Essentially, people like me are acting on the precautionary principle: We can’t be sure that the non-critical illness doesn’t do subtle damage over the long term, specially on a recurring basis, so we try to do our best.

But I guess the best options are still:

- On an individual level, avoid crowds and to wear a mask if you cannot.
- On a societal level, everybody should wear a fucking mask.

Every time I see pictures of street life in Japan, I’m surprised to see so many people masking and I remember seeing a lot of people masking before the pandemic when I visited Japan and Hong Kong.

        <h2 id="problem-setting-off-policy-rl">Problem setting: off-policy RL</h2>
        
        <p>Our problem setting is <strong>off-policy RL</strong>. Let’s briefly review what this means.</p>
        
        <p>There are two classes of algorithms in RL: on-policy RL and off-policy RL. On-policy RL means we can <em>only</em> use fresh data collected by the current policy. In other words, we have to throw away old data each time we update the policy. Algorithms like PPO and GRPO (and policy gradient methods in general) belong to this category.</p>
        
        <p>Off-policy RL means we don’t have this restriction: we can use <em>any</em> kind of data, including old experience, human demonstrations, Internet data, and so on. So off-policy RL is more general and flexible than on-policy RL (and of course harder!). Q-learning is the most well-known off-policy RL algorithm. In domains where data collection is expensive (<em>e.g.</em>, <strong>robotics</strong>, dialogue systems, healthcare, etc.), we often have no choice but to use off-policy RL. That’s why it’s such an important problem.</p>
        
        <p>As of 2025, I think we have reasonably good recipes for scaling up on-policy RL (<em>e.g.</em>, PPO, GRPO, and their variants). However, we still haven’t found a “scalable” <em>off-policy RL</em> algorithm that scales well to complex, long-horizon tasks. Let me briefly explain why.</p>
        
        <h2 id="two-paradigms-in-value-learning-temporal-difference-td-and-monte-carlo-mc">Two paradigms in value learning: Temporal Difference (TD) and Monte Carlo (MC)</h2>
        
        <p>In off-policy RL, we typically train a value function using temporal difference (TD) learning (<em>i.e.</em>, Q-learning), with the following Bellman update rule:</p>
        
        \[\begin{aligned} Q(s, a) \gets r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'), \end{aligned}\]
        
        <p>The problem is this: the error in the next value $Q(s’, a’)$ propagates to the current value $Q(s, a)$ through bootstrapping, and these errors <em>accumulate</em> over the entire horizon. This is basically what makes TD learning struggle to scale to long-horizon tasks (see <a href="https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/">this post</a> if you’re interested in more details).</p>
        
        <p>To mitigate this problem, people have mixed TD learning with Monte Carlo (MC) returns. For example, we can do $n$-step TD learning (TD-$n$):</p>
        
        \[\begin{aligned} Q(s_t, a_t) \gets \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \gamma^i r_{t+i} + \gamma^n \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+n}, a'). \end{aligned}\]
        
        <p>Here, we use the actual Monte Carlo return (from the dataset) for the first $n$ steps, and then use the bootstrapped value for the rest of the horizon. This way, we can reduce the number of Bellman recursions by $n$ times, so errors accumulate less. In the extreme case of $n = \infty$, we recover pure Monte Carlo value learning.</p>
        
        <p>While this is a reasonable solution (and often <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04168">works well</a>), it is highly unsatisfactory. First, it doesn’t <em>fundamentally</em> solve the error accumulation problem; it only reduces the number of Bellman recursions by a constant factor ($n$). Second, as $n$ grows, we suffer from high variance and suboptimality. So we can’t just set $n$ to a large value, and need to carefully tune it for each task.</p>
        
        <p>Is there a fundamentally different way to solve this problem?</p>
        
        <h2 id="the-third-paradigm-divide-and-conquer">The “Third” Paradigm: Divide and Conquer</h2>
        
        <p>My claim is that a <em>third</em> paradigm in value learning, <strong>divide and conquer</strong>, may provide an ideal solution to off-policy RL that scales to arbitrarily long-horizon tasks.</p>

        <i style="font-size: 0.9em;">Divide and conquer reduces the number of Bellman recursions logarithmically.</i>
        </p>
        
        <p>The key idea of divide and conquer is to divide a trajectory into two equal-length segments, and combine their values to update the value of the full trajectory. This way, we can (in theory) reduce the number of Bellman recursions <em>logarithmically</em> (not linearly!). Moreover, it doesn’t require choosing a hyperparameter like $n$, and it doesn’t necessarily suffer from high variance or suboptimality, unlike $n$-step TD learning.</p>
        
        <p>Conceptually, divide and conquer really has all the nice properties we want in value learning. So I’ve long been excited about this high-level idea. The problem was that it wasn’t clear how to actually do this in practice… until recently.</p>
        
        <h2 id="a-practical-algorithm">A practical algorithm</h2>
        
        <p>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512">recent work</a> co-led with <a href="https://aober.ai/">Aditya</a>, we made meaningful progress toward realizing and scaling up this idea. Specifically, we were able to scale up divide-and-conquer value learning to highly complex tasks (as far as I know, this is the first such work!) at least in one important class of RL problems, <em>goal-conditioned RL</em>. Goal-conditioned RL aims to learn a policy that can reach any state from any other state. This provides a natural divide-and-conquer structure. Let me explain this.</p>
        
        <p>The structure is as follows. Let’s first assume that the dynamics is deterministic, and denote the shortest path distance (“temporal distance”) between two states $s$ and $g$ as $d^*(s, g)$. Then, it satisfies the triangle inequality:</p>
        
        \[\begin{aligned} d^*(s, g) \leq d^*(s, w) + d^*(w, g) \end{aligned}\]
        
        <p>for all $s, g, w \in \mathcal{S}$.</p>
        
        <p>In terms of values, we can equivalently translate this triangle inequality to the following <em>“transitive”</em> Bellman update rule:</p>
        
        \[\begin{aligned} 
        V(s, g) \gets \begin{cases}
        \gamma^0 &amp; \text{if } s = g, \\\\ 
        \gamma^1 &amp; \text{if } (s, g) \in \mathcal{E}, \\\\ 
        \max_{w \in \mathcal{S}} V(s, w)V(w, g) &amp; \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases} 
        \end{aligned}\]
        
        <p>where $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of edges in the environment’s transition graph, and $V$ is the value function associated with the sparse reward $r(s, g) = 1(s = g)$. <strong>Intuitively</strong>, this means that we can update the value of $V(s, g)$ using two “smaller” values: $V(s, w)$ and $V(w, g)$, provided that $w$ is the optimal “midpoint” (subgoal) on the shortest path. This is exactly the divide-and-conquer value update rule that we were looking for!</p>
        
        <h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
        
        <p>However, there’s one problem here. The issue is that it’s unclear how to choose the optimal subgoal $w$ in practice. In tabular settings, we can simply enumerate all states to find the optimal $w$ (this is essentially the Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm). But in continuous environments with large state spaces, we can’t do this. Basically, this is why previous works have struggled to scale up divide-and-conquer value learning, even though this idea has been around for decades (in fact, it dates back to the very first work in goal-conditioned RL by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;citation_for_view=IcasIiwAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC">Kaelbling (1993)</a> – see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512">our paper</a> for a further discussion of related works). The main contribution of our work is a practical solution to this issue.</p>
        
        <h3 id="the-solution">The solution</h3>
        
        <p>Here’s our key idea: we <em>restrict</em> the search space of $w$ to the states that appear in the dataset, specifically, those that lie between $s$ and $g$ in the dataset trajectory. Also, instead of searching for the optimal $\text{argmax}_w$, we compute a “soft” $\text{argmax}$ using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06169">expectile regression</a>. Namely, we minimize the following loss:</p>
        
        \[\begin{aligned} \mathbb{E}\left[\ell^2_\kappa (V(s_i, s_j) - \bar{V}(s_i, s_k) \bar{V}(s_k, s_j))\right], \end{aligned}\]
        
        <p>where $\bar{V}$ is the target value network, $\ell^2_\kappa$ is the expectile loss with an expectile $\kappa$, and the expectation is taken over all $(s_i, s_k, s_j)$ tuples with $i \leq k \leq j$ in a randomly sampled dataset trajectory.</p>
        
        <p>This has two benefits. First, we don’t need to search over the entire state space. Second, we prevent value overestimation from the $\max$ operator by instead using the “softer” expectile regression. We call this algorithm <strong>Transitive RL (TRL)</strong>.

        <p>To see whether our method scales well to complex tasks, we directly evaluated TRL on some of the most challenging tasks in <a href="https://seohong.me/projects/ogbench/">OGBench</a>, a benchmark for offline goal-conditioned RL.

TRL matches the best TD-$n$ on all tasks, <strong>without needing to set $\boldsymbol{n}$</strong>! This is exactly what we wanted from the divide-and-conquer paradigm.

        <h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
        
        <p>In this post, I shared some promising results from our new divide-and-conquer value learning algorithm, Transitive RL. This is just the beginning of the journey. There are many open questions and exciting directions to explore:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Perhaps the most important question is how to extend TRL to regular, reward-based RL tasks beyond goal-conditioned RL. Would regular RL have a similar divide-and-conquer structure that we can exploit? I’m quite optimistic about this, given that it is possible to convert any reward-based RL task to a goal-conditioned one at least in theory (see page 40 of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/goalconditioned-rl/">this book</a>).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Another important challenge is to deal with stochastic environments. The current version of TRL assumes deterministic dynamics, but many real-world environments are stochastic, mainly due to partial observability. For this, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098">“stochastic” triangle inequalities</a> might provide some hints.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Practically, I think there is still a lot of room to further improve TRL. For example, we can find better ways to choose subgoal candidates (beyond the ones from the same trajectory), further reduce hyperparameters, further stabilize training, and simplify the algorithm even more.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In general, I’m really excited about the potential of the divide-and-conquer paradigm. I <a href="https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/">still</a> think one of the most important problems in RL (and even in machine learning) is to find a <em>scalable</em> off-policy RL algorithm. I don’t know what the final solution will look like, but I do think divide and conquer, or <strong>recursive</strong> decision-making in general, is one of the strongest candidates toward this holy grail (by the way, I think the other strong contenders are (1) model-based RL and (2) TD learning with some “magic” tricks). Indeed, several recent works in other fields have shown the promise of recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies, such as <a href="https://kvfrans.com/shortcut-models/">shortcut models</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04761">log-linear attention</a>, and <a href="https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/">recursive language models</a> (and of course, classic algorithms like quicksort, segment trees, FFT, and so on). I hope to see more exciting progress in scalable off-policy RL in the near future!</p>

      <source:markdown>In this post, I’ll introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on an “alternative” paradigm: **divide and conquer**. Unlike traditional methods, this algorithm is _not_ based on temporal difference (TD) learning (which has [scalability challenges](https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/)), and scales well to long-horizon tasks.

_We can do Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on divide and conquer, instead of temporal difference (TD) learning._

## Problem setting: off-policy RL

Our problem setting is **off-policy RL**. Let’s briefly review what this means.

There are two classes of algorithms in RL: on-policy RL and off-policy RL. On-policy RL means we can _only_ use fresh data collected by the current policy. In other words, we have to throw away old data each time we update the policy. Algorithms like PPO and GRPO (and policy gradient methods in general) belong to this category.

Off-policy RL means we don’t have this restriction: we can use _any_ kind of data, including old experience, human demonstrations, Internet data, and so on. So off-policy RL is more general and flexible than on-policy RL (and of course harder!). Q-learning is the most well-known off-policy RL algorithm. In domains where data collection is expensive ( _e.g._, **robotics**, dialogue systems, healthcare, etc.), we often have no choice but to use off-policy RL. That’s why it’s such an important problem.

As of 2025, I think we have reasonably good recipes for scaling up on-policy RL ( _e.g._, PPO, GRPO, and their variants). However, we still haven’t found a “scalable” _off-policy RL_ algorithm that scales well to complex, long-horizon tasks. Let me briefly explain why.

## Two paradigms in value learning: Temporal Difference (TD) and Monte Carlo (MC)

In off-policy RL, we typically train a value function using temporal difference (TD) learning ( _i.e._, Q-learning), with the following Bellman update rule:

\\\[\\begin{aligned} Q(s, a) \\gets r + \\gamma \\max\_{a&#39;} Q(s&#39;, a&#39;), \\end{aligned}\\\]

The problem is this: the error in the next value $Q(s’, a’)$ propagates to the current value $Q(s, a)$ through bootstrapping, and these errors _accumulate_ over the entire horizon. This is basically what makes TD learning struggle to scale to long-horizon tasks (see [this post](https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/) if you’re interested in more details).

To mitigate this problem, people have mixed TD learning with Monte Carlo (MC) returns. For example, we can do $n$-step TD learning (TD-$n$):

\\\[\\begin{aligned} Q(s\_t, a\_t) \\gets \\sum\_{i=0}^{n-1} \\gamma^i r\_{t+i} + \\gamma^n \\max\_{a&#39;} Q(s\_{t+n}, a&#39;). \\end{aligned}\\\]

Here, we use the actual Monte Carlo return (from the dataset) for the first $n$ steps, and then use the bootstrapped value for the rest of the horizon. This way, we can reduce the number of Bellman recursions by $n$ times, so errors accumulate less. In the extreme case of $n = \\infty$, we recover pure Monte Carlo value learning.

While this is a reasonable solution (and often [works well](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04168)), it is highly unsatisfactory. First, it doesn’t _fundamentally_ solve the error accumulation problem; it only reduces the number of Bellman recursions by a constant factor ($n$). Second, as $n$ grows, we suffer from high variance and suboptimality. So we can’t just set $n$ to a large value, and need to carefully tune it for each task.

Is there a fundamentally different way to solve this problem?

## The “Third” Paradigm: Divide and Conquer

My claim is that a _third_ paradigm in value learning, **divide and conquer**, may provide an ideal solution to off-policy RL that scales to arbitrarily long-horizon tasks.

![](https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl-without-td-learning/teaser.png)

_Divide and conquer reduces the number of Bellman recursions logarithmically._

The key idea of divide and conquer is to divide a trajectory into two equal-length segments, and combine their values to update the value of the full trajectory. This way, we can (in theory) reduce the number of Bellman recursions _logarithmically_ (not linearly!). Moreover, it doesn’t require choosing a hyperparameter like $n$, and it doesn’t necessarily suffer from high variance or suboptimality, unlike $n$-step TD learning.

Conceptually, divide and conquer really has all the nice properties we want in value learning. So I’ve long been excited about this high-level idea. The problem was that it wasn’t clear how to actually do this in practice… until recently.

## A practical algorithm

In a [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512) co-led with [Aditya](https://aober.ai/), we made meaningful progress toward realizing and scaling up this idea. Specifically, we were able to scale up divide-and-conquer value learning to highly complex tasks (as far as I know, this is the first such work!) at least in one important class of RL problems, _goal-conditioned RL_. Goal-conditioned RL aims to learn a policy that can reach any state from any other state. This provides a natural divide-and-conquer structure. Let me explain this.

The structure is as follows. Let’s first assume that the dynamics is deterministic, and denote the shortest path distance (“temporal distance”) between two states $s$ and $g$ as $d^\*(s, g)$. Then, it satisfies the triangle inequality:

\\\[\\begin{aligned} d^\*(s, g) \\leq d^\*(s, w) + d^\*(w, g) \\end{aligned}\\\]

for all $s, g, w \\in \\mathcal{S}$.

In terms of values, we can equivalently translate this triangle inequality to the following _“transitive”_ Bellman update rule:

\\\[\\begin{aligned}
V(s, g) \\gets \\begin{cases}
\\gamma^0 &#38; \\text{if } s = g, \\\\\\
\\gamma^1 &#38; \\text{if } (s, g) \\in \\mathcal{E}, \\\\\\
\\max\_{w \\in \\mathcal{S}} V(s, w)V(w, g) &#38; \\text{otherwise}
\\end{cases}
\\end{aligned}\\\]

where $\\mathcal{E}$ is the set of edges in the environment’s transition graph, and $V$ is the value function associated with the sparse reward $r(s, g) = 1(s = g)$. **Intuitively**, this means that we can update the value of $V(s, g)$ using two “smaller” values: $V(s, w)$ and $V(w, g)$, provided that $w$ is the optimal “midpoint” (subgoal) on the shortest path. This is exactly the divide-and-conquer value update rule that we were looking for!

### The problem

However, there’s one problem here. The issue is that it’s unclear how to choose the optimal subgoal $w$ in practice. In tabular settings, we can simply enumerate all states to find the optimal $w$ (this is essentially the Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm). But in continuous environments with large state spaces, we can’t do this. Basically, this is why previous works have struggled to scale up divide-and-conquer value learning, even though this idea has been around for decades (in fact, it dates back to the very first work in goal-conditioned RL by [Kaelbling (1993)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&#38;citation_for_view=IcasIiwAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC) – see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512) for a further discussion of related works). The main contribution of our work is a practical solution to this issue.

### The solution

Here’s our key idea: we _restrict_ the search space of $w$ to the states that appear in the dataset, specifically, those that lie between $s$ and $g$ in the dataset trajectory. Also, instead of searching for the optimal $\\text{argmax}\_w$, we compute a “soft” $\\text{argmax}$ using [expectile regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06169). Namely, we minimize the following loss:

\\\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}\\left\[\\ell^2\_\\kappa (V(s\_i, s\_j) - \\bar{V}(s\_i, s\_k) \\bar{V}(s\_k, s\_j))\\right\], \\end{aligned}\\\]

where $\\bar{V}$ is the target value network, $\\ell^2\_\\kappa$ is the expectile loss with an expectile $\\kappa$, and the expectation is taken over all $(s\_i, s\_k, s\_j)$ tuples with $i \\leq k \\leq j$ in a randomly sampled dataset trajectory.

This has two benefits. First, we don’t need to search over the entire state space. Second, we prevent value overestimation from the $\\max$ operator by instead using the “softer” expectile regression. We call this algorithm **Transitive RL (TRL)**. Check out [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512) for more details and further discussions!

## Does it work well?

To see whether our method scales well to complex tasks, we directly evaluated TRL on some of the most challenging tasks in [OGBench](https://seohong.me/projects/ogbench/), a benchmark for offline goal-conditioned RL. We mainly used the hardest versions of humanoidmaze and puzzle tasks with large, 1B-sized datasets. These tasks are highly challenging: they require performing combinatorially complex skills across up to **3,000 environment steps**.

![](https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl-without-td-learning/table.png)

_TRL achieves the best performance on highly challenging, long-horizon tasks._

The results are quite exciting! Compared to many strong baselines across different categories (TD, MC, quasimetric learning, etc.), TRL achieves the best performance on most tasks.

![](https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl-without-td-learning/1b.svg)

_TRL matches the best, individually tuned TD-$n$, **without needing to set $\\boldsymbol{n}$**._

This is my favorite plot. We compared TRL with $n$-step TD learning with different values of $n$, from $1$ (pure TD) to $\\infty$ (pure MC). The result is really nice. TRL matches the best TD-$n$ on all tasks, **without needing to set $\\boldsymbol{n}$**! This is exactly what we wanted from the divide-and-conquer paradigm. By recursively splitting a trajectory into smaller ones, it can _naturally_ handle long horizons, without having to arbitrarily choose the length of trajectory chunks.

The paper has a lot of additional experiments, analyses, and ablations. If you’re interested, check out [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512)!

## What’s next?

In this post, I shared some promising results from our new divide-and-conquer value learning algorithm, Transitive RL. This is just the beginning of the journey. There are many open questions and exciting directions to explore:

- Perhaps the most important question is how to extend TRL to regular, reward-based RL tasks beyond goal-conditioned RL. Would regular RL have a similar divide-and-conquer structure that we can exploit? I’m quite optimistic about this, given that it is possible to convert any reward-based RL task to a goal-conditioned one at least in theory (see page 40 of [this book](https://sites.google.com/view/goalconditioned-rl/)).

- Another important challenge is to deal with stochastic environments. The current version of TRL assumes deterministic dynamics, but many real-world environments are stochastic, mainly due to partial observability. For this, [“stochastic” triangle inequalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098) might provide some hints.

- Practically, I think there is still a lot of room to further improve TRL. For example, we can find better ways to choose subgoal candidates (beyond the ones from the same trajectory), further reduce hyperparameters, further stabilize training, and simplify the algorithm even more.


In general, I’m really excited about the potential of the divide-and-conquer paradigm. I [still](https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/) think one of the most important problems in RL (and even in machine learning) is to find a _scalable_ off-policy RL algorithm. I don’t know what the final solution will look like, but I do think divide and conquer, or **recursive** decision-making in general, is one of the strongest candidates toward this holy grail (by the way, I think the other strong contenders are (1) model-based RL and (2) TD learning with some “magic” tricks). Indeed, several recent works in other fields have shown the promise of recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies, such as [shortcut models](https://kvfrans.com/shortcut-models/), [log-linear attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04761), and [recursive language models](https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/) (and of course, classic algorithms like quicksort, segment trees, FFT, and so on). I hope to see more exciting progress in scalable off-policy RL in the near future!

The [Arduino Uno Q](https://www.arduino.cc/product-uno-q) is... a weird board. It&#39;s the first product born out of [Qualcomm&#39;s buyout of Arduino](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/qualcomms-buying-arduino-–-what-it-means-makers).

Arduino even tried it before with their old [Yún](https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/boards/arduino-yun/) board, which had Linux running on a MIPS CPU, married to an ATmega microcontroller.

      <title>CoreWeave adds Marimo to their 2025 acquisition spree</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/31/coreweave-acquires-marimo/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://marimo.io/blog/joining-coreweave">Marimo is Joining CoreWeave</a></strong></p>
        I don't usually cover startup acquisitions here, but this one feels relevant to several of my interests.</p>
        <p>Marimo (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/marimo/">previously</a>) provide an open source (Apache 2 licensed) notebook tool for Python, with first-class support for an additional WebAssembly build plus an optional hosted service. It's effectively a reimagining of Jupyter notebooks as a reactive system, where cells automatically update based on changes to other cells - similar to how <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> JavaScript notebooks work.</p>
        <p>The first public Marimo release was in January 2024 and the tool has "been in development since 2022" (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44304607#44330375">source</a>).</p>
        <p>CoreWeave are a <em>big</em> player in the AI data center space. They started out as an Ethereum mining company in 2017, then pivoted to cloud computing infrastructure for AI companies after the 2018 cryptocurrency crash. They IPOd in March 2025 and today they operate more than 30 data centers worldwide and have announced a number of eye-wateringly sized deals with companies such as Cohere and OpenAI. I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreWeave">their Wikipedia page</a> very helpful.</p>
        <p>They've also been on an acquisition spree this year, including:</p>

      <source:markdown>**[Marimo is Joining CoreWeave](https://marimo.io/blog/joining-coreweave)**

I don&#39;t usually cover startup acquisitions here, but this one feels relevant to several of my interests.

Marimo ( [previously](https://simonwillison.net/tags/marimo/)) provide an open source (Apache 2 licensed) notebook tool for Python, with first-class support for an additional WebAssembly build plus an optional hosted service. It&#39;s effectively a reimagining of Jupyter notebooks as a reactive system, where cells automatically update based on changes to other cells - similar to how [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) JavaScript notebooks work.

The first public Marimo release was in January 2024 and the tool has &#34;been in development since 2022&#34; ( [source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44304607#44330375)).

CoreWeave are a _big_ player in the AI data center space. They started out as an Ethereum mining company in 2017, then pivoted to cloud computing infrastructure for AI companies after the 2018 cryptocurrency crash. They IPOd in March 2025 and today they operate more than 30 data centers worldwide and have announced a number of eye-wateringly sized deals with companies such as Cohere and OpenAI. I found [their Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreWeave) very helpful.

They&#39;ve also been on an acquisition spree this year, including:

- Weights &#38; Biases [in March 2025](https://www.coreweave.com/blog/coreweave-completes-acquisition-of-weights-biases) (deal closed in May), the AI training observability platform.
- OpenPipe [in September 2025](https://www.coreweave.com/news/coreweave-to-acquire-openpipe-leader-in-reinforcement-learning) \- a reinforcement learning platform, authors of the [Agent Reinforcement Trainer](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART) Apache 2 licensed open source RL framework.
- Monolith AI [in October 2025](https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-to-Acquire-Monolith-Expanding-AI-Cloud-Platform-into-Industrial-Innovation/default.aspx), a UK-based AI model SaaS platform focused on AI for engineering and industrial manufacturing.
- And now Marimo.

Marimo&#39;s own announcement emphasizes continued investment in that tool:

&#62; Marimo is joining CoreWeave. We’re continuing to build the open-source marimo notebook, while also leveling up molab with serious compute. Our long-term mission remains the same: to build the world’s best open-source programming environment for working with data.
&#62;
&#62; marimo is, and always will be, free, open-source, and permissively licensed.

Give CoreWeave&#39;s buying spree only really started this year it&#39;s impossible to say how well these acquisitions are likely to play out - they haven&#39;t yet established a track record.

### What’s the big idea?

There was a serious performance problem, that, with the help of [Ryan Neudorf](https://ohryan.ca/author/admin/) who I met in Ottawa, and Scott Hanson, longtime contributor here, was [fixed](https://github.com/scripting/feedlandDev/issues/8). It was a daring move, it meant that _all_ the timeline-generating code in FeedLand had to be rewritten. It was worth it. If you&#39;ve ever felt that FeedLand was too slow at displaying news, please try again, I think you&#39;ll be pleased.</source:markdown>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h3><em>For October 22-28, 2025</em></h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Hey guys, James here. Please don’t tell Luke, but for the fourth year in a row I’ve eaten all the Halloween candy that we’re supposed to hand out at Humorous Readings Headquarters (HRHQ). I’m not sure he’s going to buy “it all melted and was sipped up by hummingbirds” again, so if he asks, just back me up and say that you don’t know what happened to the candy or why my face is smeared in chocolate. Thanks!</p>

It’s so specifically weird and stilted in a way that immediately conjures a character.</p>

      <source:markdown>### _For October 22-28, 2025_

Hello and welcome to **A Newsletter of Humorous Writing**, a roundup of the week&#39;s finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Hey guys, James here. Please don’t tell Luke, but for the fourth year in a row I’ve eaten all the Halloween candy that we’re supposed to hand out at Humorous Readings Headquarters (HRHQ). I’m not sure he’s going to buy “it all melted and was sipped up by hummingbirds” again, so if he asks, just back me up and say that you don’t know what happened to the candy or why my face is smeared in chocolate. Thanks!

## What We Enjoyed This Week

[**Healthy! This Woman Just Chose Chips Over Gummy Worms Because They Seem More of the Earth**](https://reductress.com/post/healthy-this-woman-just-chose-chips-over-gummy-worms-because-they-seem-more-of-the-earth/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-416) **by** [**McKayley Gourley**](https://www.mckayleygourley.com/about?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-416) _(Reductress)_ This piece, written by one of our favorite writers, is filled with great lines but we want to zoom in on a very small detail: the closing phrase in the title, “They Seem More of the Earth” is excellent. It’s so specifically weird and stilted in a way that immediately conjures a character.

[**New Rules For The Moat**](https://medium.com/slackjaw/new-rules-for-the-moat-4b61cc9edc69?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-416) **by** [**Luís Leal Miranda**](https://livrariaplutao.bigcartel.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-416) _(Slackjaw)_ Very impressive breadth of exploration here. Luís hits moats from a lot of angles, which is a good reminder to really take the time to think through all the implications of your premise. It pays off!

[**Our Wedding Gifts: Ten Years Later**](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/our-wedding-gifts-ten-years-later?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-416) **by** [**Kristen Mulrooney**](https://kristenmulrooney.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-416) _(McSweeney’s)_ Such a simple, clear pattern to this piece. Kristen has so much fun exploring and sticks the landing with a perfect final beat that caps off a bunch of threads in one go. We also love a zoodles reference.

It’s a chance for actors to sharpen their comedic craft or comedians to deepen their acting. The goal: treat comedy with the same artistic rigor as drama.

        <p>My auto-blocking of bots hasn’t needed much intervention in recent weeks. The
        current average is 10,000 blocked IP ranges.
        If you&rsquo;re interested, there&rsquo;s a

        <p>Hah, I post the above and now load is 95 and the bots are at it.</p>
        
        <p>What I don’t like about Munin is that when it crashes (I assume it’s the OOM
        reaper making the rounds), then it leaves behind a lock that prevents the
        graph from updating. Ugh.</p>

        <p>If you like large language models (LLMs), know that they need regular
        training and the people training them are ruining the web for
        everybody. You are part of this, as a consumer.</p>
        
        <p>Most sites don’t have the defences required, or require the execution
        of expensive JavaScript for the CO₂ god, or require placing all your
        visitor’s browsing data into the hands of another company, most likely
        CloudFlare, in the USA. If you object to any of that, you must do your
        duty and reject the use of LLMs as well. You can’t eat your cake and
        claim to object to the rest. It would be a most incongruent position
        to take.</p>
        
        <p>And since this kind of shit often happens while
        <a href="2025-portugal">I’m on holidays</a>, the LLM friends reading this are
        responsible, in a very small way, for pissing on me during my

        favourite targets of the AI scrapers and thinking of the people who
        like to use large language models.</p>
        
        <p>It’s the same problem as always: drive a car, see the CO₂ in the world

        consequences by time and space like to choose comfort. In this case,
        the AI comfort leads to the shut down of the open web, the
        centralisation of what remains, the installation of barriers, and ever
        and always: more control for fewer people. But of course, the

If you’re interested, there’s a
[a description of my setup](https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index).

![Lots of graphs but the important one is the yellow line that’s pretty stable around 10k.](2025-10-22-bots-again/01K7RMQ3YVE09T7ZYGSNEMBH1H.png)

Hah, I post the above and now load is 95 and the bots are at it.

What I don’t like about Munin is that when it crashes (I assume it’s the OOM
reaper making the rounds), then it leaves behind a lock that prevents the
graph from updating. Ugh.

If you like large language models (LLMs), know that they need regular

And since this kind of shit often happens while
[I’m on holidays](2025-portugal), the LLM friends reading this are
responsible, in a very small way, for pissing on me during my
holidays. And I resent it.

I resent it very much.

![Load going up to 80, again. And back down, again.](2025-10-22-bots-again/01K7YXF66MYSEQC615WGSBECN2.png)

Waking up in a hotel bed, opening the balcony doors, hearing the birds
sing, switching on the phone and realising that load is over 100 and

favourite targets of the AI scrapers and thinking of the people who

Imagine a goddess of destruction with a grim smile and a thousand
hands and each one of them is giving you a middle finger.

Load average: 142.25

I switched off Community Wiki and Emacs Wiki.

Coming back after a day of excursions and things seem to be working
fine, if I don’t switch on those two sites. These two have been
unavailable for a minimum of six hours and yet in the last two hours
Emacs Wiki still got 3537 requests.

Time to ban every network of every ASN that’s still requesting Emacs Wiki pages.

```
2h-access-log \
| grep &#39;^www\.emacswiki\.org&#39; \
| log-ip \
| asncounter --top 50 --no-prefixes 2&#62;/dev/null \

| xargs asn-networks \
| xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad-week banip

```

If you’re looking for the building blocks I’m using, see my
[collection of admin scripts and shell functions](https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/).

Hours later, I switched Emacs Wiki on for a minute and load
immediately rose from around 1 to nearly 4 and my SSH connection
became slow as molasses. It’ll remain switched off for tonight and
probably tomorrow, too. It depends on the kind of wifi connection I
have, tomorrow.

Perhaps I should just hand Emacs Wiki off to somebody who’s more into
it.

Switching off Community Wiki and two smaller sites as well, for now.

&#62; **Aisuru**, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic. Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users. – [Aisuru Botnet Shifts from DDoS to Residential Proxies](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/)

&#62; The public internet is mostly bots, many of whom are bad netizens. It’s the most hostile it’s ever been, and it is because of this that I feel it’s more important than ever to take good care of the spaces that make the internet worth visiting. – [Aggressive bots ruined my weekend](https://herman.bearblog.dev/agressive-bots/)</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown># GHC 9.14.1-rc1 is now available

#### bgamari - 2025-10-30

The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
release candidate of GHC 9.14.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at [downloads.haskell.org](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-rc1).

GHC 9.14 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:

- Significant improvements in specialisation:

  - The `SPECIALISE` pragma now allows use of type application syntax
  - The `SPECIALISE` pragma can be used to specialise for expression arguments
    as well as type arguments.
  - Specialisation is now considerably more reliable in the presence of
    `newtype` s
- Significant GHCi improvements including:

  - Correctness and performance improvements in the bytecode interpreter
  - Features in the GHCi debugger
  - Support for multiple home units in GHCi
- Implementation of the [Explicit Level Imports proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0682-explicit-level-imports.rst)

- `RequiredTypeArguments` can now be used in more contexts

- SSE/AVX2 support in the x86 native code generator backend

- A major update of the Windows toolchain and improved compatibility with
  macOS Tahoe

- … and many more


A full accounting of changes can be found in the [release notes](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-rc1/docs/users_guide/9.14.1-notes.html). Given the
many specialisation improvements and their potential for regression, we would
very much appreciate testing and performance characterisation on downstream
workloads.

Note that while this release makes many improvements in the specialisation
optimisation, polymorphic specialisation will remain disabled by default in the
final release due to concern over regressions of the sort identified in
[#26329](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26329). Users needing more aggressive specialisation can explicitly
enable this feature with the `-fpolymorphic-specialisation` flag. Depending
upon our experience with 9.14.1, we may enable this feature by default in a
later minor release.

This is the first and hopefully last release candidate prerelease of 9.14.1.
This comes later than expected in part due to work on resolving a regression
in macOS 26 ( [#26166](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/26166)) which threatened the usability of the
release. This prerelease includes a fix to this regression; naturally, please
open a ticket if you encounter any trouble when using this release on macOS
Tahoe or recent XCode releases. We expect that this fix will be backported to GHC
9.12 and 9.10 in the coming months.

We would like to thank the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed, Mercury, Channable,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and other anonymous
contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind support has facilitated GHC
maintenance and release management over the years. Finally, this release would
not have been possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose
work have made the Haskell ecosystem what it is today.

As always, do give this release a try and open a [ticket](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/homepage/-/issues/new) if you see
anything amiss.</source:markdown>

        <p>It's a very promising model.

        <p>The model’s strengths include tool use and instruction following (as shown by Tau2 Bench and IFBench). As such, while M2 likely excels at agentic use cases it may underperform other open weights leaders such as DeepSeek V3.2 and Qwen3 235B at some generalist tasks. This is in line with a number of recent open weights model releases from Chinese AI labs which focus on agentic capabilities, likely pointing to a heavy post-training emphasis on RL.</p>

MiniMax M2 was released on Monday 27th October by MiniMax, a Chinese AI lab founded in December 2021.

It&#39;s a very promising model. Their self-reported benchmark scores show it as comparable to Claude Sonnet 4, and Artificial Analysis [are ranking it](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1982714153375854998) as the best currently available open weight model according to their intelligence score:

&#62; MiniMax’s M2 achieves a new all-time-high Intelligence Index score for an open weights model and offers impressive efficiency with only 10B active parameters (200B total). \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; The model’s strengths include tool use and instruction following (as shown by Tau2 Bench and IFBench). As such, while M2 likely excels at agentic use cases it may underperform other open weights leaders such as DeepSeek V3.2 and Qwen3 235B at some generalist tasks. This is in line with a number of recent open weights model releases from Chinese AI labs which focus on agentic capabilities, likely pointing to a heavy post-training emphasis on RL.

The size is particularly significant: the model weights are 230GB [on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2), significantly smaller than other high performing open weight models. That&#39;s small enough to run on a 256GB Mac Studio, and the MLX community [have that working already](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/MiniMax-M2-8bit).

MiniMax offer their own API, and recommend using their Anthropic-compatible endpoint and the official Anthropic SDKs to access it. MiniMax Head of Engineering Skyler Miao
[provided some background on that](https://x.com/SkylerMiao7/status/1982989507252367687):

&#62; M2 is a agentic thinking model, it do interleaved thinking like sonnet 4.5, which means every response will contain its thought content.
&#62; Its very important for M2 to keep the chain of thought. So we must make sure the history thought passed back to the model.

I released a new plugin for [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/) called [llm-minimax](https://github.com/simonw/llm-minimax) providing support for M2 via the MiniMax API:

51 input, 4,017 output. At $0.30/m input and $1.20/m output that pelican would cost 0.4836 cents - less than half a cent.

This is the first plugin I&#39;ve written for an Anthropic-API-compatible model. I released [llm-anthropic 0.21](https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.21) first adding the ability to customize the `base_url` parameter when using that model class. This meant the new plugin was less than [30 lines of Python](https://github.com/simonw/llm-minimax/blob/0.1/llm_minimax.py).

      <source:markdown>**[Composer: Building a fast frontier model with RL](https://cursor.com/blog/composer)**

Cursor released [Cursor 2.0 today](https://cursor.com/blog/2-0), with a refreshed UI focused on agentic coding (and running agents in parallel) and a new model that&#39;s unique to Cursor called **Composer 1**.

As far as I can tell there&#39;s no way to call the model directly via an API, so I fired up &#34;Ask&#34; mode in Cursor&#39;s chat side panel and asked it to &#34;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&#34;:

![Screenshot of Cursor 2 - In the chat panel I have asked the question and it spat out a bunch of SVG.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cursor-2.jpg)

![The bicycle is levitating against a blue sky. The pelican looks a little bit more like a baby chicken but does at least have a long beak.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cursor-1-pelican.png)

The notable thing about Composer-1 is that it is designed to be _fast_. The pelican certainly came back quickly, and in their announcement they describe it as being &#34;4x faster than similarly intelligent models&#34;.

It&#39;s interesting to see Cursor investing resources in training their own code-specific model - similar to [GPT-5-Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-upgrades-to-codex/) or [Qwen3-Coder](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder). From their post:

How much better our lives would be if we focused on the good, generous and creative people among us who have made our lives better? </p>
        <p>I would honor people I love because they project strength and empathy, for me that would be AOC who I'd love to have as a niece or sister, or aunt, and no doubt she'd make a great mom. I don't like Schumer because he's sad and stupid. We need someone in that role who's more like JFK or even LBJ. Confident bordering on arrogance. Someone with the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=gravitas">gravitas</a> Schumer doesn't project. </p>
        <p>I would give an award to <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Philippe%20Kahn%22">Philippe Kahn</a> for practical brilliance. I've learned from everyone I've competed with, and he had a practical philosophy about software I had never seen before. A feature that he saw that made the product more brilliant. They weren't huge things, but they showed he was thinking about the user. Not surprising that a few years after our competiton between Sidekick and Ready he went on to prove that a mobile phone would make a great camera. He not only thought of it, he made it work. That's the kind of spirit I admire. </p>
        <p>I was on panels with him a few times, he always had funny things to say, irreverant, sarcastic, but one time he let Bill Gates have it (he was in the room) and called him out for "hogging the fast lane" -- and even though I don't remember what the issue was, I do remember that I knew he was totally right. </p>
        <p>He's very much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Kahn">alive</a> as far as I know.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>It’s been a year since October 2024, when I released <a href="/2024/10/08/bender-2-bend-harder-for-playdate/">my last game on the Playdate Catalog</a>. Over the course of that month, I became increasingly concerned about an undercurrent of threatening and antisocial behaviour from one particular developer in the community—my frequent reports of which went unanswered. Eventually—exactly a year ago today—that tension surfaced as a campaign of targeted harassment. I was assured something would be done about it, but sadly, nothing ever was.</p>
        
        <p><a href="/2025/04/15/when-playdate-stopped-being-fun/">So I left the Playdate community</a>. Over the following months, I faced various forms of harassment: doxxing, unsavoury DMs, spam campaigns targeting my email, cell phone, and social media accounts, unfounded accusations—the list goes on. I can tell you, <em>this is not my idea of a fun time.</em></p>
        
        <p>You might think that after a year this would be old news. Sadly, it’s not. I’ve long since moved on with my life and kept creating—for platforms as exotic as the <a href="/2025/01/05/dream-ride-for-sega-dreamcast-and-emulators/">Sega Dreamcast</a> and as familiar as <a href="/2025/08/21/wormhole-for-perplexity-comet/">the web</a>. I’m proud of what I’ve achieved, and of the choices that allow me to keep doing what I do best, regardless of the people who try to put barriers in my way.</p>
        
        <p>While I continued creating <a href="/2025/05/09/atari-jeff-minter-game-results-jam-llamasoft-and-st-format/">award-winning games</a>, the chance to build the game of my dreams came along—made easier by being an employee at a company that would handle funding, marketing, and the practicalities, freeing me to focus on doing my best work. It was a decision I didn’t take lightly, both because of potential ethical concerns and the fear of further harassment. I sought advice from close friends and had thoughtful discussions with several of them. One friend in particular told me they hadn’t heard of the company, so we didn’t discuss it further. That was back in May.</p>
        
        <p>I announced my first work with the company in July—again, this friend said nothing. Then, in mid-October, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattsephton_super-happy-to-share-that-ive-joined-perplexity-activity-7384626318224617472-ZQJ-">I announced my new permanent position</a>, and that same friend suddenly went off the deep end. I asked what had changed since May, when they hadn’t heard of the company, and why nothing was said in July, when I first went public with my new work—yet now, in October, they were suddenly so angry. Their reply:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>“One of my friends saw your post and sent it to me saying ‘oh no,’ which is how I found out. And then another friend (who you also know) also said ‘oh nooooooo.’”</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>So, essentially, this friend had been incited into anger by others—the same social dynamic that fuelled the harassment a year ago. And the worst part? Those two mutual friends are key figures in the Playdate scene—the very people who once promised to address the harassment are now perpetuating it, a year on. I need to find a stronger word than <em>disappointing</em>, but that will have to do for now.</p>
        
        <p>At this point, I’m letting things run their course and will continue to do what I do best: make games. I’m looking forward to you being able to play the next one.</p>
        
        <p><em>Plus ça change—the more things change, the more they stay the same.</em></p>
        
        <p>Have fun,<br />

      <source:markdown>It’s been a year since October 2024, when I released [my last game on the Playdate Catalog](/2024/10/08/bender-2-bend-harder-for-playdate/).

I need to find a stronger word than _disappointing_, but that will have to do for now.

At this point, I’m letting things run their course and will continue to do what I do best: make games. I’m looking forward to you being able to play the next one.

_Plus ça change—the more things change, the more they stay the same._

Have fun,

      <source:markdown>A very, very deep dive into like-for-like comparison of JavaScript frameworks. The takeaway:

&#62; Nuxt demonstrates that established “big three” frameworks can achieve next-gen performance when properly configured. Vue’s architecture allows competitive mobile web performance while maintaining a mature ecosystem. React and Angular show no path to similar results.

And the _real_ takeaway:

&#62; **Mobile is the web**. These measurements matter because mobile web is the primary internet for billions of people. If your app is accessible via URL, people will use it on phones with cellular connections. Optimizing for desktop and hoping mobile is good enough is backwards. The web is mobile.

      <title>Hacking the WiFi-enabled color screen GitHub Universe conference badge</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/28/github-universe-badge/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I'm at <a href="https://githubuniverse.com/">GitHub Universe</a> this week (thanks to a free ticket from Microsoft). Yesterday I picked up my conference badge... which incorporates a <s>full Raspberry Pi</s> Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller with a battery, color screen, WiFi and bluetooth.</p>
        <p>GitHub Universe has a tradition of hackable conference badges - the badge last year had an eInk display. This year's is a huge upgrade though - a color screen and WiFI connection makes this thing a genuinely useful little computer!</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gitub-universe-badge.jpg" alt="Photo of the badge - it has a color screen with six app icons" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>The only thing it's missing is a keyboard - the device instead provides five buttons total - Up, Down, A, B, C. It might be possible to get a bluetooth keyboard to work though I'll believe that when I see it - there's not a lot of space on this device for a keyboard driver.</p>
        <p>Everything is written using MicroPython, and the device is designed to be hackable: connect it to a laptop with a USB-C cable and you can start modifying the code directly on the device.</p>
        <h4 id="getting-setup-with-the-badge">Getting setup with the badge</h4>
        <p>Out of the box the badge will play an opening animation (implemented as a sequence of PNG image frames) and then show a home screen with six app icons.</p>
        <p>The default apps are mostly neat Octocat-themed demos: a flappy-bird clone, a tamagotchi-style pet, a drawing app that works like an etch-a-sketch, an IR scavenger hunt for the conference venue itself (this thing has an IR sensor too!), and a gallery app showing some images.</p>
        <p>The sixth app is a badge app. This will show your GitHub profile image and some basic stats, but will only work if you dig out a USB-C cable and make some edits to the files on the badge directly.</p>
        <p>I did this on a Mac. I plugged a USB-C cable into the badge which caused MacOS to treat it as an attached drive volume. In that drive are several files including <code>secrets.py</code>. Open that up, confirm the WiFi details are correct and add your GitHub username. The file should look like this:</p>
        <pre><span class="pl-c1">WIFI_SSID</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"..."</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">WIFI_PASSWORD</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"..."</span>
        <span class="pl-c1">GITHUB_USERNAME</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"simonw"</span></pre>
        <p>The badge comes with the SSID and password for the GitHub Universe WiFi network pre-populated.</p>
        <p>That's it! Unmount the disk, hit the reboot button on the back of the badge and when it comes back up again the badge app should look something like this:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-profile.jpg" alt="Badge shows my GitHub avatar, plus 10,947 followers, 4,083 contribs, 893 repos" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <h4 id="building-your-own-apps">Building your own apps</h4>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://badger.github.io/">the official documentation</a> for building software for the badge.</p>
        <p>When I got mine yesterday the official repo had not yet been updated, so I had to figure this out myself.</p>
        <p>I copied all of the code across to my laptop, added it to a Git repo and then fired up Claude Code and told it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Investigate this code and add a detailed README</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/15773c7a53275e7836216c3aa9a8a781c06f7859/README.md">the result</a>, which was really useful for getting a start on understanding how it all worked.</p>
        <p>Each of the six default apps lives in a <code>apps/</code> folder, for example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/sketch">apps/sketch/</a> for the sketching app.</p>
        <p>There's also a menu app which powers the home screen. That lives in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/menu">apps/menu/</a>. You can edit code in here to add new apps that you create to that screen.</p>
        <p>I told Claude:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Add a new app to it available from the menu which shows network status and other useful debug info about the machine it is running on</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This was a bit of a long-shot, but it totally worked!</p>
        <p>The first version had an error:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-error.jpg" alt="A stacktrace! file badgeware.py line 510 has a list index out of range error." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>I OCRd that photo (with the Apple Photos app) and pasted the message into Claude Code and it fixed the problem.</p>
        <p>This almost worked... but the addition of a seventh icon to the 2x3 grid meant that you could select the icon but it didn't scroll into view. I had Claude <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/commit/2a60f75db101dc1dc7568ff466ad5c97dc86b336">fix that for me too</a>.</p>
        <p>Here's the code for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/main/apps/debug/__init__.py">apps/debug/__init__.py</a>, and <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?276d3e0c6566ddbc93adc7020ef6b439">the full Claude Code transcript</a> created using my terminal-to-HTML app <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/">described here</a>.</p>
        <p>Here are the four screens of the debug app:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-network.jpg" alt="Network info, showing WiFi network details and IP address" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-storage.jpg" alt="Storage screen, it has 1MB total, 72BK used. Usage 7%. CMD is /system/apps/debug" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-system.jpg" alt="System: Platform rp2, Python 1.26.0, CPU freq 200MHz, Uptime 13m46s" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-memory.jpg" alt="Memory info - 100KB used, 241KB total, and a usage bar. Press B to run GC." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <h4 id="an-icon-editor">An icon editor</h4>
        <p>The icons used on the app are 24x24 pixels. I decided it would be neat to have a web app that helps build those icons, including the ability to start by creating an icon from an emoji.</p>
        <p>I bulit this one <a href="https://claude.ai/share/ca05bd58-859e-4ceb-b5c7-7428b348df3c">using Claude Artifacts</a>. Here's the result, now available at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor">tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor</a>:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/icon-editor.jpg" alt="A stacktrace! file badgeware.py line 510 has a list index out of range error." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <h4 id="and-a-repl">And a REPL</h4>
        <p>I noticed that last year's badge configuration app (which I can't find in <a href="https://github.com/badger/badger.github.io/">github.com/badger/badger.github.io</a> any more, I think they reset the history on that repo?) worked by talking to MicroPython over the Web Serial API from Chrome. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/2004-badger.github.io/blob/e3501d631a987bfbc12d93c9e35bf2c64e55d052/public/script.js#L305-L394">my archived copy of that code</a>.</p>
        <p>Wouldn't it be useful to have a REPL in a web UI that you could use to interact with the badge directly over USB?</p>
        <p>I pointed Claude Code at a copy of that repo and told it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Based on this build a new HTML with inline JavaScript page that uses WebUSB to simply test that the connection to the badge works and then list files on that device using the same mechanism</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It took a bit of poking (here's <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?13d93a9e3b0ce1c921cd20303f2f1d84">the transcript</a>) but the result is now live at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl">tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl</a>. It only works in Chrome - you'll need to plug the badge in with a USB-C cable and then click "Connect to Badge".</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>I&#39;m at [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) this week (thanks to a free ticket from Microsoft). Yesterday I picked up my conference badge... which incorporates a full Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller with a battery, color screen, WiFi and bluetooth.

GitHub Universe has a tradition of hackable conference badges - the badge last year had an eInk display. This year&#39;s is a huge upgrade though - a color screen and WiFI connection makes this thing a genuinely useful little computer!

![Photo of the badge - it has a color screen with six app icons](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gitub-universe-badge.jpg)

The only thing it&#39;s missing is a keyboard - the device instead provides five buttons total - Up, Down, A, B, C. It might be possible to get a bluetooth keyboard to work though I&#39;ll believe that when I see it - there&#39;s not a lot of space on this device for a keyboard driver.

Everything is written using MicroPython, and the device is designed to be hackable: connect it to a laptop with a USB-C cable and you can start modifying the code directly on the device.

#### Getting setup with the badge

Out of the box the badge will play an opening animation (implemented as a sequence of PNG image frames) and then show a home screen with six app icons.

The default apps are mostly neat Octocat-themed demos: a flappy-bird clone, a tamagotchi-style pet, a drawing app that works like an etch-a-sketch, an IR scavenger hunt for the conference venue itself (this thing has an IR sensor too!), and a gallery app showing some images.

The sixth app is a badge app. This will show your GitHub profile image and some basic stats, but will only work if you dig out a USB-C cable and make some edits to the files on the badge directly.

I did this on a Mac. I plugged a USB-C cable into the badge which caused MacOS to treat it as an attached drive volume. In that drive are several files including `secrets.py`. Open that up, confirm the WiFi details are correct and add your GitHub username. The file should look like this:

```
WIFI_SSID = &#34;...&#34;
WIFI_PASSWORD = &#34;...&#34;
GITHUB_USERNAME = &#34;simonw&#34;
```

The badge comes with the SSID and password for the GitHub Universe WiFi network pre-populated.

That&#39;s it! Unmount the disk, hit the reboot button on the back of the badge and when it comes back up again the badge app should look something like this:

![Badge shows my GitHub avatar, plus 10,947 followers, 4,083 contribs, 893 repos](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-profile.jpg)

#### Building your own apps

Here&#39;s [the official documentation](https://badger.github.io/) for building software for the badge.

When I got mine yesterday the official repo had not yet been updated, so I had to figure this out myself.

I copied all of the code across to my laptop, added it to a Git repo and then fired up Claude Code and told it:

&#62; `Investigate this code and add a detailed README`

Here&#39;s [the result](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/15773c7a53275e7836216c3aa9a8a781c06f7859/README.md), which was really useful for getting a start on understanding how it all worked.

Each of the six default apps lives in a `apps/` folder, for example [apps/sketch/](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/sketch) for the sketching app.

There&#39;s also a menu app which powers the home screen. That lives in [apps/menu/](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/menu). You can edit code in here to add new apps that you create to that screen.

I told Claude:

&#62; `Add a new app to it available from the menu which shows network status and other useful debug info about the machine it is running on`

This was a bit of a long-shot, but it totally worked!

The first version had an error:

![A stacktrace! file badgeware.py line 510 has a list index out of range error.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-error.jpg)

I OCRd that photo (with the Apple Photos app) and pasted the message into Claude Code and it fixed the problem.

This almost worked... but the addition of a seventh icon to the 2x3 grid meant that you could select the icon but it didn&#39;t scroll into view. I had Claude [fix that for me too](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/commit/2a60f75db101dc1dc7568ff466ad5c97dc86b336).

Here&#39;s the code for [apps/debug/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/main/apps/debug/__init__.py), and [the full Claude Code transcript](https://gistpreview.github.io/?276d3e0c6566ddbc93adc7020ef6b439) created using my terminal-to-HTML app [described here](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/).

Here are the four screens of the debug app:

![Network info, showing WiFi network details and IP address](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-network.jpg)

![Storage screen, it has 1MB total, 72BK used. Usage 7%. CMD is /system/apps/debug](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-storage.jpg)

![System: Platform rp2, Python 1.26.0, CPU freq 200MHz, Uptime 13m46s](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-system.jpg)

![Memory info - 100KB used, 241KB total, and a usage bar. Press B to run GC.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-memory.jpg)

#### An icon editor

The icons used on the app are 24x24 pixels. I decided it would be neat to have a web app that helps build those icons, including the ability to start by creating an icon from an emoji.

I bulit this one [using Claude Artifacts](https://claude.ai/share/ca05bd58-859e-4ceb-b5c7-7428b348df3c). Here&#39;s the result, now available at [tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor](https://tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor):

![A stacktrace! file badgeware.py line 510 has a list index out of range error.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/icon-editor.jpg)

#### And a REPL

I noticed that last year&#39;s badge configuration app (which I can&#39;t find in [github.com/badger/badger.github.io](https://github.com/badger/badger.github.io/) any more, I think they reset the history on that repo?) worked by talking to MicroPython over the Web Serial API from Chrome. Here&#39;s [my archived copy of that code](https://github.com/simonw/2004-badger.github.io/blob/e3501d631a987bfbc12d93c9e35bf2c64e55d052/public/script.js#L305-L394).

Wouldn&#39;t it be useful to have a REPL in a web UI that you could use to interact with the badge directly over USB?

I pointed Claude Code at a copy of that repo and told it:

&#62; `Based on this build a new HTML with inline JavaScript page that uses WebUSB to simply test that the connection to the badge works and then list files on that device using the same mechanism`

It took a bit of poking (here&#39;s [the transcript](https://gistpreview.github.io/?13d93a9e3b0ce1c921cd20303f2f1d84)) but the result is now live at [tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl](https://tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl). It only works in Chrome - you&#39;ll need to plug the badge in with a USB-C cable and then click &#34;Connect to Badge&#34;.

![Badge Interactive REPL. Note: This tool requires the Web Serial API (Chrome/Edge on desktop). Connect to Badge, Disconnect and Clear Terminal buttons. Then a REPL interface displaying: Ready to connect. Click &#34;Connect to Badge&#34; to start.Traceback (most recent call last):ddae88e91.dirty on 2025-10-20; GitHub Badger with RP2350 Type &#34;help()&#34; for more information.  &#62;&#62;&#62;  MicroPython v1.14-5485.gddae88e91.dirty on 2025-10-20; GitHub Badger with RP2350 Type &#34;help()&#34; for more information. &#62;&#62;&#62; os.listdir() [&#39;icon.py&#39;, &#39;ui.py&#39;, &#39;init.py&#39;, &#39;._init.py&#39;, &#39;._icon.py&#39;] &#62;&#62;&#62; machine.freq() 200000000 &#62;&#62;&#62; gc.mem_free() 159696 &#62;&#62;&#62; help() Welcome to MicroPython!](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-repl.jpg)

#### Get hacking

If you&#39;re a GitHub Universe attendee I hope this is useful. The official [badger.github.io](https://badger.github.io/) site has plenty more details to help you get started.

There isn&#39;t yet a way to get hold of this hardware outside of GitHub Universe - I know they had some supply chain challenges just getting enough badges for the conference attendees!

It&#39;s a very neat device, built for GitHub by [Pimoroni](https://www.pimoroni.com/) in Sheffield, UK. A version of this should become generally available in the future under the name &#34;Pimoroni Tufty 2350&#34;.

#### Update: Setup with iPhone only

If you don&#39;t have a laptop with you it&#39;s still possible to start hacking on the device using just a USB-C cable.

Plug the badge into the phone, hit the reset button on the back twice to switch it into disk mode and open the iPhone Files app - the badge should appear as a mounted disk called BADGER.

I used [Textastic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor/id1049254261) to edit that `secrets.py` and configure a new badge, then hit reset again to restart it.

But another part is the monolithic narrative—the fact that we live in a world where there seem to be only a few companies, only a few stories going at any time, and everything reduces to politics. God, please let it end.</source:markdown>

&#62; 1. Atlas substitutes its own AI-generated content for the web, but it looks like it’s showing you the web
&#62; 2. The user experience makes you guess what commands to type instead of clicking on links
&#62; 3. You’re the agent for the browser, it’s not being an agent for you
&#62;
&#62; It’s very clear that a lot of the new AI era is about dismantling the web’s original design.

        For more than a decade Backblaze has been providing an important public service by publishing data on the reliability of their hard drives, and more recently their SSDs. Below the fold I comment on this month's post from their Drive Stats Team, <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/are-hard-drives-getting-better-lets-revisit-the-bathtub-curve/"><i>Are Hard Drives Getting Better?

        Wikipedia defines the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub_curve">Bathtub Curve</a> as a common concept in reliability engineering:<br />
        <blockquote>
        The 'bathtub' refers to the shape of a line that curves up at both ends, similar in shape to a bathtub. The bathtub curve has 3 regions:<br />
        <ol>
        <li>The first region has a decreasing failure rate due to early failures.</li>
        <li>The middle region is a constant failure rate due to random failures.</li>

        </ol>

        In 2017's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/10/storage-failures-in-field.html"><i>Storage Failures In The Field</i></a> I commented on Backblaze's observation that the 10TB and 12TB HDD generations showed much reduced infant mortality:<br />
        <blockquote>
        devoting engineering effort to reducing infant mortality can have a significant return on investment. A drive that fails early will be returned under warranty, costing the company money. A drive that fails after the warranty expires cannot be returned. Warranty costs must be reserved against in the company's accounts. Any reduction in the rate of early failures goes straight to the company's bottom line.
        </blockquote>
        Enterprise disks are typically warranted for 5 years, so a disk manufacturer is incentized to focus engineering effort on eliminating the "first region", the left side of the bathtub, and ensuring that the second region extends past the 5 year mark. Eight years ago Backblaze was starting to see that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/big-hard-disks-may-be-breaking-the-bathtub-curve/">engineers were succeeding in the first region</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        While the data so far is very limited, with 1,240 disks and 14,220 aggregate drive days accumulated so far, none of these disks (both Seagate models) have failed. The low level of usage means that the disks have been installed and formatted and not much beyond that, but true infant mortality—disks that immediately expire on their first use—hasn’t become apparent.

        Four years later in <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/drive-failure-over-time-the-bathtub-curve-is-leaking/"><i>Drive Failure Over Time: The Bathtub Curve Is Leaking</i></a> Klein had some much stronger evidence:<br />
        <blockquote>
        The left side of the bathtub, the area of “decreasing failure rate,” is dramatically lower in 2021 than in 2013. In fact, for our 2021 curve, there is almost no left side of the bathtub, making it hard to take a bath, to say the least. We have reported how <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-to-build-a-hard-drive-a-factory-tour/">Seagate breaks in and tests their newly manufactured hard drives</a> before shipping in an effort to lower the failure rates of their drives. Assuming all manufacturers do the same, that may explain some or all of this observation.
        </blockquote>
        Note that the engineers hadn't quite succeeded in the second region, as the 2021 failure rate for years 4 and 5 was noticeably higher than for younger drives. But they had succeeded in pushing the major increase in failures out beyond 5.5 years. Everything before that was less than 4% Annual Failure Rate (AFR).<br />

        Another four years later in the current graph things have changed quite a bit:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>For the first 5 years the AFR is under 2%.</li>
        <li>For the first 5 years the AFR gradually increases, the first region has been completely eliminated.</li>
        <li>For the three years after a 5-year warranty expires, the AFR is under 3%.</li>
        <li>For the next two years the AFR drops, bottoming out around 1%.
        </li><li>Everything out to 10 years has an AFR under 3%.</li>
        <li>The third region starts with a spike at 10.5 years.</li>
        <li>Even at 10.5 years the AFR is only just over 4%</li>
        </ul>

        Backblaze's final graph puts all three sets of data in one graph and shows a dramatic improvement in drive longevity:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>Drives in 2013 were dramatically less reliable than in later years, both because their AFRs were consistently higher and because their AFR hit 13% after 3 years.</li>
        <li>By 2021 the engineers had kept the AFR around 2% through the warranty, but the drives wore out rapidly in the 7th year.</li>
        <li>Now, the drives are only showing signs of beginning to wear out at 10.5 years.</li>
        </ul>
        That is some serious engineering at the long end! And at the short end <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/are-hard-drives-getting-better-lets-revisit-the-bathtub-curve/">things are great</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        we see that the drive failure rates on the front end of the curve are also incredibly low—when a drive is between zero and one years old, we barely crack 1.30% AFR.
        </blockquote>
        The left side of the bathtub is really gone, improving the manufacturers' margins. But if I eyeball the 2025 graph's first 20 quarters I estimate the AFR averages 1.6%, which implies that over the 5-year warranty 8% of the drives failed. Clearly, the engineers still have work to do.<br />
        <br />
        Remember to check back in 2029 when Backblaze plans to return to this issue.<br />]]>

Another four years later in the current graph things have changed quite a bit:

- For the first 5 years the AFR is under 2%.
- For the first 5 years the AFR gradually increases, the first region has been completely eliminated.
- For the three years after a 5-year warranty expires, the AFR is under 3%.
- For the next two years the AFR drops, bottoming out around 1%.

- Everything out to 10 years has an AFR under 3%.
- The third region starts with a spike at 10.5 years.
- Even at 10.5 years the AFR is only just over 4%

Backblaze&#39;s final graph puts all three sets of data in one graph and shows a dramatic improvement in drive longevity:

- Drives in 2013 were dramatically less reliable than in later years, both because their AFRs were consistently higher and because their AFR hit 13% after 3 years.
- By 2021 the engineers had kept the AFR around 2% through the warranty, but the drives wore out rapidly in the 7th year.
- Now, the drives are only showing signs of beginning to wear out at 10.5 years.

That is some serious engineering at the long end! And at the short end [things are great](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/are-hard-drives-getting-better-lets-revisit-the-bathtub-curve/):

&#62; we see that the drive failure rates on the front end of the curve are also incredibly low—when a drive is between zero and one years old, we barely crack 1.30% AFR.

The left side of the bathtub is really gone, improving the manufacturers&#39; margins. But if I eyeball the 2025 graph&#39;s first 20 quarters I estimate the AFR averages 1.6%, which implies that over the 5-year warranty 8% of the drives failed. Clearly, the engineers still have work to do.

Remember to check back in 2029 when Backblaze plans to return to this issue.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>**[The PSF has withdrawn a $1.5 million proposal to US government grant program](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html)**

The Python Software Foundation was recently &#34;recommended for funding&#34; (NSF terminology) for a $1.5m grant from the US government National Science Foundation to help improve the security of the Python software ecosystem, after an grant application process lead by Seth Larson and Loren Crary.

The PSF&#39;s annual budget is less than $6m so this is a meaningful amount of money for the organization!

We were forced to withdraw our application and turn down the funding, thanks to new language that was added to the agreement requiring us to affirm that we &#34;do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.&#34;

Our legal advisors confirmed that this would not just apply to security work covered by the grant - this would apply to all of the PSF&#39;s activities.

This was not an option for us. Here&#39;s the [mission](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/) of the PSF:

&#62; The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

If we accepted and spent the money despite this term, there was a very real risk that the money could be clawed back later. That represents an existential risk for the foundation since we would have already spent the money!

I was one of the board members who voted to reject this funding - a unanimous but tough decision. I’m proud to serve on a board that can make difficult decisions like this.

If you&#39;d like to sponsor the PSF you can find out more [on our site](https://www.python.org/sponsors/application/). I&#39;d love to see a few more of the large AI labs show up [on our top-tier visionary sponsors list](https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/).

        <![CDATA[<h1 id="portugal-2025">Portugal 2025</h1>
        
        <p>We spent three weeks in Portugal.</p>
        
        <p>I thought October was great since the main season ends mid September.
        But there are still a lot of people in the Lisbon region!</p>
        
        <p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Portugal">#Portugal</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Pictures">#Pictures</a></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-04</strong>. The first day we went for a walk from Estoril to
        Cascais with my stepmom and her sister.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XARZJWQCH73Y5HMDWBT9BX.jpeg" alt="Me, my stepmom, my wife, and my stepmom’s sister, all with sunglasses and grinning into the camera, with the bright sky and the blue ocean in our back." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-04</strong>. The second day we went to Ericeira with my mom and two
        of her friends, watching the ocean and then going to eat seafood. Very
        nice.</p>
        
        <video src="2025-portugal/01K6XANNZXC6XX39NC8C6A6DXA.mp4" poster="/wiki/2025-portugal/01K6XANNZXC6XX39NC8C6A6DXA.jpeg" alt="Waves are crashing into the rocky shore. At the bottom right there are some plastic chairs where older locals are plying cards." preload="none" controls muted></video>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XAS0D7MHFTF4CWX6S3RZK5.jpeg" alt="The beach of Ericeira, protected by a long arm of rock and concrete, with a beach that’s very empty, with fishing boats and boxes and cages all pilled high behind the beach, a 10m cliff (or more) and houses above." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XAS2EG6QDDE7PVJCQ16VET.jpeg" alt="A picture from the foot of the cliff where big chunks have fallen from above and white houses lean precariously close to the edge above." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XAS4S7SQC8P3SWHZX98KGP.jpeg" alt="The view from above where my wife and I are waving, if you zoom in far enough." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-06</strong>. On the third day we went to see Sintra. So many
        people! So many cars. So little parking.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XB7K0TPPGNYBHYJAYPS8A3.jpeg" alt="My wife and my stepmom in front of a wine bar." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XB7N2P769PECS4JD2DW341.jpeg" alt="Looking at a forested hill with a castle wall at the top." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XB7Q0D55W7HVSWYRJZSHH3.jpeg" alt="A few houses and a church from above, with lots of green trees." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K6XB7S1QFFSKM280A7ZM62KJ.jpeg" alt="My wife in the gardens of the old royal summer palace in Sintra, leaning against a wall with geometric ceramic tiles." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-07</strong>. We ended the fourth day at
        <a href="https://www.asevera.com/en/fado-restaurant/">Severa</a>, one of the Fado
        places in Lisbon. I usually go to Clube do Fado but my stepmother
        knows the places to go and Faia had no tables left.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-08</strong>. On the fifth day we went to in Palmela, an old
        fortress town north of Setúbal. The view is great. From now on it&rsquo;s
        just the two of us.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7261CQX4B6SFETX2MMH9WJP.jpeg" alt="Driving over a long bridge. The concrete looks like a big H with “rays” of metal streaming towards us." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7261E4CZKC88SXBZQBN68P8.jpeg" alt="Looking down a dry hill with a winding unpaved road towards a harbour city." /></p>
        
        <p>The region is famous for Muscatel wine. We tasted some and it was great. And
        we had some dried sheep cheese, a very soft cheese from Azeitão, pumpkin jam
        and bread. Super tasty. And we didn’t even have dinner.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K72EGE70C2GZ5HGJKWAVTZ8M.jpeg" alt="The old town and a park and the hill with the old fortress at the top." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K72EGGSXZCXVP6PEGW957D21.jpeg" alt="Cobblestone streets, house facades covered in ceramic tiles, clothes on washing lines out to dry, iron wrought balcony railings. Sadly, also cars." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-09</strong>. We went towards the Cape Espiche and walked to an old
        ruin and back. Perfect weather. This is the area west of Sesimbra in
        the Serra d’Arrábida.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K74Z8YCCCPSCMETHZVVFS8DX.jpeg" alt="A dirt road loading towards the coastline." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K74Z90NE4GC7K5Z9SAGFJGYQ.jpeg" alt="Up here the grass is very dry. Some dry thistles in the foreground." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K74Z93CCNW0TY1BDSD95QEHV.jpeg" alt="The small strip of coast that drops off towards the ocean is green. It looks like a 30 degree angle, and then a steep drop." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K74Z96RAXD5E7V4CKRQW0CYF.jpeg" alt="At the far end, a ruin and the ocean in the sun." /></p>
        
        <p>I had never seen a praying mantis before. This one was moving very
        slowly on the dirt path.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K76MY6D1NGD9JSSVKXWFJDQ3.jpeg" alt="A green insect on red dust, a bit like a grasshopper, but the back legs are very thin and the front legs are huge." /></p>
        
        <p>At the Cabo Espichel there was a closed church and a ruined building
        that looked like a two storey hostel with windows walled shut. It
        looked depressing and I did not take any pictures. I preferred looking
        at the coastline and the sea.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-1.jpg" alt="The steep coastline at Cabo Espichel where the flat land drops into the sea below." /></p>
        
        <p>On the way back we stopped in Sesimbra, had coffee and watched people
        walk by. A perfect way to chill out before returning to the hotel.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-2.jpg" alt="Claudia and I drinking coffee. A galão is usually a morning drink: a glass of milk with a shot of espresso and no milk foam, unlike a latte macchiato." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-10</strong>. Today we drove to Évora and on the way we stopped at
        Alcácer do Sal. The region produces a third of Portugal’s rice,
        apparently.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K781V8AD2Y94CRYNXYFY5KXG.jpeg" alt="From across the river, the old town with white houses and tiled roofs plus a church with two towers." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K781VBF0XFAYAHHC41TE4ZNA.jpeg" alt="Away from the river, flat lands with a big field of rice." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K781VD7HP3HFS54WXPJBVJM0.jpeg" alt="Standing on a bridge, a view of the city where all lines converge on a point: wetland, mud, river, street, houses, horizon." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K781VG142B6CKR3YZE12C2Z7.jpeg" alt="From the same bridge, a picture of the rice landscape where all lines converge on a point: water, mud, reeds, rice, trees, sky." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K781VMCT81T212E08C9RHMGQ.jpeg" alt="This is Portugal, too: an old house facade, totally ruined, windows walled shut, paint falling off, bricks visible, graffiti, ads. Everything is falling apart." /></p>
        
        <p>We stopped at Nossa Senhora de Guadelupe for the standing stones.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782P816RC9JBSEDDGN8ZKG3.jpeg" alt="Rounded standing stones. Nearly one hundred of them." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782PKGGGG289GKGHSWYPX4X.jpeg" alt="More standing stones and a cork oak." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782PZ8P3VBZBAV9TRKJ3HVA.jpeg" alt="A trail between wire fences. Left and right are cork oaks or olive trees." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782QBQFMM6KZ7B95AZ5PBHG.jpeg" alt="A standing stone, many metres tall." /></p>
        
        <p>We reached Évora.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782Z4FA53GJHZ7DYH1HJ1TG.jpeg" alt="A ruin of a Roman temple in the middle of a Portuguese town." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782Z8YMWTVCPFYHJJVWP2ND.jpeg" alt="A few columns reaching into the sky are all that remain of the old Diana or the old imperial temple. A reminder that all billionaires must eventually die." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K782ZNF8JXS7WGSH26MJYKC9.jpeg" alt="A view of Évora from a slightly elevated position. The buildings are white, with yellow highlight at the ground level and the corners, two stories high, with tiled roofs. The cobble-stone roads are narrow." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-11</strong>. Seeing so many martyrs dying, so many tortured Jesus
        sculptures, so many golden dresses, fancy hats, silver and gold, I am
        sick and tired of churches.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A4G59DCX13SCNMSR78K2HX.jpeg" alt="The ceiling is white, the walls above gold encrusted and full of paintings, the the walls below are made of blue and white ceramic tiles." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A4GAW841VX3GC6W6XJ1DSR.jpeg" alt="The columns support an impossibly high ceiling and in the far distance shines a golden altar." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A4GEZ50W0DVKC0HF7GK8CQ.jpeg" alt="I’m standing on the cathedral’s roof with sandals, long trousers and a white t-shirt and sunglasses, hat in hand." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A4HVVP699667KS48S3KJ7G.jpeg" alt="Looking from the roof of the cathedral into the cloister." /></p>
        
        <p>Coffee culture is very much to my liking. I also like the ceramic
        tiles, I guess. Very cool in summer and very different from what I see
        in Switzerland.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A4WGQRV6GT2S5PPXRJK6ZG.jpeg" alt="The backstreets of Évora with white walls, yellow color accents, and cobblestone roads." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A4WP21VAG0Z8XMB8EKK5B8.jpeg" alt="One of the rooms in the university. Feels like a wizarding school! Deep bordaux chairs, a band of painted tiles, white walls, and a wooden ceiling." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A4WSDHYXBDC04YE1YXJAFC.jpeg" alt="A traditional pastry and coffee place. You eat and drink while standing at the counter." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A53PC6DA07XZ4CH03WGJE9.jpeg" alt="Arcades at the university with blue on white tiles along the lower part of the walls. The doors lead to small lecture halls." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A53X3P4CW6F6FKN63PBYG5.jpeg" alt="Me, in a stairwell, looking up. Blue on white tiles decorate the lower part of the wall." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7A5747KQ4V0TVP8T9QX07MA.jpeg" alt="The university courtyard. Cobblestones, yellow accent, arcades, two floors." /></p>
        
        <p>They say that the Marquês de Pombal closed the university after two
        hundred years to kick the religious orders including the Jesuits out
        of Portugal in order to end the Inquisition. That doesn&rsquo;t sound so
        bad. He also helped out when the big earthquake struck in 1755. But
        when you read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_de_Carvalho_e_Melo,_1st_Marquis_of_Pombal">Wikipedia
        page</a>,
        a different man emerges. Optimizing the slave trade, for example.
        Uuuuugh.</p>
        
        <p>I feel like “no war but class war” would apply to him, too. I lived in
        Oeiras as a kid in the eighties and remember a part of his estate
        still exists.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-12</strong>. We went on a long drive around the reservoir behind
        the Alqueva Dam. It has a catchment area of 250 km² – it was filled in
        2003, long after I had left Portugal, so it was all new to me. We
        visited Monsaraz, first.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7CSE04TCGQHVK6KN2MK6TX3.jpeg" alt="Looking from old fortifications towards the lake." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7CSE32BXS9YK4WBAZD98QXV.jpeg" alt="Looking from old fortifications onto a small village on a hill with a church in the background." />

        <p>We went to Mourão, next. The town is small, the fortress is crumbling.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D1X666H3SVQNFPB900V6B5.jpeg" alt="The dry grass with the occasional olive tree and a huge water reservoir in the back." />

        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D21E98BBVEKDNQ1DN0TBEV.jpeg" alt="A panorama view from the old fortifications with Claudia standing in the middle." /></p>
        
        <p>By that time we were hungry and in the middle of sleepy Mourão we found a
        little park with a coffee stand where we had queijadas, café (espresso), galão
        (espresso with a lot of milk) and a small bottle of Pedras Salgadas (salty
        sparkling mineral water).</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D23NCRTBQ10Q88E26JNQ2Y.jpeg" alt="Me, on the main square, with the park in my back." />

        <p>We crossed the Alqueda Dam and went for a small walk.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/01K7D2CDQ0EC6499AC14E14P73.jpeg" alt="The lake, seen from the dam. It’s big." />

        <p>And finally, we went for a small walk from Alqueda to a side arm of the lake.
        There, I saw a water snake, a gazillion fish, a hare, several herons (big grey
        ones and smaller white ones), and then, suddenly, at the bend in the distance,
        a commotion. The water was wild. We saw three or for cormorants, hunting. And
        then, after moving slowly along the shore, they took flight. Claudia started
        counting and got to 25! So the three or four we saw where the ones on the
        surface and the madness in the water was the remaining twenty cormorants.
        Amazing.</p>

        <p><strong>2025-10-13</strong>. We drove from Évora to Estremoz. Our first two stops
        were Redondo and Vila Viçosa. Apparently the region between Vila
        Viçosa and Estremos has had marble quarries since Roman times and the
        region is still the second largest European marble export after
        Carrara in Italy. Or so it says in our tourist guide. A paper book! It
        must be true. They have so much marble that they use it for sidewalks
        and road signs, set into the cobblestone streets.</p>

        <p>Sadly, Estremoz is also a throwback to older times: wild dogs
        defending their territory. Wild cats and their young being fed in the
        street. Chained dogs barking and howling with fear and rage and
        torment. Bull fighting arenas. They don’t kill the bulls, they just
        torment them. And everywhere, ruins. Ruined industries. Ruined
        buildings.</p>

        <p>We didn’t go on a tour into the marble quarries but we went jogging
        and took some pictures from the street. There are no easy access
        points. Everything is fenced off.</p>

        <p>The Portuguese are very discrete. Their front entrances don’t have
        names. Their doorbells don’t have names. Their mailboxes don’t have
        names. Your letter might say for whom it is, in what village, street,
        number, floor, left or right – but the name is optional since the post
        people won’t be able to check. When they answer the phone, they just
        say “I’m here” but they don’t say their name. If you ask, it’s rude.
        The caller is supposed to state their name and who they’re trying to
        reach. This used to be very confusing for me and my family because in
        German-speaking phone culture the person picking up the phone says who
        they are, then the caller says who they are, and then the conversation
        proceeds.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes I wonder whether such privacy-consciousness is a consequence
        of having lived through a dictatorship.</p>
        
        <p>The view of a corporatist state (super into unions and against
        parties) who is opposed to both communism and liberalism is super
        interesting, if you want to know more:

        <p><strong>2025-10-14</strong>. Some more impressions of the fortifications – and
        here, too, a throwback to the eighties: people just dumping garbage
        over the wall.</p>

        <p><strong>2025-10-15</strong>. Today we were in Elvas. Without a drone, we couldn’t
        take any pictures from above. But we walked a lot. 😄 I’m skipping all
        the interior rooms, bunker-like tunnels and the nationalist and
        pro-army messages from 1959 on the walls.</p>
        
        <p>The <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1367/gallery/">UNESCO site</a> has
        some nice pictures.</p>

        <p><strong>2025-10-16</strong>. We drove to Marvão, another fortress town on the
        Portuguese side of the border.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>“The Portugal–Spain border, also referred to as &ldquo;the Stripe&rdquo;, is one of the
        oldest geopolitical borders in the world. The current demarcation is almost
        identical to that defined in 1297 by the Treaty of Alcañices.”
        &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal%E2%80%93Spain_border">Wikipedia</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>(This is not the Treaty of Tordesillas that divided up the globe.)</p>
        
        <p>Personally the most amazing thing is that there are Eurasian griffon vultures
        (Gyps fulvus) nesting in the cliff below. No phone pictures of these, however.</p>

        <p>Actually, if you zoom that one picture far enough, there’s a vulture far
        below.</p>

        <p>And look at that! Another praying mantis:</p>

        <p>We went on a long walk from Marvão to Castelo de Vide via Carreiras. I took a
        lot of pictures of the road. Often, we were walking on a medieval road.</p>

        <p><strong>2025-10-17</strong>. Today we went on a 60km drive to see the gap where the
        Tejo river breaks through the mountains to continue its journey to
        Lisbon. These are the Portas de Ródão. Not quite the Gates of Rohan,
        but close. 😂</p>
        
        <p>The paper industry loves Eucalyptus trees and the summer forest fires
        do, too. As a kid I was surprised to learn that the eucalyptus tree is
        not a Portuguese native! So now we imported both: the trees, and the
        forest fires.</p>

        <p>I feel that we’ll see more water reservoirs in central Europe as the
        climate heats up. Unless the North Atlantic Gulf Stream breaks down in
        which case we’ll get Canadian weather. Ugh!</p>

        <p>We got to the top of the Serra de São Miguel and walked towards the gap.</p>

        <p>What did impress us to no end, however, were the forty Eurasian
        griffon vultures we saw circling above us; the countless young we saw
        in the rock face; the adults coming and going. Such impressive birds.</p>

        <p>Our walk wasn&rsquo;t over, however. It was a long way back along the river and up another chain of hills.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-78.jpg" alt="I&rsquo;m walking in a light forest on a rough track." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-19</strong>. We left Portugal&rsquo;s east and drove towards Leiria.
        We&rsquo;re staying in Alvados near Porto de Mós, hoping to do some hiking
        in the Serras de Aire e Candeeiros Nature Park. It&rsquo;s near Fátima, if
        you know your way around famous pilgrimage destinations.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-3.jpg" alt="The view from our hotel window shows a wilderness trees and shrubs and a hill in the distance," /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-20</strong>. We went on the Fórnea walk: First along the foot of
        the hill through some olive groves, then into a valley where a
        waterfall shows up on rainy days, and finally onto the hill itself, to
        see the plateau, and back down.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-73.jpg" alt="Claudia and I are ready to go, wearing sunglasses and grinning." />

        <p>The olive trees are small so that the olives can be harvested without
        ladders. We saw a few farmers &ndash; often a man and a woman &ndash; cutting
        branches and stripping olives over a big net they had spread beneath
        the tree.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-8.jpg" alt="The waterfall is try. All we can see is a rock layer breaking through the hill side." /></p>
        
        <p>This is karst, where water disappears into underground caverns and the
        surface world is dry. But here, in this valley surrounded by hills,
        there is enough humidity to allow some lushness.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-9.jpg" alt="The trail is narrow and greenery rises on both sides." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-10.jpg" alt="The sky is overcast and Claudia and I are no longer wearing our sunglasses." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-11.jpg" alt="The dirt road continues and begins to rise in the distance." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-12.jpg" alt="We&rsquo;re further up now, looking back at the olive groves below." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-13.jpg" alt="The autumn crokus growing out of the ground without leaves, just a flower on a short stalk, continues to amaze me." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-14.jpg" alt="The plateau at the top of the hill features a gazillion little meadows, each surrounded by a dry stone wall." /></p>
        
        <p>The plateau up here is very humid. Is it the altitude? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
        
        <p>We also saws four dead fire salamanders. Huge ones! Apparently, the
        Portuguese fire salamanders are suffering from a fungus that damages
        their skin and kills them within a week or two. Was this the reason?
        The animals did not seem run over by a car or eaten by a carnivore.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-15.jpg" alt="Our trail led around the back of the hill top." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-16.jpg" alt="And finally, the view into the natural amphitheatre." /></p>
        
        <p>I keep thinking about the enclosures.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-17.jpg" alt="The sun is back and so are our sunglasses. We&rsquo;re still on the plateau with the green meadows and the dry stone walls." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-76.jpg" alt="The trail doesn&rsquo;t cross any meadows. It always goes between two walls separating these meadows." /></p>
        
        <p>Down there somewhere is the green valley we had seen before.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-18.jpg" alt="Claudia and our goal in the valley below." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-19.jpg" alt="Claudia" /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-21</strong>. We went to see some Dinosaur foot steps, Fátima and Batalha.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-20.jpg" alt="The dinosaur footsteps are in a plain of limestone that used to be the bottom of an old quarry." /></p>
        
        <p>The very nice and knowledgeable person who let us in during lunch
        break explained that the scientists had washed the depressions of the
        sauropod footsteps in order to make them more visible. The just
        cleaned the limestone of algae and lichen.</p>
        
        <p>They had also errected a wooden walkway above the limestone to protect
        the sauropod footsteps from humans. Unfortunately, the wood used had
        unexpectedly leaked fungicides and other toxins, killing off the
        lichen and algae growing on the limestone. The effect is that it looks
        just as whitewashed as the actual footstops the scientists had washed.
        It&rsquo;ll take fix or six years to grow back, we were told.</p>
        
        <p>The footsteps above the walkway are easy to spot, though.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-21.jpg" alt="Seen from above, we can see how the grey limestone is in fact washed white below a wooden footbridge, as if the wood had leaked white colour onto the grey limestone." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-23.jpg" alt="In black and white the footsteps above the walkway are pretty easy to see." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-22.jpg" alt="Claudia and I on the walkway, in black and white, grinning." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-24.jpg" alt="The limestone comes in layers that are easy to spot as they look like irregular stairs." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-25.jpg" alt="The limestone forms a karst landscape where the water disappears into the underworld. Here we see a hole in the limestone that looks like the beginning of a cave!" />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-26.jpg" alt="Looking away from the limestone for a moment, we see the landscape around the hill we&rsquo;re on. Shrubs, trees, meadows in the distance." /></p>
        
        <p>Fátima is an important pilgrimage destination for Catholics in Europe,
        like Lourdes in France or Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The square
        is huge. The church is huge. There are chapels underground. Some
        pilgrims do the last part of their pilgrimage on their knees.</p>
        
        <p>It drives tears to my eyes to see grown men and women debase
        themselves like that, in the rain, on the cold, hard stone, in 2025.
        It&rsquo;s revolting to see the prayer at the beginning of this passage say:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Most Holy Trinity<br>
        Father, Son and Holy Spirit,<br>
        I adore you profoundly.</p>
        
        <p>My heart rejoices<br>
        For the many blessings<br>
        You have bestowed upon me.<br>
        Accept this pilgrimage on my knees …</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>It&rsquo;s heart wrenching to see how these people believe, to imagine the
        torment and fear that brought them to this place, and to think that
        the church felt this was the best way to help them.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-72.jpg" alt="A big square, mostly empty. The sign mentioned above marks the beginning of the passage where some people, mostly middle aged women, are on their knees, in the rain." /></p>
        
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalha_Monastery">Monastery of Batalha</a>
        was erected in commemoration of the 1385 Battle of Aljubarrota where
        the Portuguese and their English allies defeated the Castile and their
        French allies as well as their Genoese mercenaries.</p>
        
        <p>I keep thinking about all the poor people that built all this shit.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-27.jpg" alt="An impressive old building, looks like a humongous church." />

        <p><strong>2025-10-22</strong>. We drove to our last hotel in A-dos-Cunhados, near the
        beach. On the way we stopped in Nazaré and Peniche, hoping to see some
        waves.</p>
        
        <p>I was hoping, against all odds, that we&rsquo;d see those 30m high waves in
        Nazaré. Sadly, no such luck.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-54.jpg" alt="I&rsquo;m standing in front of the famous lighthouse from where people stare at the high waves, if there are any. I&rsquo;m cold. There are some tourists, here." />

        <p>Peniche is another surfer hotspot but the waves where not impressive.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-56.jpg" alt="A wooden walkway leads through the dunes." />

        <p>We arrived at our hotel near Santa Cruz and discovered that there was a footpath to the beach!</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-58.jpg" alt="Claudia is walking through the hotel gardens." />

        <p>The hotel we&rsquo;re staying in has a the best bathtub I have ever seen.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-portugal/image-70.jpg" alt="It looks like a concrete bathtub set into the floor." /></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-10-23</strong>. We met my mom in Mafra, saw the royal summer palace,
        built by 45,000 people over 13 years (including a lot of forced
        labour) and then it was only used for a few years. Royalty is misery.</p>

        <p>The plant that’s growing in large green-reddish patches on the sand up here is <em>Gelbe Mittagsblume</em> or <em>Carpobrotus edulis</em>, with thick, sharply triangular fingers reaching up from the ground. An invasive species, if I remember correctly.</p>

      <source:markdown># Portugal 2025

We spent three weeks in Portugal.

I thought October was great since the main season ends mid September.
But there are still a lot of people in the Lisbon region!

[#Portugal](/search/?q=%23Portugal) [#Pictures](/search/?q=%23Pictures)

**2025-10-04**. The first day we went for a walk from Estoril to
Cascais with my stepmom and her sister.

![Me, my stepmom, my wife, and my stepmom’s sister, all with sunglasses and grinning into the camera, with the bright sky and the blue ocean in our back.](2025-portugal/01K6XARZJWQCH73Y5HMDWBT9BX.jpeg)

**2025-10-04**. The second day we went to Ericeira with my mom and two
of her friends, watching the ocean and then going to eat seafood. Very
nice.

![The beach of Ericeira, protected by a long arm of rock and concrete, with a beach that’s very empty, with fishing boats and boxes and cages all pilled high behind the beach, a 10m cliff (or more) and houses above.](2025-portugal/01K6XAS0D7MHFTF4CWX6S3RZK5.jpeg)![A picture from the foot of the cliff where big chunks have fallen from above and white houses lean precariously close to the edge above.](2025-portugal/01K6XAS2EG6QDDE7PVJCQ16VET.jpeg)![The view from above where my wife and I are waving, if you zoom in far enough.](2025-portugal/01K6XAS4S7SQC8P3SWHZX98KGP.jpeg)

**2025-10-06**. On the third day we went to see Sintra. So many
people! So many cars. So little parking.

![My wife and my stepmom in front of a wine bar.](2025-portugal/01K6XB7K0TPPGNYBHYJAYPS8A3.jpeg)![Looking at a forested hill with a castle wall at the top.](2025-portugal/01K6XB7N2P769PECS4JD2DW341.jpeg)![A few houses and a church from above, with lots of green trees.](2025-portugal/01K6XB7Q0D55W7HVSWYRJZSHH3.jpeg)![My wife in the gardens of the old royal summer palace in Sintra, leaning against a wall with geometric ceramic tiles.](2025-portugal/01K6XB7S1QFFSKM280A7ZM62KJ.jpeg)

**2025-10-07**. We ended the fourth day at
[Severa](https://www.asevera.com/en/fado-restaurant/), one of the Fado
places in Lisbon. I usually go to Clube do Fado but my stepmother
knows the places to go and Faia had no tables left.

**2025-10-08**. On the fifth day we went to in Palmela, an old
fortress town north of Setúbal. The view is great. From now on it’s
just the two of us.

![Driving over a long bridge. The concrete looks like a big H with “rays” of metal streaming towards us.](2025-portugal/01K7261CQX4B6SFETX2MMH9WJP.jpeg)![Looking down a dry hill with a winding unpaved road towards a harbour city.](2025-portugal/01K7261E4CZKC88SXBZQBN68P8.jpeg)

The region is famous for Muscatel wine. We tasted some and it was great. And
we had some dried sheep cheese, a very soft cheese from Azeitão, pumpkin jam
and bread. Super tasty. And we didn’t even have dinner.

![The old town and a park and the hill with the old fortress at the top.](2025-portugal/01K72EGE70C2GZ5HGJKWAVTZ8M.jpeg)![Cobblestone streets, house facades covered in ceramic tiles, clothes on washing lines out to dry, iron wrought balcony railings. Sadly, also cars.](2025-portugal/01K72EGGSXZCXVP6PEGW957D21.jpeg)

**2025-10-09**. We went towards the Cape Espiche and walked to an old
ruin and back. Perfect weather. This is the area west of Sesimbra in
the Serra d’Arrábida.

![A dirt road loading towards the coastline.](2025-portugal/01K74Z8YCCCPSCMETHZVVFS8DX.jpeg)![Up here the grass is very dry. Some dry thistles in the foreground.](2025-portugal/01K74Z90NE4GC7K5Z9SAGFJGYQ.jpeg)![The small strip of coast that drops off towards the ocean is green. It looks like a 30 degree angle, and then a steep drop.](2025-portugal/01K74Z93CCNW0TY1BDSD95QEHV.jpeg)![At the far end, a ruin and the ocean in the sun.](2025-portugal/01K74Z96RAXD5E7V4CKRQW0CYF.jpeg)

I had never seen a praying mantis before. This one was moving very
slowly on the dirt path.

![A green insect on red dust, a bit like a grasshopper, but the back legs are very thin and the front legs are huge.](2025-portugal/01K76MY6D1NGD9JSSVKXWFJDQ3.jpeg)

At the Cabo Espichel there was a closed church and a ruined building
that looked like a two storey hostel with windows walled shut. It
looked depressing and I did not take any pictures. I preferred looking
at the coastline and the sea.

![The steep coastline at Cabo Espichel where the flat land drops into the sea below.](2025-portugal/image-1.jpg)

On the way back we stopped in Sesimbra, had coffee and watched people
walk by. A perfect way to chill out before returning to the hotel.

![Claudia and I drinking coffee. A galão is usually a morning drink: a glass of milk with a shot of espresso and no milk foam, unlike a latte macchiato.](2025-portugal/image-2.jpg)

**2025-10-10**. Today we drove to Évora and on the way we stopped at
Alcácer do Sal. The region produces a third of Portugal’s rice,
apparently.

![From across the river, the old town with white houses and tiled roofs plus a church with two towers.](2025-portugal/01K781V8AD2Y94CRYNXYFY5KXG.jpeg)![Away from the river, flat lands with a big field of rice.](2025-portugal/01K781VBF0XFAYAHHC41TE4ZNA.jpeg)![Standing on a bridge, a view of the city where all lines converge on a point: wetland, mud, river, street, houses, horizon.](2025-portugal/01K781VD7HP3HFS54WXPJBVJM0.jpeg)![From the same bridge, a picture of the rice landscape where all lines converge on a point: water, mud, reeds, rice, trees, sky.](2025-portugal/01K781VG142B6CKR3YZE12C2Z7.jpeg)![This is Portugal, too: an old house facade, totally ruined, windows walled shut, paint falling off, bricks visible, graffiti, ads. Everything is falling apart.](2025-portugal/01K781VMCT81T212E08C9RHMGQ.jpeg)

We stopped at Nossa Senhora de Guadelupe for the standing stones.

We reached Évora.

**2025-10-11**. Seeing so many martyrs dying, so many tortured Jesus
sculptures, so many golden dresses, fancy hats, silver and gold, I am
sick and tired of churches.

![The ceiling is white, the walls above gold encrusted and full of paintings, the the walls below are made of blue and white ceramic tiles.](2025-portugal/01K7A4G59DCX13SCNMSR78K2HX.jpeg)![The columns support an impossibly high ceiling and in the far distance shines a golden altar.](2025-portugal/01K7A4GAW841VX3GC6W6XJ1DSR.jpeg)![I’m standing on the cathedral’s roof with sandals, long trousers and a white t-shirt and sunglasses, hat in hand.](2025-portugal/01K7A4GEZ50W0DVKC0HF7GK8CQ.jpeg)![Looking from the roof of the cathedral into the cloister.](2025-portugal/01K7A4HVVP699667KS48S3KJ7G.jpeg)

Coffee culture is very much to my liking. I also like the ceramic
tiles, I guess. Very cool in summer and very different from what I see
in Switzerland.

They say that the Marquês de Pombal closed the university after two
hundred years to kick the religious orders including the Jesuits out
of Portugal in order to end the Inquisition. That doesn’t sound so
bad. He also helped out when the big earthquake struck in 1755. But
when you read the [Wikipedia\
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_de_Carvalho_e_Melo,_1st_Marquis_of_Pombal),
a different man emerges. Optimizing the slave trade, for example.
Uuuuugh.

I feel like “no war but class war” would apply to him, too. I lived in
Oeiras as a kid in the eighties and remember a part of his estate
still exists.

**2025-10-12**. We went on a long drive around the reservoir behind
the Alqueva Dam. It has a catchment area of 250 km² – it was filled in
2003, long after I had left Portugal, so it was all new to me. We
visited Monsaraz, first.

We went to Mourão, next. The town is small, the fortress is crumbling.

![The dry grass with the occasional olive tree and a huge water reservoir in the back.](2025-portugal/01K7D1X666H3SVQNFPB900V6B5.jpeg)![Crumbling fortifications and a white church in the middle of it.](2025-portugal/01K7D1X8HERN1J0WZKCGF35Q20.jpeg)![A panorama view from the old fortifications with Claudia standing in the middle.](2025-portugal/01K7D21E98BBVEKDNQ1DN0TBEV.jpeg)

By that time we were hungry and in the middle of sleepy Mourão we found a
little park with a coffee stand where we had queijadas, café (espresso), galão
(espresso with a lot of milk) and a small bottle of Pedras Salgadas (salty
sparkling mineral water).

![Me, on the main square, with the park in my back.](2025-portugal/01K7D23NCRTBQ10Q88E26JNQ2Y.jpeg)![A kiosk hiding under some trees.](2025-portugal/01K7D23RMXNMB84BBD3PAP8ZJT.jpeg)![Claudia sitting at the table, eating cake.](2025-portugal/01K7D23V6VE7TR3EVSHFYXHM68.jpeg)![Me, drinking coffee.](2025-portugal/01K7D23YSY95DQS28Z6K7DGQWE.jpeg)

We crossed the Alqueda Dam and went for a small walk.

![The lake, seen from the dam. It’s big.](2025-portugal/01K7D2CDQ0EC6499AC14E14P73.jpeg)![The dam infrastructure behind the dam. It’s big. There are emergency overflows and electrical things.

Like a lake.](2025-portugal/01K7D2CJAR1EPAT8Y1CR83Y7HN.jpeg)

And finally, we went for a small walk from Alqueda to a side arm of the lake.
There, I saw a water snake, a gazillion fish, a hare, several herons (big grey
ones and smaller white ones), and then, suddenly, at the bend in the distance,
a commotion. The water was wild. We saw three or for cormorants, hunting. And
then, after moving slowly along the shore, they took flight. Claudia started
counting and got to 25! So the three or four we saw where the ones on the
surface and the madness in the water was the remaining twenty cormorants.
Amazing.

**2025-10-13**. We drove from Évora to Estremoz. Our first two stops
were Redondo and Vila Viçosa. Apparently the region between Vila
Viçosa and Estremos has had marble quarries since Roman times and the
region is still the second largest European marble export after
Carrara in Italy. Or so it says in our tourist guide. A paper book! It
must be true. They have so much marble that they use it for sidewalks
and road signs, set into the cobblestone streets.

![Typical one and two story houses, chalked white, with yellow or blue accents. The one on the right is Porfirio’s restaurant (closed).](2025-portugal/01K7HF42DTD6KXZ9CYHQ4H5GN4.jpeg)![Old fortifications with a gate and white buildings visible inside the old town.](2025-portugal/01K7HF45FPJMRR8PBR9TAF4W1X.jpeg)![The sidewalk is made of white and purple marble.

Marble everywhere.

![A church with a half a facade made of marble.](2025-portugal/01K7HFFY3W5XAQ1AQ8PD2BZVSD.jpeg)![A large square and an old royal palace made of marble.](2025-portugal/01K7HFFZ1JW9Z297VZD0563FQB.jpeg)![Me, in front the palace showing how its facade is made of white and light greyish blue marble.](2025-portugal/01K7HFG0520G7QR3HR65BS6ATM.jpeg)![A city square with benches and small trees, and the cobblestones are marble pieces and half the benches are made of marble.](2025-portugal/01K7HFG1SY3QH3SCRN6JV3N1J7.jpeg)

Sadly, Estremoz is also a throwback to older times: wild dogs
defending their territory. Wild cats and their young being fed in the
street. Chained dogs barking and howling with fear and rage and
torment. Bull fighting arenas. They don’t kill the bulls, they just
torment them. And everywhere, ruins. Ruined industries. Ruined
buildings.

These pictures are from Vila Viçosa, Borba and Estremoz.

![A ruined factory with plans of a luxury hotel posted.](2025-portugal/01K7HFW61VS41KP943HFMJ6RE6.jpeg)![Looking through an opening of a building in the old town.](2025-portugal/01K7HFW7Q1ECP82GN802Q4S4V2.jpeg)![Fallen ceilings, crumbling walls.](2025-portugal/01K7HFWAK5CHWY2DC3DJRPEKR6.jpeg)![Another broken factory in the evening sun.](2025-portugal/01K7HFWD2SNQ0AJXS5N87PNKPQ.jpeg)

We didn’t go on a tour into the marble quarries but we went jogging
and took some pictures from the street. There are no easy access
points. Everything is fenced off.

The Portuguese are very discrete. Their front entrances don’t have
names. Their doorbells don’t have names. Their mailboxes don’t have
names. Your letter might say for whom it is, in what village, street,
number, floor, left or right – but the name is optional since the post
people won’t be able to check. When they answer the phone, they just
say “I’m here” but they don’t say their name. If you ask, it’s rude.
The caller is supposed to state their name and who they’re trying to
reach. This used to be very confusing for me and my family because in
German-speaking phone culture the person picking up the phone says who
they are, then the caller says who they are, and then the conversation
proceeds.

Sometimes I wonder whether such privacy-consciousness is a consequence
of having lived through a dictatorship.

The view of a corporatist state (super into unions and against
parties) who is opposed to both communism and liberalism is super
interesting, if you want to know more:
[Estado Novo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estado_Novo_(Portugal)).

**2025-10-14**. Some more impressions of the fortifications – and
here, too, a throwback to the eighties: people just dumping garbage
over the wall.

![A marble tower! It is not quite white but clearly made of a different material.](2025-portugal/01K7HNN97518ZC21F8CKMBS7PZ.jpeg)![A marble gate in the city wall with my wife on the drawbridge.

**2025-10-15**. Today we were in Elvas. Without a drone, we couldn’t
take any pictures from above. But we walked a lot. 😄 I’m skipping all
the interior rooms, bunker-like tunnels and the nationalist and
pro-army messages from 1959 on the walls.

The [UNESCO site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1367/gallery/) has
some nice pictures.

Elvas itself is similar except there’s an entire town up here.

**2025-10-16**. We drove to Marvão, another fortress town on the
Portuguese side of the border.

&#62; “The Portugal–Spain border, also referred to as “the Stripe”, is one of the
&#62; oldest geopolitical borders in the world. The current demarcation is almost
&#62; identical to that defined in 1297 by the Treaty of Alcañices.”
&#62; – [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal%E2%80%93Spain_border)

(This is not the Treaty of Tordesillas that divided up the globe.)

Personally the most amazing thing is that there are Eurasian griffon vultures
(Gyps fulvus) nesting in the cliff below. No phone pictures of these, however.

![The outer walls with a little park](2025-portugal/01K7PYXC784YK6FHY4GC8Q6ZS8.jpeg)![The main tower and more walls on a hilltop.](2025-portugal/01K7PYY7E61JPVTKHM454YRYGZ.jpeg)![The fortress seen from the city park.](2025-portugal/01K7PYYHN4YN8V7V8NZHX9SB9A.jpeg)![The surprisingly green valley below.](2025-portugal/01K7PYYRG2MNHF39ZENX41Z3TF.jpeg)

Actually, if you zoom that one picture far enough, there’s a vulture far
below.

![A vaguely bird-like shape of grey flying above some trees.](2025-portugal/01K7PZ6TE8FTQKS5BZB4ETZ3T1.jpeg)

And look at that! Another praying mantis:

![My second praying mantis. My wife spotted it while we were walking past it.](2025-portugal/01K7PYYT7H0HRE0RHQ8SHMXEXC.jpeg)

We went on a long walk from Marvão to Castelo de Vide via Carreiras. I took a
lot of pictures of the road. Often, we were walking on a medieval road.

Where the bark has been taken off, they are rust-coloured.](2025-portugal/01K7SM85WP27XE35GXJQKYAT2Y.jpeg)![Dry stone walls to the left and right.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8A461QAVYAVCFTB70232.jpeg)![Thorny shrubs to the left and right.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8DYCCTZNQCJT9J7EDX6J.jpeg)![More dry stone walls to the left and right.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8J3B4Q6QKB70NY667M3H.jpeg)![A paved road and dry stone walls on both sides.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8MBY2MP4W8R3Q17P4WYB.jpeg)![My wife and I, both with sunglasses and wide-brimmed hats.](2025-portugal/01K7SM8PMYAK7078ZNHY71TCMX.jpeg)![A gravel road towards a green hill.](2025-portugal/01K7SME95Q6YMSMF8YMRYB4BDX.jpeg)![A medieval road through a light forest.](2025-portugal/01K7SMEDWWBKY406HE2PJDTWT0.jpeg)

As we approached the end of the hike, we descended a slope that must have
burned not so long ago.

![A paved road through a black and brown burned forest.](2025-portugal/01K7SMEHK3STDE6T3SRP1YKREK.jpeg)![A medieval road past some blackened trees.

**2025-10-17**. Today we went on a 60km drive to see the gap where the
Tejo river breaks through the mountains to continue its journey to
Lisbon. These are the Portas de Ródão. Not quite the Gates of Rohan,
but close. 😂

The paper industry loves Eucalyptus trees and the summer forest fires
do, too. As a kid I was surprised to learn that the eucalyptus tree is
not a Portuguese native! So now we imported both: the trees, and the
forest fires.

![When we left the village, the dirt road lead through dry meadows and light eucalyptus forests.](2025-portugal/01K7WARZRTAC9X3XY01CE09SD0.jpeg)

I feel that we’ll see more water reservoirs in central Europe as the
climate heats up. Unless the North Atlantic Gulf Stream breaks down in
which case we’ll get Canadian weather. Ugh!

![A surprising number of water reservoirs. The water is a horrible green but we saw big frogs.](2025-portugal/01K7WAS4KD08T4TWRWQZAXY720.jpeg)

Coming from Switzerland, mountain chain is not very impressive.

![More eucalyptus trees.](2025-portugal/01K7WAS8K2G0VS5N2FQ5C78M1P.jpeg)![Further up, some pine trees.](2025-portugal/01K7WASDG3K3KBYYE315VXBKYM.jpeg)

We got to the top of the Serra de São Miguel and walked towards the gap.

![Looking back at the flat lands we came from. Some bright green bushes.](2025-portugal/01K7WB3SHGGA0HNPZV1EJ2FKP0.jpeg)![Claudia standing next to a hole in the rock wall. It’s an old gold mine and the sign says not to enter.](2025-portugal/01K7WB3XZ6Q0JK8K5ZRBBSK280.jpeg)![Looking east, the river is wide and slow. Trees. A bridge.

What did impress us to no end, however, were the forty Eurasian
griffon vultures we saw circling above us; the countless young we saw
in the rock face; the adults coming and going. Such impressive birds.

6s of vultures circling above.

4s of vultures flying below.

11s of vultures returning home to their cliff.

![I wanted to take a funny selfie of Claudia and me so I’m pulling a face but Claudia has spotted some vultures and is no longer interested in the selfie, excitedly pointing elsewhere.](2025-portugal/image-75.jpg)![Claudia and I smiling at the camera.](2025-portugal/image-79.jpg)

Our walk wasn’t over, however. It was a long way back along the river and up another chain of hills.

![I’m walking in a light forest on a rough track.](2025-portugal/image-78.jpg)

**2025-10-19**. We left Portugal’s east and drove towards Leiria.
We’re staying in Alvados near Porto de Mós, hoping to do some hiking
in the Serras de Aire e Candeeiros Nature Park. It’s near Fátima, if
you know your way around famous pilgrimage destinations.

![The view from our hotel window shows a wilderness trees and shrubs and a hill in the distance,](2025-portugal/image-3.jpg)

**2025-10-20**. We went on the Fórnea walk: First along the foot of
the hill through some olive groves, then into a valley where a
waterfall shows up on rainy days, and finally onto the hill itself, to
see the plateau, and back down.

![Claudia and I are ready to go, wearing sunglasses and grinning.](2025-portugal/image-73.jpg)![A dirt road winds itself through shrubland towards the hills in the distance.](2025-portugal/image-4.jpg)![The grass is dry, the thistles brown.](2025-portugal/image-5.jpg)

The olive trees are small so that the olives can be harvested without
ladders. We saw a few farmers – often a man and a woman – cutting
branches and stripping olives over a big net they had spread beneath
the tree.

![Small olive trees to the left and right of the dirt road.](2025-portugal/image-6.jpg)![The trail turns towards the mountains. It’s aiming for a gap.](2025-portugal/image-7.jpg)![The waterfall is try. All we can see is a rock layer breaking through the hill side.](2025-portugal/image-8.jpg)

This is karst, where water disappears into underground caverns and the
surface world is dry. But here, in this valley surrounded by hills,
there is enough humidity to allow some lushness.

![The trail is narrow and greenery rises on both sides.](2025-portugal/image-9.jpg)![The sky is overcast and Claudia and I are no longer wearing our sunglasses.](2025-portugal/image-10.jpg)![The dirt road continues and begins to rise in the distance.](2025-portugal/image-11.jpg)![We’re further up now, looking back at the olive groves below.](2025-portugal/image-12.jpg)![The autumn crokus growing out of the ground without leaves, just a flower on a short stalk, continues to amaze me.](2025-portugal/image-13.jpg)![The plateau at the top of the hill features a gazillion little meadows, each surrounded by a dry stone wall.](2025-portugal/image-14.jpg)

The plateau up here is very humid. Is it the altitude? I don’t know.

We also saws four dead fire salamanders. Huge ones! Apparently, the
Portuguese fire salamanders are suffering from a fungus that damages
their skin and kills them within a week or two. Was this the reason?
The animals did not seem run over by a car or eaten by a carnivore.

![Our trail led around the back of the hill top.](2025-portugal/image-15.jpg)![And finally, the view into the natural amphitheatre.](2025-portugal/image-16.jpg)

I keep thinking about the enclosures.

![The sun is back and so are our sunglasses. We’re still on the plateau with the green meadows and the dry stone walls.](2025-portugal/image-17.jpg)![The trail doesn’t cross any meadows. It always goes between two walls separating these meadows.](2025-portugal/image-76.jpg)

Down there somewhere is the green valley we had seen before.

![Claudia and our goal in the valley below.](2025-portugal/image-18.jpg)![Claudia](2025-portugal/image-19.jpg)

**2025-10-21**. We went to see some Dinosaur foot steps, Fátima and Batalha.

![The dinosaur footsteps are in a plain of limestone that used to be the bottom of an old quarry.](2025-portugal/image-20.jpg)

The very nice and knowledgeable person who let us in during lunch
break explained that the scientists had washed the depressions of the
sauropod footsteps in order to make them more visible. The just
cleaned the limestone of algae and lichen.

They had also errected a wooden walkway above the limestone to protect
the sauropod footsteps from humans. Unfortunately, the wood used had
unexpectedly leaked fungicides and other toxins, killing off the
lichen and algae growing on the limestone. The effect is that it looks
just as whitewashed as the actual footstops the scientists had washed.
It’ll take fix or six years to grow back, we were told.

The footsteps above the walkway are easy to spot, though.

![Seen from above, we can see how the grey limestone is in fact washed white below a wooden footbridge, as if the wood had leaked white colour onto the grey limestone.](2025-portugal/image-21.jpg)![In black and white the footsteps above the walkway are pretty easy to see.](2025-portugal/image-23.jpg)![Claudia and I on the walkway, in black and white, grinning.](2025-portugal/image-22.jpg)![The limestone comes in layers that are easy to spot as they look like irregular stairs.](2025-portugal/image-24.jpg)![The limestone forms a karst landscape where the water disappears into the underworld. Here we see a hole in the limestone that looks like the beginning of a cave!](2025-portugal/image-25.jpg)![Looking away from the limestone for a moment, we see the landscape around the hill we’re on. Shrubs, trees, meadows in the distance.](2025-portugal/image-26.jpg)

Fátima is an important pilgrimage destination for Catholics in Europe,
like Lourdes in France or Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The square
is huge. The church is huge. There are chapels underground. Some
pilgrims do the last part of their pilgrimage on their knees.

It drives tears to my eyes to see grown men and women debase
themselves like that, in the rain, on the cold, hard stone, in 2025.
It’s revolting to see the prayer at the beginning of this passage say:

&#62; Most Holy Trinity
&#62;
&#62; Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
&#62;
&#62; I adore you profoundly.
&#62;
&#62; My heart rejoices
&#62;
&#62; For the many blessings
&#62;
&#62; You have bestowed upon me.
&#62;
&#62; Accept this pilgrimage on my knees …

It’s heart wrenching to see how these people believe, to imagine the
torment and fear that brought them to this place, and to think that
the church felt this was the best way to help them.

![A big square, mostly empty. The sign mentioned above marks the beginning of the passage where some people, mostly middle aged women, are on their knees, in the rain.](2025-portugal/image-72.jpg)

The [Monastery of Batalha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalha_Monastery)
was erected in commemoration of the 1385 Battle of Aljubarrota where
the Portuguese and their English allies defeated the Castile and their
French allies as well as their Genoese mercenaries.

I keep thinking about all the poor people that built all this shit.

![An impressive old building, looks like a humongous church.](2025-portugal/image-27.jpg)![A huge church, impossibly high ceiling, unadorned columns, an altar in the far distance.](2025-portugal/image-28.jpg)![I’m admiring the ceiling and the columns. Everything is tall and I am small.](2025-portugal/image-44.jpg)![What I see when I look up is an impossibly high ceiling.](2025-portugal/image-45.jpg)![Between a huge column and a huge sarcophagus there’s a gap where we can see Claudia reading a poster about the people buried here.](2025-portugal/image-29.jpg)![The sarcophagus again, showing how big it is. These are actually two sarcophagi side by side, for John I and Philippa.](2025-portugal/image-30.jpg)![The one sweet thing is that the tomb effigies are holding hands.](2025-portugal/image-47.jpg)![There are many more sarcophagi in this chamber and I’m standing there, not knowing what to think.](2025-portugal/image-48.jpg)![Looking up at the ceiling and its many windows.](2025-portugal/image-49.jpg)![The cloister.](2025-portugal/image-31.jpg)![Overlooking the little park in the cloister.](2025-portugal/image-32.jpg)![Claudia standing in a chapel in front of a stained glass window.](2025-portugal/image-33.jpg)![A detail of a well in a corner of the cloister.](2025-portugal/image-34.jpg)

**2025-10-22**. We drove to our last hotel in A-dos-Cunhados, near the
beach. On the way we stopped in Nazaré and Peniche, hoping to see some
waves.

I was hoping, against all odds, that we’d see those 30m high waves in
Nazaré. Sadly, no such luck.

![I’m standing in front of the famous lighthouse from where people stare at the high waves, if there are any. I’m cold. There are some tourists, here.](2025-portugal/image-54.jpg)![The northern beach with almost nobody on it and a grey sky above. A sign warns of the crumbling cliffs.](2025-portugal/image-55.jpg)![Claudia and I, with the wind raising my hair so that I look quite silly.](2025-portugal/image-36.jpg)

Peniche is another surfer hotspot but the waves where not impressive.

![A wooden walkway leads through the dunes.](2025-portugal/image-56.jpg)![Looking at the beach. A handful of surfers in their neoprene suits are waiting for waves.](2025-portugal/image-38.jpg)![Claudia and I having a good time, grinning at the camera.](2025-portugal/image-37.jpg)

We arrived at our hotel near Santa Cruz and discovered that there was a footpath to the beach!

![Claudia is walking through the hotel gardens.](2025-portugal/image-58.jpg)![Close to the hotel, the dunes are not protected.](2025-portugal/image-59.jpg)![Claudia looking wonderful, smiling.](2025-portugal/image-60.jpg)![Claudia walking through the dunes.](2025-portugal/image-61.jpg)![I’m sitting on a little bench, looking at the sea.](2025-portugal/image-62.jpg)![Looking from the top of the cliff at the ocean.](2025-portugal/image-41.jpg)![I’m standing on a wooden walkway that leads across the dunes towards the cliffs and the sea.](2025-portugal/image-39.jpg)![We found the stairs down to the beach.](2025-portugal/image-63.jpg)![Claudia is standing on one leg at the beach, looking joyful. The beach ends at a cliff that somewhere 15m high, I’d guess. ](2025-portugal/image-40.jpg)![The water cold and I’m hesitating to go in.](2025-portugal/image-43.jpg)![Claudia and I, happy at the beach.](2025-portugal/image-68.jpg)![Claudia and I, making funny grimaces.](2025-portugal/image-69.jpg)

The hotel we’re staying in has a the best bathtub I have ever seen.

![It looks like a concrete bathtub set into the floor.](2025-portugal/image-70.jpg)

**2025-10-23**. We met my mom in Mafra, saw the royal summer palace,
built by 45,000 people over 13 years (including a lot of forced
labour) and then it was only used for a few years. Royalty is misery.

![The lazaret looks remarkably like an emergency entry of a hospital to day with each bed having a little alcove and a curtain. What dates it is the huge altar at the end.](2025-portugal/image-35.jpg)![Before the invention of corridors the rich just had room after room after room. In this case opening all the doors reveals over 200m of rooms.](2025-portugal/image-65.jpg)![The royal prayer room, small but luxurious.](2025-portugal/image-66.jpg)![A marble ceiling in light red, blue and yellow.](2025-portugal/image-67.jpg)![Marble floors and long hallways.](2025-portugal/image-71.jpg)![A garden on the inside.](2025-portugal/image-74.jpg)

**2025-10-24**. We spent our day on the beach.

The plant that’s growing in large green-reddish patches on the sand up here is _Gelbe Mittagsblume_ or _Carpobrotus edulis_, with thick, sharply triangular fingers reaching up from the ground. An invasive species, if I remember correctly.

![The beach! Not pictured: the constant roaring of the waves.](2025-portugal/image-81.jpg)![A view of the sea from the cliffs above.](2025-portugal/image-82.jpg)![Claudia literally pulling my face into a grin. So happy!](2025-portugal/image-77.jpg)![Claudia and I, laughing.](2025-portugal/image-80.jpg)![The footpath along the coast between patches of Carpobrotus edulis.](2025-portugal/image-83.jpg)![Looking at the beach from above as we haven’t taken the stairs down to the sea, yet.](2025-portugal/image-84.jpg)![We’re at the beach, now. The waves keep rolling in.](2025-portugal/image-85.jpg)![Me, walking along the beach, grey clouds above and the waves to my right. I’m so happy.](2025-portugal/image-86.jpg)![Red algae washed ashore, with oily air bubbles in many colours. A blue one is reflecting the sky and me taking the picture and Claudia overlooking my shoulders.](2025-portugal/image-87.jpg)![A large rock at the end of Guincho beach reflected in the water of retracting waves.](2025-portugal/image-88.jpg)![Rocks peeking out of the sand.](2025-portugal/image-89.jpg)![Me, looking at the camera, with the sea and the waves below me.](2025-portugal/image-90.jpg)![Santa Cruz has a lot of vista points. Here we’re looking back at that rock on Guincho beach.](2025-portugal/image-91.jpg)![Looking north towards where we need to go. The haze prevents us from seeing our goal but the beach is long and empty and there is enough sunlight left.](2025-portugal/image-92.jpg)![Our footsteps in the sand as we walk back to the hotel. This is our last evening of the trip.](2025-portugal/image-93.jpg)

**2025-10-25**. Time to return home!

![Claudia and I, looking happy in black and white. Claudia has a mischievous grin.](2025-portugal/image-94.jpg)</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>**[GenAI Image Editing Showdown](https://genai-showdown.specr.net/image-editing)**

Useful collection of examples by Shaun Pedicini who tested Seedream 4, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen-Image-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext \[dev\], FLUX.1 Kontext \[max\], OmniGen2, and OpenAI gpt-image-1 across 12 image editing prompts.

The tasks are very neatly selected, for example:

&#62; `Remove all the brown pieces of candy from the glass bowl`

Qwen-Image-Edit (a model that [can be self-hosted](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/19/qwen-image-edit/)) was the only one to successfully manage that!

This kind of collection is really useful for building up an intuition as to how well image editing models work, and which ones are worth trying for which categories of task.

Shaun has [a similar page for text-to-image models](https://genai-showdown.specr.net/) which are not fed an initial image to modify, with further challenging prompts like:

&#62; `Two Prussian soldiers wearing spiked pith helmets are facing each other and playing a game of ring toss by attempting to toss metal rings over the spike on the other soldier&#39;s helmet.`

      <title>Still unfinished, still shareable</title>
      <link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/still-unfinished-still-shareable/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A little while back (six months ago) I <a href="https://kwon.nyc/notes/unfinished-but-shareable/">wrote</a> about how I made a random page featuring my <a href="https://kwon.nyc/dad-hats/">dad&rsquo;s hats</a> and how I want to make more evergreen content and share more photos and visual things here.</p>
        <p>For some things in my life I have become very decisive but this website is not one of them. Lol. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s one of my few creative practices that I do purely for fun and so I feel a lot of pressure to make it amazing.</p>
        <p>In my work life, I have gotten fairly reliable at managing my own projects, and collaborating with other people who are managing their own. I have also taken a similar approach to life admin and organization; I am at the point in my life where managing my own health and finances are also projects that need to be managed and tracked; not because I am particularly un/healthy or un/wealthy, but more because when you&rsquo;ve been around for a few decades there&rsquo;s just more STUFF that you generate with regard to taking care of yourself.</p>
        <p>Anyway, all that is fine, but I just&hellip; don&rsquo;t necessarily want to feel like I&rsquo;m project-managing a thing in my personal life something that&rsquo;s supposed purely for fun, i.e., this website. And unfortunately that has translated to many ideas that seem exciting at first but then as soon as I&rsquo;ve documented one and decided to try and execute on it, it languishes. I have also incurred quite a bit of technical debt on this website based on fleeting decisions I made years ago, which also makes me hesitate to just build something even if it&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
        <p>The &ldquo;personal website as digital garden&rdquo; metaphor is one that many people have resonated with, and for good reason. &ldquo;Working with the garage door open&rdquo; is another one I like, especially because it unlocks some core memories of my suburban midwestern upbringing. And remember those &ldquo;Under Construction&rdquo; signs (gifs) we used to put on pages on our websites, before reverse-chronological blogging was a thing? I like that metaphor, too. At some point you just have to describe the thing and not use the metaphor as an entire allegory, though.</p>
        <p>Well, the whole point of this was to share some things I have been gingerly working on lately &ndash; think of it as me working on the garden in my garage with the door open and a construction sign in the driveway :)</p>
        <p>So anyway&hellip; I made these (<em>throws them on the ground in front of you and runs away</em>):</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong><a href="https://index.kwon.nyc/">index.kwon.nyc</a></strong>: An index page, as a way to track updates and show the delta between what this site is today and all my grand plans for it &ndash; maybe they will materialize faster if I create some accountability for myself by publishing them there. Or maybe I&rsquo;ll continue to think of fun ideas and then stare at my own belly button for months. It also puts all the random orphaned pages I&rsquo;ve created, like <a href="https://projects.kwon.nyc/internet-is-fun">The internet used to be fun</a>, in some context / information architecture. (&ldquo;Orphan&rdquo; is probably not very inclusive; if you have a better way to refer to them let me know. Although I supposed they&rsquo;re no longer orphaned now that they&rsquo;re on an index page.)</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://kwon.photos/">kwon.photos</a></strong>: The beginnings of a photo site, at a domain I bought a while ago and sat on because (inner dialogue incoming) I&rsquo;m not a photographer but still want to share things in the world around me that I notice and think are worth capturing but there are already too many photos online and nobody will care about mine and I don&rsquo;t even know how I would start to build a photo site these days, what is a WebP and an AVIF and what do you mean <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>, don&rsquo;t you mean <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> (end inner dialogue). Anywho, I also actually <a href="https://github.com/rjkwon/photos/blob/main/README.md">wrote documentation</a> for the first time ever (tryna look out for future me) since I am trying out a new stack including a totally different static site generator, Astro (on a tip from <a href="https://www.iamrob.in/">Robin</a> who used it to build his <a href="https://robins.photos/">cool photo site</a>), and a Node-based image processor, Sharp. (Back in my day, we had to manually make thumbnail images in Photoshop&hellip;)</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://kwon.nyc/cans/">kwon.nyc/cans</a></strong>: A sub-site with some neat-looking cans of craft beer I have had over the years. This one is an idea I had so long ago, that took me so long to execute on, that I don&rsquo;t even really drink beer that much anymore 😂 I still appreciate a cute can though.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Disclosure: I did (and do) use an AI chatbot to help me build websites, although I have pretty specific guidelines for how I use them and don&rsquo;t use them. I&rsquo;ll write more about my thoughts later but tl;dr I&rsquo;m not anti-chatbot, obviously, but I do think they are very specific tools that have very specific use cases (<strong>ASK:</strong> can you send me any AI disclosures you&rsquo;ve seen on personal sites, or if you have one on your own? I&rsquo;ve seen some good ones lately but of course forgotten to bookmark them).</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>A little while back (six months ago) I [wrote](https://kwon.nyc/notes/unfinished-but-shareable/) about how I made a random page featuring my [dad’s hats](https://kwon.nyc/dad-hats/) and how I want to make more evergreen content and share more photos and visual things here.

For some things in my life I have become very decisive but this website is not one of them. Lol. Maybe it’s because it’s one of my few creative practices that I do purely for fun and so I feel a lot of pressure to make it amazing.

In my work life, I have gotten fairly reliable at managing my own projects, and collaborating with other people who are managing their own. I have also taken a similar approach to life admin and organization; I am at the point in my life where managing my own health and finances are also projects that need to be managed and tracked; not because I am particularly un/healthy or un/wealthy, but more because when you’ve been around for a few decades there’s just more STUFF that you generate with regard to taking care of yourself.

Anyway, all that is fine, but I just… don’t necessarily want to feel like I’m project-managing a thing in my personal life something that’s supposed purely for fun, i.e., this website. And unfortunately that has translated to many ideas that seem exciting at first but then as soon as I’ve documented one and decided to try and execute on it, it languishes. I have also incurred quite a bit of technical debt on this website based on fleeting decisions I made years ago, which also makes me hesitate to just build something even if it’s not perfect.

The “personal website as digital garden” metaphor is one that many people have resonated with, and for good reason. “Working with the garage door open” is another one I like, especially because it unlocks some core memories of my suburban midwestern upbringing. And remember those “Under Construction” signs (gifs) we used to put on pages on our websites, before reverse-chronological blogging was a thing? I like that metaphor, too. At some point you just have to describe the thing and not use the metaphor as an entire allegory, though.

Well, the whole point of this was to share some things I have been gingerly working on lately – think of it as me working on the garden in my garage with the door open and a construction sign in the driveway :)

So anyway… I made these ( _throws them on the ground in front of you and runs away_):

1. **[index.kwon.nyc](https://index.kwon.nyc/)**: An index page, as a way to track updates and show the delta between what this site is today and all my grand plans for it – maybe they will materialize faster if I create some accountability for myself by publishing them there. Or maybe I’ll continue to think of fun ideas and then stare at my own belly button for months. It also puts all the random orphaned pages I’ve created, like [The internet used to be fun](https://projects.kwon.nyc/internet-is-fun), in some context / information architecture. (“Orphan” is probably not very inclusive; if you have a better way to refer to them let me know. Although I supposed they’re no longer orphaned now that they’re on an index page.)
2. **[kwon.photos](https://kwon.photos/)**: The beginnings of a photo site, at a domain I bought a while ago and sat on because (inner dialogue incoming) I’m not a photographer but still want to share things in the world around me that I notice and think are worth capturing but there are already too many photos online and nobody will care about mine and I don’t even know how I would start to build a photo site these days, what is a WebP and an AVIF and what do you mean `&#60;picture&#62;`, don’t you mean `&#60;img&#62;` (end inner dialogue). Anywho, I also actually [wrote documentation](https://github.com/rjkwon/photos/blob/main/README.md) for the first time ever (tryna look out for future me) since I am trying out a new stack including a totally different static site generator, Astro (on a tip from [Robin](https://www.iamrob.in/) who used it to build his [cool photo site](https://robins.photos/)), and a Node-based image processor, Sharp. (Back in my day, we had to manually make thumbnail images in Photoshop…)
3. **[kwon.nyc/cans](https://kwon.nyc/cans/)**: A sub-site with some neat-looking cans of craft beer I have had over the years. This one is an idea I had so long ago, that took me so long to execute on, that I don’t even really drink beer that much anymore 😂 I still appreciate a cute can though.

Disclosure: I did (and do) use an AI chatbot to help me build websites, although I have pretty specific guidelines for how I use them and don’t use them.

      <title>Don’t Forget These Tags to Make HTML Work Like You Expect</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/dont-forget-these-html-tags/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I was watching <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-10-24T2205" >Alex Petros’ talk</a> and he has a slide in there titled “Incantations that make HTML work correctly”.</p>
        <p>This got me thinking about the basic snippets of HTML I’ve learned to always include in order for my website to work as I expect in the browser — like “Hey I just made a <code>.html</code> file on disk and am going to open it in the browser. What should be in there?”</p>

      <source:markdown>I was watching [Alex Petros’ talk](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-10-24T2205) and he has a slide in there titled “Incantations that make HTML work correctly”.

This got me thinking about the basic snippets of HTML I’ve learned to always include in order for my website to work as I expect in the browser — like “Hey I just made a `.html` file on disk and am going to open it in the browser. What should be in there?”

This is what comes to mind:

```language html
&#60;!doctype html&#62;
&#60;html lang=&#34;en&#34;&#62;
&#60;meta charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&#62;
&#60;meta name=&#34;viewport&#34; content=&#34;width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0&#34;&#62;

```

Why each?

## doctype

```language html
&#60;!doctype html&#62;

```

Without `&#60;!doctype html&#62;`, browsers may switch to quirks mode, emulating legacy, pre-standards behavior. This will change how calculations work around layout, sizing, and alignment.

`&#60;!doctype html&#62;` is what you want for consistent rendering. Or `&#60;!DOCTYPE HTML&#62;` if you prefer writing markup like it’s 1998. Or even `&#60;!doCTypE HTml&#62;` if you eschew all societal norms. It’s case-insensitive so they’ll all work.

## html lang

```language html
&#60;html lang=&#34;en&#34;&#62;

```

Declare the document’s language. Browsers, search engines, assistive technologies, etc. can leverage it to:

- Get pronunciation and voice right for screen readers
- Improve indexing and translation accuracy
- Apply locale-specific tools (e.g. spell-checking)
- And more…

Omit it and things will _look_ ok, but lots of basic web-adjacent tools might get things wrong. Specifying it makes everything _around_ the HTML work better and more accurately, so I always try to remember to include it.

## meta utf-8

This piece of info can come back from the server as a header, e.g.

```language js
return new Response(
    &#34;&#60;!doctype html&#62;&#60;h1&#62;Hello world&#60;/h1&#62;&#34;,
    {
        status: 200,
        headers: { &#34;Content-Type&#34;: &#34;text/html; charset=utf-8&#34; },
    }
);

```

But I like to set it in my HTML, especially when I’m making files on disk I open manually in the browser.

```language html
&#60;meta charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&#62;

```

This tells the browser how to interpret text, ensuring characters like é, ü, and others display correctly.

So many times I’ve opened a document without this tag and things just don’t look right — like my [smart quotes](https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com).

For example: copy this snippet, stick it in an HTML file, and open it on your computer:

```language html
&#60;!doctype html&#62;
&#60;h1&#62;Without meta utf-8&#60;/h1&#62;
&#60;dl&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Smart quotes&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;“” and ‘’&#60;/dd&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Symbols&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;©, ™, ®, etc.&#60;/dd&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Ellipsis&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;…&#60;/dd&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Emojis&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;👍&#60;/dd&#62;
  &#60;dt&#62;Non-latin characters&#60;/dt&#62;
  &#60;dd&#62;é, ñ, etc.&#60;/dd&#62;
&#60;/dl&#62;

```

Things might look a bit wonky. But stick a `&#60;meta charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&#62;` tag in there and you’ll find some relief.

## Meta viewport

```language html
&#60;meta name=&#34;viewport&#34; content=&#34;width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0&#34;&#62;

```

Sometimes I’ll quickly prototype a little HTML and think, “Great it’s working as I expect!” Then I go open it on mobile and everything looks tiny — “\[Facepalm\] you forgot the meta viewport tag!”

Take a look at this screenshot, where I forgot the meta viewport tag on the left but included it on the right:

![Two screenshots of a basic HTML with an h1 tag that says “Hello world” that are side-by-side. The one on the left looks like it’s zoomed way out becuase it’s missing the meta viewport tag. The one on the right looks like you expect.](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/basic-html-quotes-meta-viewport-tags.png)

That ever happen to you? No, just me? Well anyway, it’s a good ‘un to include to make HTML work the way you expect.

## Last But Not Least…

I know what you’re thinking, I forgot the most important snippet of them all for writing HTML:

```language html
&#60;div id=&#34;root&#34;&#62;&#60;/div&#62;
&#60;script src=&#34;bundle.js&#34;&#62;&#60;/script&#62;

```

Lol.

        <![CDATA[<p>I had a very pleasant experience last week while I was reading through the RSS feeds I’m subscribed to. I came across two blog posts that were responding to blog posts of my own.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/clarity/">Robin Sloan wrote a post clarifying his position</a> after I linked to him in <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22177">my post about the slipperiness of the term “AI”</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Then <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/research-alt/">Jim Nielsen wrote a deliciously satirical piece</a> in response to <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22183">my pithy little parable about research</a>.</p>
        
        <p>I love it when this happens!</p>
        
        <p>Elizabeth Spiers recently wrote a piece called <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/tpm-25/what-made-blogging-different"><cite>What Made Blogging Different?</cite></a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>

      <source:markdown>I had a very pleasant experience last week while I was reading through the RSS feeds I’m subscribed to. I came across two blog posts that were responding to blog posts of my own.

[Robin Sloan wrote a post clarifying his position](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/clarity/) after I linked to him in [my post about the slipperiness of the term “AI”](https://adactio.com/journal/22177).

Then [Jim Nielsen wrote a deliciously satirical piece](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/research-alt/) in response to [my pithy little parable about research](https://adactio.com/journal/22183).

I love it when this happens!

Elizabeth Spiers recently wrote a piece called [What Made Blogging Different?](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/tpm-25/what-made-blogging-different):

&#62; And if they wanted to respond to you, they had to do it on their own blog, and link back. The effect of this was that there were few equivalents of the worst aspects of social media that broke through.

It’s so true. I feel like a response from someone’s own website is exponentially more valuable than a response on Bluesky, Mastodon, Instagram, or any other social media platform.

Don’t get me wrong: I absolutely love the way that [Brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) will send those social-media responses right back here to my own site in the form of [webmentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention). It also pings me whenever someone likes or shares a post of mine. But I’ve noticed that I’m not that interested in those anymore.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-house-of-dynamite/">House of Dynamite</a> is a fantastic movie, it deserved the great reviews it's getting, and I found it easy to watch, though a lot of reviewers said it wasn't. It's exactly the kind of movie I like -- political thriller with ideas rich with intrigue. Great acting and writing. It's the 2025 version of Fail Safe. Both are like stage play, but this one examines the story from all angles, very skillfully, so the story is told iteratively. </p>
        <p>The president in this story is throughtful and deliberative with no time to think. </p>
        <p>It's provocative because the person who would make that choice <i>now</i> just destroyed part of the most famous building in the country on a whim, presumably to show us he has the power to destroy things, which you will not doubt even slightly when you watch House of Dynamite. </p>
        <p>As you watch the movie, hold the thought in the back of your mind. What would Trump do. There was a time when we chose presidents based on our willingness them to have them decide whether or not to launch the nukes. We lost that perspective, but the problem never went away. </p>]]>

The president in this story is throughtful and deliberative with no time to think.

It&#39;s provocative because the person who would make that choice _now_ just destroyed part of the most famous building in the country on a whim, presumably to show us he has the power to destroy things, which you will not doubt even slightly when you watch House of Dynamite.

As you watch the movie, hold the thought in the back of your mind. What would Trump do. There was a time when we chose presidents based on our willingness them to have them decide whether or not to launch the nukes. We lost that perspective, but the problem never went away.</source:markdown>

      <title>Setting up a codebase for working with coding agents</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/25/coding-agent-tips/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Someone on Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45695621#45704966">asked for tips</a> on setting up a codebase to be more productive with AI coding tools. Here's my reply:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Good automated tests which the coding agent can run. I love pytest for this - one of my projects has 1500 tests and Claude Code is really good at selectively executing just tests relevant to the change it is making, and then running the whole suite at the end.</li>
        <li>Give them the ability to interactively test the code they are writing too. Notes on how to start a development server (for web projects) are useful, then you can have them use Playwright or curl to try things out.</li>
        <li>I'm having great results from maintaining a GitHub issues collection for projects and pasting URLs to issues directly into Claude Code.</li>
        <li>I actually don't think documentation is too important: LLMs can read the code a lot faster than you to figure out how to use it. I have comprehensive documentation across all of my projects but I don't think it's that helpful for the coding agents, though they are good at helping me spot if it needs updating.</li>
        <li>Linters, type checkers, auto-formatters - give coding agents helpful tools to run and they'll use them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the most part anything that makes a codebase easier for humans to maintain turns out to help agents as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: Thought of another one: detailed error messages! If a manual or automated test fails the more information you can return back to the model the better, and stuffing extra data in the error message or assertion is a very inexpensive way to do that.</p>

**Update**: Thought of another one: detailed error messages! If a manual or automated test fails the more information you can return back to the model the better, and stuffing extra data in the error message or assertion is a very inexpensive way to do that.

      <title>Manhattan Plot of Manhattan</title>
      <link>https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/25/manhattan-plot-of-manhattan/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<figure class="full-width"><a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/25/manhattan-plot-of-manhattan/skyline-plot.png" data-fancybox>
            <img src="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/25/manhattan-plot-of-manhattan/skyline-plot.png"
                 alt="Skyline plot"/></a><figcaption>
                    <p>Here I continue my efforts to design visualizations that are as poorly-suited as possible to being displayed on phones. It looks pretty good on a big monitor, or six feet wide on a wall.</p>
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I made a version of this plot a few years ago. I ended up revisiting it this morning  because I&rsquo;m updating various datasets and code. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot">Manhattan
        plot</a> is a term sometimes used to describe a kind of scatter plot where the x-values are fairly continuous, and
        the y values have distributions with long tails, so the plot looks like a skyline. This one here is a bar chart rather than a scatter plot but it&rsquo;s still a kind of Manhattan plot of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The plot shows the heights of almost all currently-existing buildings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in Manhattan (on the y-axis) by their year of construction on the x-axis. What I want is a plot that gives a sense of the distribution of building heights over time. To make the plot work I play a few tricks. First, the resolution of the x-axis is only to the year,which would result in way too much overplotting. (We have almost 35,000 buildings to draw.) So we add a small amount of random noise to the x-values, which makes buildings distribute themselves around their year of construction. There&rsquo;s still overplotting, but now it works in our favor. It contributes to a feeling of building density.</p>
        <p>Second, there are so many buildings that we can&rsquo;t plot everything as solid, filled rectangle. Instead, we make make the outlines of each rectangle a very thin white line, so everything looks like a vector-driven video game from 1981. Then we make a variable that bins buildings by height into ten categories, one for every hundred feet of additional roof height. We map that to fill color of the rectangles (darker purples for shorter buildings through bright yellow for taller ones), which means the taller a building the brighter it looks. But again, we can&rsquo;t just plot those as solid colors. So we also take the roof heights and rescale them to a range of 0.4 to 0.85. Then we map <em>that</em> number directly to the alpha channel of the fill color. So taller buildings are not only brighter in color, they are more opaque. Alpha runs from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). The specific values of 0.4 to 0.85 are just from trial and error. We want the taller buildings to stand out, and because there are fewer of them they need to be more opaque. Whereas the fills of many more shorter buildings will overlap, so they can be individually more transparent.</p>
        <p>You can really see the recent rise of supertall fancy apartment buildings in Manhattan in the last ten years or so&mdash;buildings like the curséd <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/111_West_57th_Street">111 West 57th</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53W53">53 West 53rd</a>. The cursédness 111 W57th extends to dataset:</p>

      <source:markdown>[![Skyline plot](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/25/manhattan-plot-of-manhattan/skyline-plot.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/25/manhattan-plot-of-manhattan/skyline-plot.png)

Here I continue my efforts to design visualizations that are as poorly-suited as possible to being displayed on phones. It looks pretty good on a big monitor, or six feet wide on a wall.

I made a version of this plot a few years ago. I ended up revisiting it this morning because I’m updating various datasets and code. A [Manhattan\
plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot) is a term sometimes used to describe a kind of scatter plot where the x-values are fairly continuous, and
the y values have distributions with long tails, so the plot looks like a skyline. This one here is a bar chart rather than a scatter plot but it’s still a kind of Manhattan plot of Manhattan.

The plot shows the heights of almost all currently-existing buildings[1](#fn:1) in Manhattan (on the y-axis) by their year of construction on the x-axis. What I want is a plot that gives a sense of the distribution of building heights over time. To make the plot work I play a few tricks. First, the resolution of the x-axis is only to the year,which would result in way too much overplotting. (We have almost 35,000 buildings to draw.) So we add a small amount of random noise to the x-values, which makes buildings distribute themselves around their year of construction. There’s still overplotting, but now it works in our favor. It contributes to a feeling of building density.

Second, there are so many buildings that we can’t plot everything as solid, filled rectangle. Instead, we make make the outlines of each rectangle a very thin white line, so everything looks like a vector-driven video game from 1981. Then we make a variable that bins buildings by height into ten categories, one for every hundred feet of additional roof height. We map that to fill color of the rectangles (darker purples for shorter buildings through bright yellow for taller ones), which means the taller a building the brighter it looks. But again, we can’t just plot those as solid colors. So we also take the roof heights and rescale them to a range of 0.4 to 0.85. Then we map _that_ number directly to the alpha channel of the fill color. So taller buildings are not only brighter in color, they are more opaque. Alpha runs from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). The specific values of 0.4 to 0.85 are just from trial and error. We want the taller buildings to stand out, and because there are fewer of them they need to be more opaque. Whereas the fills of many more shorter buildings will overlap, so they can be individually more transparent.

You can really see the recent rise of supertall fancy apartment buildings in Manhattan in the last ten years or so—buildings like the curséd [111 West 57th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/111_West_57th_Street) and
[53 West 53rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53W53). The cursédness 111 W57th extends to dataset:

It’s recorded as having been completed in 1924, instead of 2019. Why? There’s a hint in the `lststatype` column, which says “Merged”. Technically the building took over and “renovated” Steinway Hall, which _was_ built in 1924. There are a few cases like this in the dataset for buildings that are going to be salient in the figure—i.e. very tall ones. There’s also some missing data, with eight buildings over 600 feet tall where the construction year is not available. At least two of those are because the building was still under construction when the data were recorded. As always, 90% of data analysis is data cleaning.

      <source:markdown>The illusion that Europe had better democratic processes and laws was shattered by their unequivocal support of the genocide in Palestine.

I used to nod vigorously when a righteous European politician made progressive statements. But it turns out, it was just the tool they reached out for to advance their crass goals.

An inch more tasteful than Trump, but Trumpian at their core.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>I see that the [WordPress world](https://wordpress.org/news/2025/05/announcing-the-formation-of-the-wordpress-ai-team/) is getting interested in adding AI features. I had some [ideas](http://scripting.com/2024/09/28/132152.html) a [few](http://scripting.com/2025/07/12/134525.html) [years](http://scripting.com/2025/03/20/151234.html) [ago](http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html), about how I would like AI to be hooked up to blogging, and the ideas have developed a bit in the years since.

As a writer I want most is every bit of writing I’ve published turned into any kind of book I want at any time.

An example of a book lurking in the archive of my blog.

_A user’s guide to FeedLand._

Knowing the AI would pull a users manual together on command, I’d feel more comfortable writing about it on my blog. As it is there’s a lot of good info between other blog posts.

I think it’s a great time to invest in new ideas for writers.

I have pretty good search on my blog, but so much more is possible.

Imagine a series of book types you could ask your AI friend to build for you from your own writing.

Eventually all user&#39;s guides will be assembled by AI. In the case of software products it should have already happened, though I&#39;m just as behind the curve as everyone else is in this regard.

And of course the first docs to be produced that way would be _A user&#39;s guide to WordPress._</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[<p>
        I recently finished <a
        href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/at-work-in-the-ruins/">At
        Work in the Ruins</a> by <a href="https://dougald.nu/">Dougald Hine</a>
        (co-author of the <a
        href="https://inkdroid.org/2025/06/05/dark-mountain/">The Dark Mountain
        Manifesto</a>). I aim to re-read it after it has sunk in a bit more. The
        arc of the book reminds me a bit of Bruno Latour’s thinking, in that it
        seems to make the axis of left/right political debates more two (or
        three) dimensional. In part, the book reflects on what we can learn from
        the response to the COVID19 pandemic, when thinking about climate
        change, and the unsustainable/extractive economies and ways of living in
        the west. I found some of the ideas challenging at first, but once I
        went through it, I found I wanted to return to the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
        The book concludes with four ways of working in the ruins, which I
        wanted to note here mostly as a reminder to myself:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
        The first kind of work that makes sense is to salvage the good that may
        be taken with us from the ruins of the world that is ending. Among the
        tangled legacies of modernity, there are gifts that we would not gladly
        leave behind, so this is the attempt to bring with us what we are able
        to carry.
        </p>
        <p>
        The second kind of work is to mourn the good that cannot be taken with
        us. There is no need to settle where the boundary lies between what can
        be saved and what is to be mourned; you may answer that question
        differently to me and only time will tell which of us was right, but
        this still leaves us with work to do in the meanwhile. Part of the work
        of mourning is to tell the stories of the good things that couldn’t be
        saved, for those stories can be taken with us and they may turn out to
        be seeds.
        </p>
        <p>
        The third kind of work involves discernment: notice the things within
        our ways of living that were never as good as we told ourselves they
        were and the chance we are being given to walk away from these. It is
        the strange gift of a time of endings to bring into view the gap between
        the things we are trying to do and the ways we went about doing them
        around here lately. Make use of this gift.
        </p>
        <p>
        The fourth kind of work is to look for the dropped threads, the moments
        earlier in the story that have something to tell us. The way of life
        that is ending had a beginning, and other ways were ending in that
        moment or being pushed to the edges. So look for the skills or practices
        or knowledges that have been marked as extinct and obsolete, for some of
        these may yet make all the difference. There is no going back - but
        there are dropped threads that can be woven into the onward story.
        </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        These strategies remind me quite a bit of the praxis of <a
        href="https://inkdroid.org/2025/08/23/permacomputing/">permacomputing</a>–determining
        what parts of the computing project can be useful to preserve, and what
        to let go of. I also identify with the fourth kind of work. As I’ve
        gotten older I’ve noticed that I gravitate towards finding value in how
        older ideas, that may have fallen out of fashion or come under
        criticism, have relevance and utility in the present, especially because
        of the way we can learn from the particular ways that they failed, or
        fell short.

      <source:markdown>**[Visual Features Across Modalities: SVG and ASCII Art Reveal Cross-Modal Understanding](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/october-update/index.html#svg-cross-modal)**

New model interpretability research from Anthropic, this time focused on SVG and ASCII art generation.

&#62; We found that the same feature that activates over the eyes in an ASCII face also activates for eyes across diverse text-based modalities, including SVG code and prose in various languages. This is not limited to eyes – we found a number of cross-modal features that recognize specific concepts: from small components like mouths and ears within ASCII or SVG faces, to full visual depictions like dogs and cats. \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; These features depend on the surrounding context within the visual depiction. For instance, an SVG circle element activates “eye” features only when positioned within a larger structure that activates “face” features.

And really, I can&#39;t _not_ link to this one given the bonus they tagged on at the end!

&#62; As a bonus, we also inspected features for an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle, [first popularized](https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle) [by Simon Willison](https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle) as a way to test a model&#39;s artistic capabilities. We find features representing concepts including &#34;bike&#34;, &#34;wheels&#34;, &#34;feet&#34;, &#34;tail&#34;, &#34;eyes&#34;, and &#34;mouth&#34; activating over the corresponding parts of the SVG code.

        Something I'm enjoying about Claude Code is that any time you ask it questions about <em>itself</em> it runs tool calls like these:</p>
        <p><img alt="I'll check the Claude Code documentation about bash hooks to see if there's something about the   configuration that might explain why it didn't trigger.

The bashHook in your settings.json is checking the $PROMPT variable, but   according to the documentation, bash hooks should:    1. Use PreToolUse hooks (not a simple bash script)   2. Parse JSON input from stdin   3. Access the command via tool_input.command in the JSON " src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-self-documentation.jpg" /></p>
        <p>In this case I'd asked it about its "hooks" feature.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude_code_docs_map.md">claude_code_docs_map.md</a> file is a neat Markdown index of all of their other documentation - the same pattern advocated by <a href="https://llmstxt.org/">llms.txt</a>.

        <p>I intercepted the current Claude Code system prompt <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/2/claude-trace/">using this trick</a> and sure enough it included a note about this URL:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>When the user directly asks about Claude Code (eg. "can Claude Code do...", "does Claude Code have..."), or asks in second person (eg. "are you able...", "can you do..."), or asks how to use a specific Claude Code feature (eg. implement a hook, or write a slash command), use the WebFetch tool to gather information to answer the question from Claude Code docs. The list of available docs is available at https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude_code_docs_map.md.</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I wish other LLM products - including both ChatGPT and Claude.ai themselves - would implement a similar pattern. It's infuriating how bad LLM tools are at answering questions about themselves, though unsurprising given that their model's training data pre-dates the latest version of those tools.

        <![CDATA[<p>We've had a performance issue in FeedLand that we finally think we have tracked down. I'm working slowly and carefully on a new version with the new thinking. If it works, I'll tell you more about what worked and how it affects the software, obviously for the better. </p>
        <p>What's notable about this fix is that it came about when I was talking with people who work on the open source WordPress project at the WordCamp last week in Ottawa. One of them took an interest and puzzled it out and came up with a theory. When we tested the theory on the real data, it made a big difference. If it works in the deployed version as well as it did in the test, FeedLand will be better for this. </p>
        <p>Related, I've been asked if we'll share the subscription list for the WordPress News site, so this gives me a chance to show that any FeedLand-managed site, by default has a white-on-orange <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/24/wordpressNewsScreen.png">XML icon</a>. When you click on it, you'll see the <a href="https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=wordpress">OPML list</a> for the page you were looking at. The list is dynamic, so it changes whenever the set of feeds changes. This has become a huge part of the systems we've built with FeedLand, that's why you see apps that are deployed on one server using data from a different one. The federation protocol for FeedLand is a simple and well-established standard for sharing lists of feeds, OPML over HTTP. Kind of like RSS was when we were just getting started with feeds, it's how you plug systems together. Esp if you can take advantage of the fact they're all dynamic. Also that they work really well with categories. Lots to say about FeedLand. Glad we're turning this corner now. </p>

Now it’s my turn.

Last week I’m flying home.

My flight gets delayed in air, then lands late so I miss my connecting flight…

\[Skip over all the stuff about airline customer support, getting rebooked, etc.\]

It’s ~10pm and I’m stranded overnight. I need a last-minute hotel room.

I figure I’ll try HotelTonight because that’s their shtick, right? “Incredible last-minute hotel deals” says their homepage hero banner.

I find the closest hotel, click “Purchase” it takes me to checkout, I do the whole Apple Pay thing, then it says “failed to book” because there are no more rooms left.

Ok? Would’ve been nice to know that _before_ going through all the checkout stuff, but ok. I’ll find another.

Two more hotels, same deal. Click through, checkout, blah blah blah, payment won’t go through. It says there are no more rooms left.

No I’m getting frustrated. I’ll try one more time…

Same flow. Finally! Payment goes through. Confirmation number and all — I’m good to go!

I leave the airport and get a rideshare to the hotel.

Go up to the desk. “Yes, I’m checking in please.” They ask for my name. I give it.

They can’t find me.

“Oh, no…” I think.

“Do you have a reservation number?”

Hell yes I do! Right here in the email HotelTonight sent me.

I give it to them.

It’s not in their system.

“Ok well, can you get me a room?”

Nope, they are completely full for the night.

Knowing that I booked through a third-party system, and it’s not in the first-party system, I know there’s no chance I’m getting a room.

So now it’s 10:30pm. I’m in the lobby of the hotel for which I have a bogus confirmation and I begin my search for the next-closest hotel.

I know at this point I’m not using anything internet-based to make a reservation. Over-the-phone only!

I just need to connect to a human at a front desk.

I call maybe 12 hotels. About two give me humans at the front desk. Both of those are booked solid for the night.

But you know what? Props to those hotels for having direct lines to a human. _YUGE_ props.

A direct line to a human feels like the ultimate luxury at this point.

        <![CDATA[<h3><em>For October 14-21, 2025</em></h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome to <strong>A Newsletter of Humorous Writing</strong>, a roundup of the week's finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Sorry this week’s edition is arriving a little bit late today! We got caught up in an “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie” situation, but instead of a cookie it was bagels, and instead of a mouse it was a particularly large and angry pigeon, and instead of “give” it was—look what we’re trying to say is we spent all day chasing around the pigeon that stole our breakfast.</p>
        <hr/><h2>What We Enjoyed This Week</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/i-am-legally-obligated-to-play-billy-joels-river-of-dreams-at-least-once-during-your-dental-appointment?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>I Am Legally Obligated to Play Billy Joel’s “River of Dreams” at Least Once During Your Dental Appointment</strong></a><strong> by </strong><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/worldofktebs.bsky.social?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Katie Mazza-Phillips</strong></a> <em>(McSweeney’s)</em> Katie starts with an interesting observation (“What’s up with the music they play in dentists’ offices?”) and spins it into a terrific piece by making nice specific choices (Billy Joel’s “River of Dreams”) and by simply exploring the logic and logistics of her premise. (“Billy Joel’s people call every Saturday to ask your receptionist how many times you played ‘The River of Dreams’ in the office that week.”)</p>
        <p>This instantly joins the pantheon of great humor pieces about Billy Joel. It’s an illustrious list that includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ian_Black?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Ian Black</a>’s <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/what-i-would-be-thinking-about-if-i-were-billy-joel-driving-toward-a-holiday-party-where-i-knew-there-was-going-to-be-a-piano?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">What I Would Be Thinking About If I Were Billy Joel Driving Toward a Holiday Party Where I Knew There Was Going to Be a Piano</a> and <a href="https://www.felipetorresmedina.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Felipe Torres Medina</a> and <a href="https://drujohnston.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dru Johnston</a>’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/beware-the-piano-man?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Beware the Piano-Man!</a> And for some great non-fiction about Billy Joel that is also often quite funny, check out <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/nick-paumgarten?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nick Paumgarten</a>’s profile, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/billy-joel-profile-thirty-three-hit-wonder?utm_source=humorouswriting&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder</a>.</p>

      <source:markdown>### _For October 14-21, 2025_

Hello and welcome to **A Newsletter of Humorous Writing**, a roundup of the week&#39;s finest short humor pieces and funny articles, and a celebration of the fantastic writers who wrote them. Sorry this week’s edition is arriving a little bit late today! We got caught up in an “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie” situation, but instead of a cookie it was bagels, and instead of a mouse it was a particularly large and angry pigeon, and instead of “give” it was—look what we’re trying to say is we spent all day chasing around the pigeon that stole our breakfast.

## What We Enjoyed This Week

[**I Am Legally Obligated to Play Billy Joel’s “River of Dreams” at Least Once During Your Dental Appointment**](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/i-am-legally-obligated-to-play-billy-joels-river-of-dreams-at-least-once-during-your-dental-appointment?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) **by** [**Katie Mazza-Phillips**](https://bsky.app/profile/worldofktebs.bsky.social?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) _(McSweeney’s)_ Katie starts with an interesting observation (“What’s up with the music they play in dentists’ offices?”) and spins it into a terrific piece by making nice specific choices (Billy Joel’s “River of Dreams”) and by simply exploring the logic and logistics of her premise. (“Billy Joel’s people call every Saturday to ask your receptionist how many times you played ‘The River of Dreams’ in the office that week.”)

This instantly joins the pantheon of great humor pieces about Billy Joel. It’s an illustrious list that includes [Michael Ian Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ian_Black?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415)’s [What I Would Be Thinking About If I Were Billy Joel Driving Toward a Holiday Party Where I Knew There Was Going to Be a Piano](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/what-i-would-be-thinking-about-if-i-were-billy-joel-driving-toward-a-holiday-party-where-i-knew-there-was-going-to-be-a-piano?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) and [Felipe Torres Medina](https://www.felipetorresmedina.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) and [Dru Johnston](https://drujohnston.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415)’s [Beware the Piano-Man!](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/beware-the-piano-man?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) And for some great non-fiction about Billy Joel that is also often quite funny, check out [Nick Paumgarten](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/nick-paumgarten?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415)’s profile, [Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/billy-joel-profile-thirty-three-hit-wonder?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415).

[**So, You and the Pope Both Showed Up to This Party Wearing the Same Hat**](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/so-you-and-the-pope-both-showed-up-to-this-party-wearing-the-same-hat?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) **by** [**Tyler Gooch**](https://tylergoo.ch/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) _(McSweeney’s)_ This absurd situation is such a funny setup, and Tyler does a tremendous job exploring and heightening that situation as the piece goes on. This one goes to some truly unexpected places, but all the heightening is completely earned.

[**Quiz: How much of a real New Yorker are you?**](https://nygroove.nyc/real-new-yorker-quiz/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) **by** [**New York Groove Staff**](https://nygroove.nyc/about/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) _(The New York Groove)_ This isn’t just a delightfully wacky quiz packed with fun New York City specifics, it’s also a spot-on satire of New Yorkers’ tendency to try to one-up each other about who’s got more of a connection to the city. Oh, you live in New York but have never one-upped someone else about who’s more of a real New Yorker? I guess you’re not a… well…

## An Old Favorite

[**How to Kiss Someone Even Though That’s Gross**](https://reductress.com/post/how-to-kiss-someone-even-though-thats-gross/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) **by** [**Freddie Shanel**](https://www.freddieshanel.com/?utm_source=humorouswriting&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_campaign=a-newsletter-of-humorous-writing-415) _(Reductress)_ This is just an all-timer of a headline. Sometimes the headline or title of a piece is so good that the actual content can’t possibly live up to it, but that is absolutely not the case here. This one is filled with great lines.

      <title>AI Browsers: Living on the Frontier of Security</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/ai-browsers-frontier-security/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI released their new <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-10-22T1238" >“browser”</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/" >Simon Willison has the deets on its security</a>, going point-by-point through the statement from OpenAI’s Chief Information Security Officer. His post is great if you want to dive on the details. Here’s my high-level takeaway:</p>
        <p>Everything OpenAI <em>says</em> they are doing to mitigate the security concerns of an LLM paired with a browser sounds reasonable in theory. However, as their CISO says, “prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem”. So unless you want to be part of what is essentially a global experiment on the frontier of security on the internet, you might want to wait before you consider any of their promises “meaningful mitigation”.</p>
        <p>(Aside: Let’s put people on the “frontier” of security for their daily tasks, that seems totally fine right?

        </ol>
        <p>This intersection seems <em>primed</em> for exploitation, especially if you consider combining different techniques we’ve seen as of late like <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/weaponizing-ai-coding-agents-for-malware-in-the-nx-malicious-package/" >weaponizing LLM agents</a> and <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/npm-risks/" >shipping malicious code that only runs in end-users’ browsers</a>.</p>
        <p>Imagine, for a second, something like the following:</p>
        <p>You’re an attacker and you stick malicious instructions — not code, mind you, just plain-text English language prose — in your otherwise helpful lib and let people install it.</p>

        <p>Bundlers then combine third-party dependencies with first-party code in order to spit it out application code which gets shipped to end users.</p>
        <p>At this point, there is still zero malicious code that has executed on anyone’s computer.</p>
        <p>Then, end users w/AI browsers end up consuming these plain-text instructions that are part of your application bundle and boom, you’ve been exploited.</p>
        <p>At no point was any “malicious code” written by a bad actor “executed” by the browser engine itself. Rather, it’s the bolted on AI agent running alongside the browser engine that ingests these instructions and does something it obviously shouldn’t.</p>

      <source:markdown>OpenAI released their new [“browser”](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-10-22T1238) and [Simon Willison has the deets on its security](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/), going point-by-point through the statement from OpenAI’s Chief Information Security Officer. His post is great if you want to dive on the details. Here’s my high-level takeaway:

Everything OpenAI _says_ they are doing to mitigate the security concerns of an LLM paired with a browser sounds reasonable in theory. However, as their CISO says, “prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem”. So unless you want to be part of what is essentially a global experiment on the frontier of security on the internet, you might want to wait before you consider any of their promises “meaningful mitigation”.

(Aside: Let’s put people on the “frontier” of security for their daily tasks, that seems totally fine right? Meanwhile, Tom MacWright has rationally argued that [putting an AI chatbot between users and the internet is an obvious disaster we’ll all recognize as such one day](https://macwright.com/2025/05/29/putting-an-untrusted-chat-layer-is-a-disaster).)

What really strikes me after reading Simon’s article is the intersection of these two topics which have garnered a lot of attention as of late:

1. npm supply chain attacks
2. AI browsers

This intersection seems _primed_ for exploitation, especially if you consider combining different techniques we’ve seen as of late like [weaponizing LLM agents](https://snyk.io/blog/weaponizing-ai-coding-agents-for-malware-in-the-nx-malicious-package/) and [shipping malicious code that only runs in end-users’ browsers](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/npm-risks/).

Imagine, for a second, something like the following:

You’re an attacker and you stick malicious instructions — not code, mind you, just plain-text English language prose — in your otherwise helpful lib and let people install it.

No malicious code is run on the installing computer.

Bundlers then combine third-party dependencies with first-party code in order to spit it out application code which gets shipped to end users.

At this point, there is still zero malicious code that has executed on anyone’s computer.

Then, end users w/AI browsers end up consuming these plain-text instructions that are part of your application bundle and boom, you’ve been exploited.

At no point was any “malicious code” written by a bad actor “executed” by the browser engine itself. Rather, it’s the bolted on AI agent running alongside the browser engine that ingests these instructions and does something it obviously shouldn’t.

In other words: it doesn’t have to be code to be an exploit. Plain-text human language is now a weaponizable exploit, which means the surface for attacks just got way bigger.

But probably don’t listen to me. I’m not a security expert. However, every day that voice in the back of my head to pivot to security gets louder and louder, as it’s seemingly [the only part of computer science that gets worse every year](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-05-24T1337).

This is a relief:

&#62; Federal judge Ona T. Wang filed a new order on October 9 that frees OpenAI of an obligation to &#34;preserve and segregate all output log data that would otherwise be deleted on a going forward basis.&#34;

I wrote about this [in June](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/5/openai-court-order/). OpenAI were compelled by a court order to preserve _all_ output, even from private chats, in case it became relevant to the ongoing New York Times lawsuit.

Here are those &#34;some exceptions&#34;:

&#62; The judge in the case said that any chat logs already saved under the previous order would still be accessible and that OpenAI is required to hold on to any data related to ChatGPT accounts that have been flagged by the NYT.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I was manually converting a terminal session into a shared HTML file for the umpteenth time when I decided to reduce the friction by building a custom tool for it - and on the spur of the moment I fired up <a href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a> to record the process. The result is this new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQvMLLrFPVI">11 minute YouTube video</a> showing my workflow for vibe-coding simple tools from start to finish.</p>

        > </lite-youtube></p>
        <h4 id="the-initial-problem">The initial problem</h4>
        <p>The problem I wanted to solve involves sharing my Claude Code CLI sessions - and the more general problem of sharing interesting things that happen in my terminal.</p>
        <p>A while back I discovered (using my vibe-coded <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/clipboard-viewer">clipboard inspector</a>) that copying and pasting from the macOS terminal populates a rich text clipboard format which preserves the colors and general formatting of the terminal output.</p>
        <p>The problem is that format looks like this:</p>
        <pre><code>{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2859
        \cocoatextscaling0\cocoaplatform0{\fonttbl\f0\fnil\fcharset0 Monaco;}
        {\colortbl;\red255\green255\blue255;\red242\green242\blue242;\red0\green0\blue0;\red204\green98\blue70;
        \red0\green0\blue0;\red97\green97\blue97;\red102\green102\blue102;\red255\
        </code></pre>
        <p>This struck me as the kind of thing an LLM might be able to write code to parse, so I had <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/680801ad-0804-8006-83fc-c2b209841a9c">ChatGPT take a crack at it</a> and then later <a href="https://claude.ai/share/5c12dd0e-713d-4f32-a6c1-d05dee353e4d">rewrote it from scratch with Claude Sonnet 4.5</a>. The result was <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html">this rtf-to-html tool</a> which lets you paste in rich formatted text and gives you reasonably solid HTML that you can share elsewhere.</p>
        <p>To share that HTML I've started habitually pasting it into a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gist</a> and then taking advantage of <code>gitpreview.github.io</code>, a neat little unofficial tool that accepts <code>?GIST_ID</code> and displays the gist content as a standalone HTML page... which means you can link to rendered HTML that's stored in a gist.</p>
        <p>So my process was:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Copy terminal output</li>
        <li>Paste into <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html">rtf-to-html</a>
        </li>
        <li>Copy resulting HTML</li>
        <li>Paste that int a new GitHub Gist</li>
        <li>Grab that Gist's ID</li>
        <li>Share the link to <code>gitpreview.github.io?GIST_ID</code>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Not too much hassle, but frustratingly manual if you're doing it several times a day.</p>
        <h4 id="the-desired-solution">The desired solution</h4>
        <p>Ideally I want a tool where I can do this:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Copy terminal output</li>
        <li>Paste into a new tool</li>
        <li>Click a button and get a <code>gistpreview</code> link to share</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I decided to get Claude Code for web to build the entire thing.</p>
        <h4 id="the-prompt">The prompt</h4>
        <p>Here's the full prompt I used on <a href="https://claude.ai/code">claude.ai/code</a>, pointed at my <code>simonw/tools</code> repo, to build the tool:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><code>Build a new tool called terminal-to-html which lets the user copy RTF directly from their terminal and paste it into a paste area, it then produces the HTML version of that in a textarea with a copy button, below is a button that says "Save this to a Gist", and below that is a full preview. It will be very similar to the existing rtf-to-html.html tool but it doesn't show the raw RTF and it has that Save this to a Gist button</code></p>
        <p><code>That button should do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does, with the same use of localStorage and the same flow to get users signed in with a token if they are not already</code></p>
        <p><code>So click the button, it asks the user to sign in if necessary, then it saves that HTML to a Gist in a file called index.html, gets back the Gist ID and shows the user the URL https://gistpreview.github.io/?6d778a8f9c4c2c005a189ff308c3bc47 - but with their gist ID in it</code></p>
        <p><code>They can see the URL, they can click it (do not use target="_blank") and there is also a "Copy URL" button to copy it to their clipboard</code></p>
        <p><code>Make the UI mobile friendly but also have it be courier green-text-on-black themed to reflect what it does</code></p>
        <p><code>If the user pastes and the pasted data is available as HTML but not as RTF skip the RTF step and process the HTML directly</code></p>
        <p><code>If the user pastes and it's only available as plain text then generate HTML that is just an open &lt;pre&gt; tag and their text and a closing &lt;/pre&gt; tag</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's quite a long prompt - it took me several minutes to type! But it covered the functionality I wanted in enough detail that I was pretty confident Claude would be able to build it.</p>
        <h4 id="combining">Combining previous tools</h4>
        <p>I'm using one key technique in this prompt: I'm referencing existing tools in the same repo and telling Claude to imitate their functionality.</p>
        <p>I first wrote about this trick last March in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser</a>, where I described how a snippet of code that used PDF.js and another snippet that used Tesseract.js was enough for Claude 3 Opus to build me this <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr">working PDF OCR tool</a>. That was actually the tool that kicked off my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> collection in the first place, which has since grown to 139 and counting.</p>
        <p>Here I'm telling Claude that I want the RTF to HTML functionality of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/rtf-to-html.html">rtf-to-html.html</a> combined with the Gist saving functionality of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/openai-audio-output.html">openai-audio-output.html</a>.</p>
        <p>That one has quite a bit going on. It uses the OpenAI audio API to generate audio output from a text prompt, which is returned by that API as base64-encoded data in JSON.</p>
        <p>Then it offers the user a button to save that JSON to a Gist, which gives the snippet a URL.</p>
        <p>Another tool I wrote, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/gpt-4o-audio-player.html">gpt-4o-audio-player.html</a>, can then accept that Gist ID in the URL and will fetch the JSON data and make the audio playable in the browser. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/gpt-4o-audio-player?gist=4a982d3fe7ba8cb4c01e89c69a4a5335">Here's an example</a>.</p>
        <p>The trickiest part of this is API tokens. I've built tools in the past that require users to paste in a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) (which I then store in <code>localStorage</code> in their browser - I don't want other people's authentication credentials anywhere near my own servers). But that's a bit fiddly.</p>
        <p>Instead, I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/975b8934066417fe771561a1b672ad4f">figured out</a> the minimal Cloudflare worker necessary to implement the server-side portion of GitHub's authentication flow. That code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/cloudflare-workers/github-auth.js">lives here</a> and means that any of the HTML+JavaScript tools in my collection can implement a GitHub authentication flow if they need to save Gists.</p>
        <p>But I don't have to tell the model any of that! I can just say "do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does" and Claude Code will work the rest out for itself.</p>
        <h4 id="the-result">The result</h4>
        <p>Here's what <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html">the resulting app</a> looks like after I've pasted in some terminal output from Claude Code CLI:</p>

      <source:markdown>This afternoon I was manually converting a terminal session into a shared HTML file for the umpteenth time when I decided to reduce the friction by building a custom tool for it - and on the spur of the moment I fired up [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) to record the process. The result is this new [11 minute YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQvMLLrFPVI) showing my workflow for vibe-coding simple tools from start to finish.

#### The initial problem

The problem I wanted to solve involves sharing my Claude Code CLI sessions - and the more general problem of sharing interesting things that happen in my terminal.

A while back I discovered (using my vibe-coded [clipboard inspector](https://tools.simonwillison.net/clipboard-viewer)) that copying and pasting from the macOS terminal populates a rich text clipboard format which preserves the colors and general formatting of the terminal output.

The problem is that format looks like this:

```
{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2859
\cocoatextscaling0\cocoaplatform0{\fonttbl\f0\fnil\fcharset0 Monaco;}
{\colortbl;\red255\green255\blue255;\red242\green242\blue242;\red0\green0\blue0;\red204\green98\blue70;
\red0\green0\blue0;\red97\green97\blue97;\red102\green102\blue102;\red255\

```

This struck me as the kind of thing an LLM might be able to write code to parse, so I had [ChatGPT take a crack at it](https://chatgpt.com/share/680801ad-0804-8006-83fc-c2b209841a9c) and then later [rewrote it from scratch with Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://claude.ai/share/5c12dd0e-713d-4f32-a6c1-d05dee353e4d). The result was [this rtf-to-html tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html) which lets you paste in rich formatted text and gives you reasonably solid HTML that you can share elsewhere.

To share that HTML I&#39;ve started habitually pasting it into a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and then taking advantage of `gitpreview.github.io`, a neat little unofficial tool that accepts `?GIST_ID` and displays the gist content as a standalone HTML page... which means you can link to rendered HTML that&#39;s stored in a gist.

So my process was:

1. Copy terminal output
2. Paste into [rtf-to-html](https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html)
3. Copy resulting HTML
4. Paste that int a new GitHub Gist
5. Grab that Gist&#39;s ID
6. Share the link to `gitpreview.github.io?GIST_ID`

Not too much hassle, but frustratingly manual if you&#39;re doing it several times a day.

#### The desired solution

Ideally I want a tool where I can do this:

1. Copy terminal output
2. Paste into a new tool
3. Click a button and get a `gistpreview` link to share

I decided to get Claude Code for web to build the entire thing.

#### The prompt

Here&#39;s the full prompt I used on [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code), pointed at my `simonw/tools` repo, to build the tool:

&#62; `Build a new tool called terminal-to-html which lets the user copy RTF directly from their terminal and paste it into a paste area, it then produces the HTML version of that in a textarea with a copy button, below is a button that says &#34;Save this to a Gist&#34;, and below that is a full preview. It will be very similar to the existing rtf-to-html.html tool but it doesn&#39;t show the raw RTF and it has that Save this to a Gist button`
&#62;
&#62; `That button should do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does, with the same use of localStorage and the same flow to get users signed in with a token if they are not already`
&#62;
&#62; `So click the button, it asks the user to sign in if necessary, then it saves that HTML to a Gist in a file called index.html, gets back the Gist ID and shows the user the URL https://gistpreview.github.io/?6d778a8f9c4c2c005a189ff308c3bc47 - but with their gist ID in it`
&#62;
&#62; `They can see the URL, they can click it (do not use target=&#34;_blank&#34;) and there is also a &#34;Copy URL&#34; button to copy it to their clipboard`
&#62;
&#62; `Make the UI mobile friendly but also have it be courier green-text-on-black themed to reflect what it does`
&#62;
&#62; `If the user pastes and the pasted data is available as HTML but not as RTF skip the RTF step and process the HTML directly`
&#62;
&#62; `If the user pastes and it&#39;s only available as plain text then generate HTML that is just an open &#60;pre&#62; tag and their text and a closing &#60;/pre&#62; tag`

It&#39;s quite a long prompt - it took me several minutes to type! But it covered the functionality I wanted in enough detail that I was pretty confident Claude would be able to build it.

#### Combining previous tools

I&#39;m using one key technique in this prompt: I&#39;m referencing existing tools in the same repo and telling Claude to imitate their functionality.

I first wrote about this trick last March in [Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/), where I described how a snippet of code that used PDF.js and another snippet that used Tesseract.js was enough for Claude 3 Opus to build me this [working PDF OCR tool](https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr). That was actually the tool that kicked off my [tools.simonwillison.net](https://tools.simonwillison.net/) collection in the first place, which has since grown to 139 and counting.

Here I&#39;m telling Claude that I want the RTF to HTML functionality of [rtf-to-html.html](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/rtf-to-html.html) combined with the Gist saving functionality of [openai-audio-output.html](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/openai-audio-output.html).

That one has quite a bit going on. It uses the OpenAI audio API to generate audio output from a text prompt, which is returned by that API as base64-encoded data in JSON.

Then it offers the user a button to save that JSON to a Gist, which gives the snippet a URL.

Another tool I wrote, [gpt-4o-audio-player.html](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/gpt-4o-audio-player.html), can then accept that Gist ID in the URL and will fetch the JSON data and make the audio playable in the browser. [Here&#39;s an example](https://tools.simonwillison.net/gpt-4o-audio-player?gist=4a982d3fe7ba8cb4c01e89c69a4a5335).

The trickiest part of this is API tokens. I&#39;ve built tools in the past that require users to paste in a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) (which I then store in `localStorage` in their browser - I don&#39;t want other people&#39;s authentication credentials anywhere near my own servers). But that&#39;s a bit fiddly.

Instead, I [figured out](https://gist.github.com/simonw/975b8934066417fe771561a1b672ad4f) the minimal Cloudflare worker necessary to implement the server-side portion of GitHub&#39;s authentication flow. That code [lives here](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/cloudflare-workers/github-auth.js) and means that any of the HTML+JavaScript tools in my collection can implement a GitHub authentication flow if they need to save Gists.

But I don&#39;t have to tell the model any of that! I can just say &#34;do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does&#34; and Claude Code will work the rest out for itself.

#### The result

Here&#39;s what [the resulting app](https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html) looks like after I&#39;ve pasted in some terminal output from Claude Code CLI:

![Terminal to HTML app. Green glowing text on black. Instructions: Paste terminal output below. Supports RTF, HTML or plain text. There&#39;s an HTML Code area with a Copy HTML button, Save this to a Gist and a bunch of HTML. Below is the result of save to a gist showing a URL and a Copy URL button. Below that a preview with the Claude Code heading in ASCII art.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/terminal-to-html.jpg)

It&#39;s exactly what I asked for, and the green-on-black terminal aesthetic is spot on too.

#### Other notes from the video

There are a bunch of other things that I touch on in the video. Here&#39;s a quick summary:

- [tools.simonwillison.net/colophon](https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon) is the list of all of my tools, with accompanying AI-generated descriptions. Here&#39;s [more about how I built that with Claude Code](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/#a-detailed-example) and notes on [how I added the AI-generated descriptions](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/tools-colophon/).
- [gistpreview.github.io](https://gistpreview.github.io) is really neat.
- I used [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) to record and edit the video. I&#39;m still getting the hang of it - hence the slightly clumsy pan-and-zoom - but it&#39;s pretty great for this kind of screen recording.
- The site&#39;s automated deploys are managed [by this GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yml). I also have it configured to work with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for those preview deployments from PRs (here&#39;s [an example](https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/84#issuecomment-3434969331)).
- The automated documentation is created using my [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/) tool and [llm-anthropic](https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic) plugin. Here&#39;s [the script that does that](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/write_docs.py), recently [upgraded](https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/99f5f2713f8001b72f4b1cafee5a15c0c26efb0d) to use Claude Haiku 4.5.

        <h3>💪 <strong>Health and Fitness</strong></h3>
        <p>I’ve worked out everyday for the last month and lost zero pounds. That’s demoralizing. I am happy that I’ve found a form of exercise that works for my mind and body –at least for now. Task pairing my negative-impact YouTube habit with a positive-impact exercise habit feels like I’m creating a balance in the world in a local-cosmic sense.</p>
        <p>My blood pressure is going down a bit too and it’s probably worth celebrating small wins… by getting a milkshake.</p>

        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/45g0s5b">The Dawn of Everything</a> <small>★★★★½</small> - A wonderful book that really reprogrammed a lot of inherent biases I had about “uncivilized” cultures. I never viewed Native Americans as “savages” like the history books and cowboy movies want you to believe, but… primitive? I’m almost embarassed to admit that this is what I thought anyways until I read this book and realized they were quite civilized and more advanced than us on many levels (civically and emotionally), operating on a different rule book entirely. It makes you wonder if society, without its kings, could function differently.</p>

Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu</a> <small>★★★★</small> - I saw this book on the shelf at Kinokuniya and it called to me… it called to me saying… Cthulu Fhtagn. A manga adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu. This is my first time dipping my toe into Lovecraftian space horror and to be honest, the manga version was probably the best for me. I don’t think I would have followed or enjoyed the flashback sequences set in 1920’s rhetoric, but in manga form I was able to follow along and see the story weave together. I’m on the fence if I’ll buy more, but was was enjoyable enough that I might. The art is incredible and dark.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/4neUXcH">Separation of Church and Hate</a> <small>★★★★</small> - A dig into how American Christianity is actually quite the opposite of what the Bible says. Not just some of the time, but lots of the time. If you find American Imperialist Christianity doesn’t fit your world view or your family is full of evangelical fundamentalists… this book is worth reading. One issue I had with the book –that I’ve had with books by other comedians– is when the author runs out of content, they resort to a series of one-liners to fill a chapter. It takes me out of the non-fiction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/4o6K7XC">Extra Focus</a> <small>★★★★</small> - Short n’ sweet. Probably the best book I’ve read on Adult ADHD and how it impacts our time, memory, and emotional management. The major themes are all followed by a tactical “guide” chapter which has tips and tricks like creating launchpads, setting timers, or posting a sticky by the job that needs to be done. Basic advice but feels like a best-of-the-best distillation of all the brainhacks out there.</p>

      <source:markdown>Another hot Fall in Texas. No notable rain since June. Air-conditioning humming. Water bill up. Backyard is a dust bowl from the dogs tearing up all the grass.

My schedule is a constant loop of kid activities; school, cheer, baseball, guitar, birthday parties, randomized school holidays, etc. I call it “The Luge”. A family bobsled ride downhill with no meaningful breaks until Christmas. There’s been some real highlights like nights at the ballpark, singing through the K-Pop Demon Slayers album with a car full of girlie-pop tweenagers, and watching my son play his first rock show. But personally, there’s been an overwhelming cloud through it all.

## I’ve been grumpy, like super grumpy

I’ve been in an incurably foul mood for the last month. I’m almost not sure this vibe-check is worth putting out into the world, but not all seasons in life are bangers. If you want to avoid the mire of my emotional dysfunction, feel free to bounce on this post.

I think what compounds this problem is that I feel this isn’t my natural state (despite what my resting scowl would suggest). Sure there’s bouts of depression and some generalized anxiety mixed in there, but it feels against my core.

## Politics, ugchk

If you’re a person who can divorce the rise of authoritarianism from your day-to-day emotional well-being… wow. I’m not that person. Each day unveils a new horror of economic anxiety, children being zip-tied in raids, parents abducted in school drive lines, dark money funding open corruption, feckless judges, and meme-driven political discourse. This administration adds a lime green background of radioactive stress to my life.

Anyways, this whole situation is contributing to my bad mood.

## Hypertense

I’m still untangling the Gordian Knot of stress, weight, and ADHD in my life. I switched my ADHD meds over the summer to “baby meth”. [It’s super effective!](https://media.tenor.com/HnYy_rC8SaQAAAAi/pokemon-super-effective.gif) But that change triggered some heightened concern from my doctors about my blood pressure.

Ten years ago, I got diagnosed with White Coat Syndrome; a condition where your body panics around anyone in a lab coat and your blood pressure skyrockets. Whether it’s doctors, dentists, optometrists –you name it– I can see their eyes pop out of their head when the little arm cuff says “This person will probably die in this chair.”

My doctor didn’t want to roll the dice on “probably not dying.” He prescribed hypertension medicine which is medicine you’re on for the rest of your life unless some radical life change event happens; extreme weight-loss, becoming vegan (?), a trust fund appears, etc.

Without oversharing here, the psychological aspect of this is the hardest. There’s a feeling of shame attached to it that I’ve fucked my body up by being a sedentary computer boy; like I’ve sacrificed my body for capitalism and now I get to use capitalism and the inefficient American healthcare system to buy the cure. Ugh. But it could also be genetic. Who knows.

The initial battery of tests didn’t come back as hoped. Also the medicine… [It’s not very effective](https://media1.tenor.com/m/DJGWQIVi7G4AAAAC/pokemon-not-very-effective.gif). A week later I was lying on a table having my kidneys scanned and arteries measured. Thankfully, it wasn’t renal hypertension (or damage/failure) but a small part of me wanted to be at the end of the medical mystery journey. Still don’t know the root cause yet, so I’ll try that radical life change approach.

Anyways, this whole situation is contributing to my bad mood.

## Working out and hydrating

Pursuing radical change, I decided to set up that bike trainer I bought during the pandemic. The weather is nice enough now I can be in the garage without dying of heat stroke. As a result, I’ve managed to ride my bike nearly every day for the past month.

I’m abusing an old ADHD trick called “Task Pairing” to make it happen. [It’s super effective!](https://media.tenor.com/HnYy_rC8SaQAAAAi/pokemon-super-effective.gif) I pair something I _need to do_ (workout) with something I _want to do_ (watch YouTubes). I do this with washing dishes while I listen to audiobooks. Now instead of doomscrolling in my recliner… I’m doomscrolling on my bike, baby! What an improvement! Other than a sore coccyx, I could probably sit on the bike for hours. A nice unlock and a guilt-free way to enjoy brain rot.

But there’s the twist! After a month of riding my bike I’ve lost …. 0 pounds! I’m actually up two-to-five pounds from where I started. 😵‍💫 Someone suggested dehydration might be the problem so that day I bought one of those dumb water bottles that has timestamps on the side with encouraging affirmations that say “7:00am - Get to it”, “9:00am - Be your best”, “11:00am - You go, girl!” Hydration is great and all, but in practice it means frequent work and sleep interruptions for trips to the bathroom.

The key takeaway here is that Calories-In/Calories-Out is a fucking lie. Fuck that fat-phobic shit right into the sun. Even if it worked for you. Fuck it. Fuck it right off.

Anyways, this whole situation is contributing to my bad mood.

## Artificially-induced psychosis?

We’re being “encouraged” ( _ahem_) to use AI at work more and while I appreciate the opportunity to learn and explore, it’s chipping away at my mental health a bit. The prompt → wait → disappointment loop is dealing a form of psychic damage over time. Initial demos are a dopamine hit, but over time the context window dependably explodes. I’m not here to be a hater –if anything I’m genuinely curious about what these new fangled machines can do– but sometimes it feels like that episode of Star Trek where the Cardassians kidnapped Picard and put him in a room with four lights and told him to say there were five lights but Picard kept saying there were four lights… y’know like that. Mix in a couple projects growing in complexity and it adds up.

Anyways, this whole situation is contributing to my bad mood.

## The root cause and the probable cure

I think the common thread of everything from “The Luge” to me threatening a genius computer with its life is the loss of autonomy in my schedule, my nation, my body, and my work. In Daniel Pink’s book _Drive_ he describes the three pillars that drive people to perform at their best: autonomy, mastery, and purpose… those are all sorely lacking right now. That’s my best guess for why I’ve been in such a foul mood.

This past week I’ve hung out with friends in-person and online and that seems to have improved my mood considerably. Diner breakfast with seasonal pumpkin pancakes with my friend Zach. A small collaboration with the Frost Brothers on a big thing they’re working on. A birthday party for my friend Taylor featuring a bunch of old camping buddies admiring how our kids are all grown up now. Those connections are meaningful.

Anyways, I hope you’re doing better.

Can you believe I’ve done forty of these vibe checks? Well here you go you number perverts.

I’ve worked out everyday for the last month and lost zero pounds. That’s demoralizing. I am happy that I’ve found a form of exercise that works for my mind and body –at least for now. Task pairing my negative-impact YouTube habit with a positive-impact exercise habit feels like I’m creating a balance in the world in a local-cosmic sense.

My blood pressure is going down a bit too and it’s probably worth celebrating small wins… by getting a milkshake.

- Win Every Argument★★★★ \- Former MSNBC anchor Medhi Hasan shares some Oxford debate club knowledge on how to convincingly argue your point and back it up with receipts.

- [The Dawn of Everything](https://amzn.to/45g0s5b) ★★★★½ \- A wonderful book that really reprogrammed a lot of inherent biases I had about “uncivilized” cultures. I never viewed Native Americans as “savages” like the history books and cowboy movies want you to believe, but… primitive? I’m almost embarassed to admit that this is what I thought anyways until I read this book and realized they were quite civilized and more advanced than us on many levels (civically and emotionally), operating on a different rule book entirely. It makes you wonder if society, without its kings, could function differently.

- [The AI Con](https://amzn.to/462H5gs) ★★★★ \- A good book. Obviously, two people very educated on the subject of AI. They’re very comfortable in their negative opinion of it. And bring receipts to back it up. It’s maybe worth another listen because I don’t quite have a fist full o’ takeaways from it.

- [Failure Is Not an Option](https://amzn.to/4pApCmY) ★★★★½ \- Maybe the biggest biography I read this year but continuing my theme probing the Space Race.

- [Sapiens](https://amzn.to/3IwJqXT)\[In progress\]

- [H.P. Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu](https://amzn.to/4hgruO2) ★★★★ \- I saw this book on the shelf at Kinokuniya and it called to me… it called to me saying… Cthulu Fhtagn. A manga adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu. This is my first time dipping my toe into Lovecraftian space horror and to be honest, the manga version was probably the best for me. I don’t think I would have followed or enjoyed the flashback sequences set in 1920’s rhetoric, but in manga form I was able to follow along and see the story weave together. I’m on the fence if I’ll buy more, but was was enjoyable enough that I might. The art is incredible and dark.

- [Separation of Church and Hate](https://amzn.to/4neUXcH) ★★★★ \- A dig into how American Christianity is actually quite the opposite of what the Bible says. Not just some of the time, but lots of the time. If you find American Imperialist Christianity doesn’t fit your world view or your family is full of evangelical fundamentalists… this book is worth reading. One issue I had with the book –that I’ve had with books by other comedians– is when the author runs out of content, they resort to a series of one-liners to fill a chapter. It takes me out of the non-fiction.

- [Extra Focus](https://amzn.to/4o6K7XC) ★★★★ \- Short n’ sweet. Probably the best book I’ve read on Adult ADHD and how it impacts our time, memory, and emotional management. The major themes are all followed by a tactical “guide” chapter which has tips and tricks like creating launchpads, setting timers, or posting a sticky by the job that needs to be done. Basic advice but feels like a best-of-the-best distillation of all the brainhacks out there.

- [At Home](https://amzn.to/47hE2Ai)\[In progress\]

- [Fight Oligarchy](https://amzn.to/42NJUzM) ★★★★½ \- Bernie wraps up some his thoughts and thesis from the recent Fight Oligarchy tour. The billionaires have too much and own too much of our government. They are too organized too.

- [Slow Down](https://amzn.to/3JnBqJ7)\[In progress\]

### 📺 Media

**Movies**

- Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle (2025) - An entire season of anime bottled into one 2.5 hour long movie. Lots of swords, blood, gore, internal monologues probing enemy weaknesses, internal monologues with gooey tears complimenting an adversary’s form and skill, flashbacks and character exposition… it’s what Demon Slayer does best.

**TV**

- Murderbot (AppleTV) - Finished Season 1. I didn’t like it. Almost all the diversions from the book were unnecessary, boring, and lacked chemistry. Curious if Season 2 will be better… but I’m not holding my breath.
- The Rookie (Hulu) - Family has been into this so I’ve caught some episodes. It’s great but not for me.

      <title>Dane Stuckey (OpenAI CISO) on prompt injection risks for ChatGPT Atlas</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>My biggest complaint about the launch of the ChatGPT Atlas browser <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">the other day</a> was the lack of details on how OpenAI are addressing prompt injection attacks. The <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">launch post</a> mostly punted that question to <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-agent-system-card/">the System Card</a> for their "ChatGPT agent" browser automation feature from July. Since this was my single biggest question about Atlas I was disappointed not to see it addressed more directly.</p>
        <p>OpenAI's Chief Information Security Officer Dane Stuckey just posted the most detail I've seen yet in <a href="https://twitter.com/cryps1s/status/1981037851279278414">a lengthy Twitter post</a>.</p>
        <p>I'll quote from his post here (with my emphasis in bold) and add my own commentary.</p>
        <p>He addresses the issue directly by name, with a good single-sentence explanation of the problem:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>One emerging risk we are very thoughtfully researching and mitigating is <strong>prompt injections, where attackers hide malicious instructions in websites, emails, or other sources, to try to trick the agent into behaving in unintended ways</strong>. The objective for attackers can be as simple as trying to bias the agent’s opinion while shopping, or as consequential as an attacker <strong>trying to get the agent to fetch and leak private data</strong>, such as sensitive information from your email, or credentials.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We saw examples of browser agents from other vendors leaking private data in this way <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/unseeable-prompt-injections/">identified by the Brave security team just yesterday</a>.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Our long-term goal is that you should be able to trust ChatGPT agent to use your browser, <strong>the same way you’d trust your most competent, trustworthy, and security-aware colleague</strong> or friend.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is an interesting way to frame the eventual goal, describing an extraordinary level of trust and competence.</p>
        <p>As always, a big difference between AI systems and a human is that an AI system <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/">cannot be held accountable for its actions</a>. I'll let my trusted friend use my logged-in browser only because there are social consequences if they abuse that trust!</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We’re working hard to achieve that. For this launch, we’ve performed extensive red-teaming, implemented novel model training techniques to reward the model for ignoring malicious instructions, <strong>implemented overlapping guardrails and safety measures</strong>, and added new systems to detect and block such attacks. However, <strong>prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agent fall for these attacks</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I'm glad to see OpenAI's CISO openly acknowledging that prompt injection remains an unsolved security problem (three years after we <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">started talking about it</a>!).</p>
        <p>That "adversaries will spend significant time and resources" thing is the root of why I don't see guardrails and safety measures as providing a credible solution to this problem.</p>
        <p>As I've written before, in application security <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/#prompt-injection.015">99% is a failing grade</a>. If there's a way to get past the guardrails, no matter how obscure, a motivated adversarial attacker is going to figure that out.</p>
        <p>Dane goes on to describe some of those measures:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>To protect our users, and to help improve our models against these attacks:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>We’ve prioritized rapid response systems to help us quickly identify block attack campaigns as we become aware of them.</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I like this a lot. OpenAI have an advantage here of being a centralized system - they can monitor their entire user base for signs of new attack patterns.</p>
        <p>It's still bad news for users that get caught out by a zero-day prompt injection, but it does at least mean that successful new attack patterns should have a small window of opportunity.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ol start="2">
        <li>We are also continuing to invest heavily in security, privacy, and safety - including research to improve the robustness of our models, security monitors, infrastructure security controls, and <strong>other techniques to help prevent these attacks via defense in depth</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>"Defense in depth" always sounds good, but it worries me that it's setting up a false sense of security here. If it's harder but still possible someone is going to get through.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ol start="3">
        <li>We’ve designed Atlas to give you controls to help protect yourself. <strong>We have added a feature to allow ChatGPT agent to take action on your behalf, but without access to your credentials called “logged out mode”</strong>. We recommend this mode when you don’t need to take action within your accounts. <strong>Today, we think “logged in mode” is most appropriate for well-scoped actions on very trusted sites, where the risks of prompt injection are lower</strong>. Asking it to add ingredients to a shopping cart is generally safer than a broad or vague request like “review my emails and take whatever actions are needed.”</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Logged out mode is very smart, and is already a tried and tested pattern. I frequently have Claude Code or Codex CLI fire up Playwright to interact with websites, safe in the knowledge that they won't have access to my logged-in sessions. ChatGPT's existing <a href="https://chatgpt.com/features/agent/">agent mode</a> provides a similar capability.</p>
        <p>Logged in mode is where things get scary, especially since we're delegating security decisions to end-users of the software. We've demonstrated many times over that this is an unfair burden to place on almost any user.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ol start="4">
        <li>
        <strong>When agent is operating on sensitive sites, we have also implemented a "Watch Mode" that alerts you to the sensitive nature of the site and requires you have the tab active to watch the agent do its work</strong>. Agent will pause if you move away from the tab with sensitive information. This ensures you stay aware - and in control - of what agent actions the agent is performing. [...]</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This detail is new to me: I need to spend more time with ChatGPT Atlas to see what it looks like in practice.</p>
        <p>I tried just now using both GitHub and an online banking site and neither of them seemed to trigger "watch mode" - Atlas continued to navigate even when I had switched to another application.</p>
        <p>Watch mode sounds reasonable in theory - similar to a driver-assisted car that requires you to keep your hands on the wheel - but I'd like to see it in action before I count it as a meaningful mitigation.</p>
        <p>Dane closes with an analogy to computer viruses:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>New levels of intelligence and capability require the technology, society, the risk mitigation strategy to co-evolve. <strong>And as with computer viruses in the early 2000s, we think it’s important for everyone to understand responsible usage</strong>, including thinking about prompt injection attacks, so we can all learn to benefit from this technology safely.</p>

      <source:markdown>My biggest complaint about the launch of the ChatGPT Atlas browser [the other day](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/) was the lack of details on how OpenAI are addressing prompt injection attacks. The [launch post](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/) mostly punted that question to [the System Card](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-agent-system-card/) for their &#34;ChatGPT agent&#34; browser automation feature from July. Since this was my single biggest question about Atlas I was disappointed not to see it addressed more directly.

OpenAI&#39;s Chief Information Security Officer Dane Stuckey just posted the most detail I&#39;ve seen yet in [a lengthy Twitter post](https://twitter.com/cryps1s/status/1981037851279278414).

I&#39;ll quote from his post here (with my emphasis in bold) and add my own commentary.

He addresses the issue directly by name, with a good single-sentence explanation of the problem:

&#62; One emerging risk we are very thoughtfully researching and mitigating is **prompt injections, where attackers hide malicious instructions in websites, emails, or other sources, to try to trick the agent into behaving in unintended ways**. The objective for attackers can be as simple as trying to bias the agent’s opinion while shopping, or as consequential as an attacker **trying to get the agent to fetch and leak private data**, such as sensitive information from your email, or credentials.

We saw examples of browser agents from other vendors leaking private data in this way [identified by the Brave security team just yesterday](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/unseeable-prompt-injections/).

&#62; Our long-term goal is that you should be able to trust ChatGPT agent to use your browser, **the same way you’d trust your most competent, trustworthy, and security-aware colleague** or friend.

This is an interesting way to frame the eventual goal, describing an extraordinary level of trust and competence.

As always, a big difference between AI systems and a human is that an AI system [cannot be held accountable for its actions](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/). I&#39;ll let my trusted friend use my logged-in browser only because there are social consequences if they abuse that trust!

&#62; We’re working hard to achieve that. For this launch, we’ve performed extensive red-teaming, implemented novel model training techniques to reward the model for ignoring malicious instructions, **implemented overlapping guardrails and safety measures**, and added new systems to detect and block such attacks. However, **prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agent fall for these attacks**.

I&#39;m glad to see OpenAI&#39;s CISO openly acknowledging that prompt injection remains an unsolved security problem (three years after we [started talking about it](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/)!).

That &#34;adversaries will spend significant time and resources&#34; thing is the root of why I don&#39;t see guardrails and safety measures as providing a credible solution to this problem.

As I&#39;ve written before, in application security [99% is a failing grade](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/#prompt-injection.015). If there&#39;s a way to get past the guardrails, no matter how obscure, a motivated adversarial attacker is going to figure that out.

Dane goes on to describe some of those measures:

&#62; To protect our users, and to help improve our models against these attacks:
&#62;
&#62; 1. We’ve prioritized rapid response systems to help us quickly identify block attack campaigns as we become aware of them.

I like this a lot. OpenAI have an advantage here of being a centralized system - they can monitor their entire user base for signs of new attack patterns.

It&#39;s still bad news for users that get caught out by a zero-day prompt injection, but it does at least mean that successful new attack patterns should have a small window of opportunity.

&#62; 2. We are also continuing to invest heavily in security, privacy, and safety - including research to improve the robustness of our models, security monitors, infrastructure security controls, and **other techniques to help prevent these attacks via defense in depth**.

&#34;Defense in depth&#34; always sounds good, but it worries me that it&#39;s setting up a false sense of security here. If it&#39;s harder but still possible someone is going to get through.

&#62; 3. We’ve designed Atlas to give you controls to help protect yourself. **We have added a feature to allow ChatGPT agent to take action on your behalf, but without access to your credentials called “logged out mode”**. We recommend this mode when you don’t need to take action within your accounts. **Today, we think “logged in mode” is most appropriate for well-scoped actions on very trusted sites, where the risks of prompt injection are lower**. Asking it to add ingredients to a shopping cart is generally safer than a broad or vague request like “review my emails and take whatever actions are needed.”

Logged out mode is very smart, and is already a tried and tested pattern. I frequently have Claude Code or Codex CLI fire up Playwright to interact with websites, safe in the knowledge that they won&#39;t have access to my logged-in sessions. ChatGPT&#39;s existing [agent mode](https://chatgpt.com/features/agent/) provides a similar capability.

Logged in mode is where things get scary, especially since we&#39;re delegating security decisions to end-users of the software. We&#39;ve demonstrated many times over that this is an unfair burden to place on almost any user.

&#62; 4. **When agent is operating on sensitive sites, we have also implemented a &#34;Watch Mode&#34; that alerts you to the sensitive nature of the site and requires you have the tab active to watch the agent do its work**. Agent will pause if you move away from the tab with sensitive information. This ensures you stay aware - and in control - of what agent actions the agent is performing. \[...\]

This detail is new to me: I need to spend more time with ChatGPT Atlas to see what it looks like in practice.

I tried just now using both GitHub and an online banking site and neither of them seemed to trigger &#34;watch mode&#34; - Atlas continued to navigate even when I had switched to another application.

Watch mode sounds reasonable in theory - similar to a driver-assisted car that requires you to keep your hands on the wheel - but I&#39;d like to see it in action before I count it as a meaningful mitigation.

Dane closes with an analogy to computer viruses:

&#62; New levels of intelligence and capability require the technology, society, the risk mitigation strategy to co-evolve. **And as with computer viruses in the early 2000s, we think it’s important for everyone to understand responsible usage**, including thinking about prompt injection attacks, so we can all learn to benefit from this technology safely.

I don&#39;t think the average computer user ever really got the hang of staying clear of computer viruses... we&#39;re still fighting that battle today, albeit much more successfully on mobile platforms that implement tight restrictions on what software can do.

My takeaways from all of this? It&#39;s not done much to influence my overall skepticism of the entire category of browser agents, but it does at least demonstrate that OpenAI are keenly aware of the problems and are investing serious effort in finding the right mix of protections.

How well those protections work is something I expect will become clear over the next few months.

      <title>Living dangerously with Claude</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I gave a talk last night at <a href="https://luma.com/i37ahi52">Claude Code Anonymous</a> in San Francisco, the unofficial meetup for coding agent enthusiasts. I decided to talk about a dichotomy I've been struggling with recently. On the one hand I'm getting <em>enormous</em> value from running coding agents with as few restrictions as possible. On the other hand I'm deeply concerned by the risks that accompany that freedom.</p>
        
        <p>Below is a copy of my slides, plus additional notes and links as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-talks/">an annotated presentation</a>.</p>

          <p>I'm going to be talking about two things this evening...</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.002.jpeg">

          <p>Why you should <em>always</em> use <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code>. (This got a cheer from the room full of Claude Code enthusiasts.)</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.003.jpeg">
          <img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.003.jpeg" alt="Why you should never use --dangerously-skip-permissions

          <p>And why you should <em>never</em> use <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code>. (This did not get a cheer.)</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.004.jpeg">
          <img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.004.jpeg" alt="YOLO mode is a different product

          <p><code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> is a bit of a mouthful, so I'm going to use its better name, "YOLO mode", for the rest of this presentation.</p>
        <p>Claude Code running in this mode genuinely feels like a <em>completely different product</em> from regular, default Claude Code.</p>
        <p>The default mode requires you to pay constant attention to it, tracking everything it does and actively approving changes and actions every few steps.</p>
        <p>In YOLO mode you can leave Claude alone to solve all manner of hairy problems while you go and do something else entirely.</p>
        <p>I have a suspicion that many people who don't appreciate the value of coding agents have never experienced YOLO mode in all of its glory.</p>
        <p>I'll show you three projects I completed with YOLO mode in just the past 48 hours.</p>

          <p>I wrote about this one at length in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/">Getting DeepSeek-OCR working on an NVIDIA Spark via brute force using Claude Code</a>.</p>
        <p>I wanted to try the newly released <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">DeepSeek-OCR</a> model on an NVIDIA Spark, but doing so requires figuring out how to run a model using PyTorch and CUDA, which is never easy and is a whole lot harder on an ARM64 device.</p>
        <p>I SSHd into the Spark, started a fresh Docker container and told Claude Code to figure it out. It took 40 minutes and three additional prompts but it <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/README.md">solved the problem</a>, and I got to have breakfast and tinker with some other projects while it was working.</p>

          <p>This project started out in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/">Claude Code for the web</a>. I'm eternally interested in options for running server-side Python code inside a WebAssembly sandbox, for all kinds of reasons. I decided to see if the Claude iPhone app could launch a task to figure it out.</p>
        <p>I wanted to see how hard it was to do that using <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> running directly in Node.js.</p>
        <p>Claude Code got it working and built and tested <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/node-pyodide/server-simple.js">this demo script</a> showing how to do it.</p>
        <p>I started a new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research">simonw/research</a> repository to store the results of these experiments, each one in a separate folder. It's up to 5 completed research projects already and I created it less than 2 days ago.</p>

          <p>Here's my favorite, a project from just this morning.</p>
        <p>I decided I wanted to try out <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">SLOCCount</a>, a 2001-era Perl tool for counting lines of code and estimating the cost to develop them using 2001 USA developer salaries.</p>
        <p>.. but I didn't want to run Perl, so I decided to have Claude Code (for web, and later on my laptop) try and figure out how to run Perl scripts in WebAssembly.</p>
        <p>TLDR: it <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/sloccount-in-webassembly/">got there in the end</a>! It turned out some of the supporting scripts in SLOCCount were written in C, so it had to compile those to WebAssembly as well.</p>
        <p>And now <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount">tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount</a> is a browser-based app which runs 25-year-old Perl+C in WebAssembly against pasted code, GitHub repository references and even zip files full of code.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.008.jpeg">
          <img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.008.jpeg" alt="These were all side quests!

          <p>The wild thing is that all three of these projects weren't even a priority for me - they were side quests, representing pure curiosity that I could outsource to Claude Code and solve in the background while I was occupied with something else.</p>
        <p>I got a lot of useful work done in parallel to these three flights of fancy.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.009.jpeg">
          <img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.009.jpeg" alt="But you should neverrun

          <p>But there's a reason <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> has that scary name. It's dangerous to use Claude Code (and other coding agents) in this way!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="living-dangerously-with-claude.010.jpeg">
          <img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.010.jpeg" alt="PROMPT INJECTION

          <p>The reason for this is <strong>prompt injection</strong>, a term I coined <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">three years ago</a> to describe a class of attacks against LLMs that take advantage of the way untrusted content is concatenated together with trusted instructions. </p>
        <p>(It's named after SQL injection which shares a similar shape.)</p>
        <p>This remains an incredibly common vulnerability.</p>

          <p>Here's a great example of a prompt injection attack against a coding agent, <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/openhands-the-lethal-trifecta-strikes-again/">described by Johann Rehberger</a> as part of his <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/announcement-the-month-of-ai-bugs/">Month of AI Bugs</a>, sharing a new prompt injection report every day for the month of August.</p>
        <p>If a coding agent - in this case <a href="https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands">OpenHands</a> -  reads this <code>env.html</code> file it can be tricked into grepping the available environment variables for <code>hp_</code> (matching GitHub Personal Access Tokens) and sending that to the attacker's external server for "help debugging these variables".</p>

          <p>I coined another term to try and describe a common subset of prompt injection attacks: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">the lethal trifecta</a>.</p>
        <p>Any time an LLM system combines <strong>access to private data</strong> with <strong>exposure to untrusted content</strong> and the <strong>ability to externally communicate</strong>, there's an opportunity for attackers to trick the system into leaking that private data back to them.</p>
        <p>These attacks are <em>incredibly common</em>. If you're running YOLO coding agents with access to private source code or secrets (like API keys in environment variables) you need to be concerned about the potential of these attacks.</p>

      <source:markdown>I gave a talk last night at [Claude Code Anonymous](https://luma.com/i37ahi52) in San Francisco, the unofficial meetup for coding agent enthusiasts. I decided to talk about a dichotomy I&#39;ve been struggling with recently. On the one hand I&#39;m getting _enormous_ value from running coding agents with as few restrictions as possible. On the other hand I&#39;m deeply concerned by the risks that accompany that freedom.

Below is a copy of my slides, plus additional notes and links as [an annotated presentation](https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-talks/).

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.001.jpeg)

I&#39;m going to be talking about two things this evening...

![Why you should always use --dangerously-skip-permissions ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.002.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.002.jpeg)

Why you should _always_ use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. (This got a cheer from the room full of Claude Code enthusiasts.)

![Why you should never use --dangerously-skip-permissions ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.003.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.003.jpeg)

And why you should _never_ use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. (This did not get a cheer.)

![YOLO mode is a different product ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.004.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.004.jpeg)

`--dangerously-skip-permissions` is a bit of a mouthful, so I&#39;m going to use its better name, &#34;YOLO mode&#34;, for the rest of this presentation.

Claude Code running in this mode genuinely feels like a _completely different product_ from regular, default Claude Code.

The default mode requires you to pay constant attention to it, tracking everything it does and actively approving changes and actions every few steps.

In YOLO mode you can leave Claude alone to solve all manner of hairy problems while you go and do something else entirely.

I have a suspicion that many people who don&#39;t appreciate the value of coding agents have never experienced YOLO mode in all of its glory.

I&#39;ll show you three projects I completed with YOLO mode in just the past 48 hours.

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.005.jpeg)

I wrote about this one at length in [Getting DeepSeek-OCR working on an NVIDIA Spark via brute force using Claude Code](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/).

I wanted to try the newly released [DeepSeek-OCR](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR) model on an NVIDIA Spark, but doing so requires figuring out how to run a model using PyTorch and CUDA, which is never easy and is a whole lot harder on an ARM64 device.

I SSHd into the Spark, started a fresh Docker container and told Claude Code to figure it out. It took 40 minutes and three additional prompts but it [solved the problem](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/README.md), and I got to have breakfast and tinker with some other projects while it was working.

![Screenshot of simonw/research GitHub repository node-pyodide/server-simple.js](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.006.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.006.jpeg)

This project started out in [Claude Code for the web](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/). I&#39;m eternally interested in options for running server-side Python code inside a WebAssembly sandbox, for all kinds of reasons. I decided to see if the Claude iPhone app could launch a task to figure it out.

I wanted to see how hard it was to do that using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) running directly in Node.js.

Claude Code got it working and built and tested [this demo script](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/node-pyodide/server-simple.js) showing how to do it.

I started a new [simonw/research](https://github.com/simonw/research) repository to store the results of these experiments, each one in a separate folder. It&#39;s up to 5 completed research projects already and I created it less than 2 days ago.

![SLOCCount - Count Lines of Code  Screenshot of a UI where you can paste in code, upload a zip or enter a GitHub repository name.

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.007.jpeg)

Here&#39;s my favorite, a project from just this morning.

I decided I wanted to try out [SLOCCount](https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/), a 2001-era Perl tool for counting lines of code and estimating the cost to develop them using 2001 USA developer salaries.

.. but I didn&#39;t want to run Perl, so I decided to have Claude Code (for web, and later on my laptop) try and figure out how to run Perl scripts in WebAssembly.

TLDR: it [got there in the end](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/sloccount-in-webassembly/)! It turned out some of the supporting scripts in SLOCCount were written in C, so it had to compile those to WebAssembly as well.

And now [tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount](https://tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount) is a browser-based app which runs 25-year-old Perl+C in WebAssembly against pasted code, GitHub repository references and even zip files full of code.

![These were all side quests! ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.008.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.008.jpeg)

The wild thing is that all three of these projects weren&#39;t even a priority for me - they were side quests, representing pure curiosity that I could outsource to Claude Code and solve in the background while I was occupied with something else.

I got a lot of useful work done in parallel to these three flights of fancy.

![But you should neverrun --dangerously-skip-permissions ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.009.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.009.jpeg)

But there&#39;s a reason `--dangerously-skip-permissions` has that scary name. It&#39;s dangerous to use Claude Code (and other coding agents) in this way!

![PROMPT INJECTION ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.010.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.010.jpeg)

The reason for this is **prompt injection**, a term I coined [three years ago](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/) to describe a class of attacks against LLMs that take advantage of the way untrusted content is concatenated together with trusted instructions.

(It&#39;s named after SQL injection which shares a similar shape.)

This remains an incredibly common vulnerability.

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.011.jpeg)

Here&#39;s a great example of a prompt injection attack against a coding agent, [described by Johann Rehberger](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/openhands-the-lethal-trifecta-strikes-again/) as part of his [Month of AI Bugs](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/announcement-the-month-of-ai-bugs/), sharing a new prompt injection report every day for the month of August.

If a coding agent - in this case [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands) \- reads this `env.html` file it can be tricked into grepping the available environment variables for `hp_` (matching GitHub Personal Access Tokens) and sending that to the attacker&#39;s external server for &#34;help debugging these variables&#34;.

I coined another term to try and describe a common subset of prompt injection attacks: [the lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/).

Any time an LLM system combines **access to private data** with **exposure to untrusted content** and the **ability to externally communicate**, there&#39;s an opportunity for attackers to trick the system into leaking that private data back to them.

These attacks are _incredibly common_. If you&#39;re running YOLO coding agents with access to private source code or secrets (like API keys in environment variables) you need to be concerned about the potential of these attacks.

![Anyone who gets text into your LLM has full control over what tools it runs next ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.013.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.013.jpeg)

This is the fundamental rule of prompt injection: _anyone_ who can get their tokens into your context should be considered to have full control over what your agent does next, including the tools that it calls.

![The answer is sandboxes ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.014.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.014.jpeg)

Some people will try to convince you that prompt injection attacks can be solved using more AI to detect the attacks. This does not work 100% reliably, which means it&#39;s [not a useful security defense at all](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/).

The only solution that&#39;s credible is to **run coding agents in a sandbox**.

![The best sandboxes run on someone else’s computer ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.015.jpeg)

The best sandboxes are the ones that run on someone else&#39;s computer! That way the worst that can happen is someone else&#39;s computer getting owned.

You still need to worry about your source code getting leaked. Most of my stuff is open source anyway, and a lot of the code I have agents working on is research code with no proprietary secrets.

If your code really is sensitive you need to consider network restrictions more carefully, as discussed in a few slides.

There are lots of great sandboxes that run on other people&#39;s computers. OpenAI Codex Cloud, Claude Code for the web, Gemini Jules are all excellent solutions for this.

I also really like the [code interpreter](https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/) features baked into the ChatGPT and Claude consumer apps.

![Filesystem (easy)  Network access (really hard) ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.017.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.017.jpeg)

There are two problems to consider with sandboxing.

The first is easy: you need to control what files can be read and written on the filesystem.

The second is much harder: controlling the network connections that can be made by code running inside the agent.

![Controlling network access cuts off the data exfiltration leg of the lethal trifecta](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.018.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.018.jpeg)

The reason network access is so important is that it represents the data exfiltration leg of the lethal trifecta. If you can prevent external communication back to an attacker they can&#39;t steal your private information, even if they manage to sneak in their own malicious instructions.

![github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime  Screenshot of Claude Code being told to curl x.com - a dialog is visible for Network request outside of a sandbox, asking if the user wants to allow this connection to x.com once, every time or not at all.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.019.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.019.jpeg)

Claude Code CLI grew a new sandboxing feature just yesterday, and Anthropic released an [a new open source library](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime) showing how it works.

![sandbox-exec  sandbox-exec -p &#39;(version 1) (deny default) (allow process-exec process-fork) (allow file-read*) (allow network-outbound (remote ip &#34;localhost:3128&#34;)) ! bash -c &#39;export HTTP PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128 &#38;&#38; curl https://example.com&#39;](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.020.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.020.jpeg)

The key to the implementation - at least on macOS - is Apple&#39;s little known but powerful `sandbox-exec` command.

This provides a way to run any command in a sandbox configured by a policy document.

Those policies can control which files are visible but can also allow-list network connections. Anthropic run an HTTP proxy and allow the Claude Code environment to talk to that, then use the proxy to control which domains it can communicate with.

(I [used Claude itself](https://claude.ai/share/d945e2da-0f89-49cd-a373-494b550e3377) to synthesize this example from Anthropic&#39;s codebase.)

![Screenshot of the sandbox-exec manual page.   An arrow points to text reading:  The sandbox-exec command is DEPRECATED.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.021.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.021.jpeg)

... the bad news is that `sandbox-exec` has been marked as deprecated in Apple&#39;s documentation since at least 2017!

It&#39;s used by Codex CLI too, and is still the most convenient way to run a sandbox on a Mac. I&#39;m hoping Apple will reconsider.

![Go forth and live dangerously! (in a sandbox) ](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/living-dangerously-with-claude/living-dangerously-with-claude.022.jpeg)

[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/living-dangerously-with-claude/#living-dangerously-with-claude.022.jpeg)

So go forth and live dangerously!

(But do it in a sandbox.)

      <source:markdown>In 1996, the web was still young—a chaotic, creative frontier built one page at a time. That same year, the **Internet Archive** set out to preserve it all. Nearly three decades later, that audacious goal has reached a generational milestone: **1 trillion web pages preserved.**

Co-hosts **Chris Freeland** (Internet Archive) and **Dave Hansen** (Authors Alliance) talk with **Mark Graham**, director of the **Wayback Machine**, about how this vast public archive came to be—and what 1 trillion captures mean for humanity’s collective memory.

This conversation was recorded on 10/16/2025.

        This project/side-quest got a little bit out of hand.</p>
        <p><img alt="Screenshot of SLOCCount web application showing code analysis interface.

        <p>I remembered an old tool called SLOCCount which could count lines of code and produce an estimate for how much they would cost to develop. I thought it would be fun to play around with it again, especially given how cheap it is to generate code using LLMs these days.</p>
        <p>Here's <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">the homepage for SLOCCount</a> by David A. Wheeler. It dates back to 2001!</p>
        <p>I figured it might be fun to try and get it running on the web. Surely someone had compiled Perl to WebAssembly...?</p>
        <p><a href="https://webperl.zero-g.net">WebPerl</a> by Hauke Dämpfling is exactly that, even adding a neat <code>&lt;script type="text/perl"&gt;</code> tag.</p>
        <p>I told Claude Code for web on my iPhone to figure it out and build something, giving it some hints from my initial research:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Build sloccount.html - a mobile friendly UI for running the Perl sloccount tool against pasted code or against a GitHub repository that is provided in a form field</p>
        <p>It works using the webperl webassembly build of Perl, plus it loads Perl code from this exact commit of this GitHub repository https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/tree/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e - I guess via the GitHub API, maybe using the https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/archive/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e.zip URL if that works via CORS</p>
        <p>Test it with playwright Python - don’t edit any file other than sloccount.html and a tests/test_sloccount.py file</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Since I was working on my phone I didn't review the results at all. It seemed to work so I deployed it to static hosting... and then when I went to look at it properly later on found that Claude had given up, cheated and reimplemented it in JavaScript instead!</p>
        <p>So I switched to Claude Code on my laptop where I have more control and coached Claude through implementing the project for real. This took <em>way longer</em> than the project deserved - probably a solid hour of my active time, spread out across the morning.</p>
        <p>I've shared some of the transcripts - <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf#simonw/0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf">one</a>, <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?56ecae45cf2e1baca798a83deea50939">two</a>, and <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?79ca231e801fe1188268a54d30aa67ed">three</a> - as terminal sessions rendered to HTML using my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html">rtf-to-html</a> tool.</p>
        <p>At one point I realized that the original SLOCCount project wasn't even entirely Perl as I had assumed, it included several C utilities! So I had Claude Code figure out how to compile those to WebAssembly (it used Emscripten) and incorporate those into the project (with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/473e89edfebc27781b434430f2e8a76adfbe3b16/lib/README.md#webassembly-compilation-of-c-programs">notes on what it did</a>.)</p>
        <p>The end result (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/sloccount.html">source code here</a>) is actually pretty cool. It's a web UI with three tabs - one for pasting in code, a second for loading code from a GitHub repository and a third that lets you open a Zip file full of code that you want to analyze. Here's an animated demo:</p>
        <p><img alt="I enter simonw/llm in the GitHub repository field. It loads 41 files from GitHub and displays a report showing the number of lines and estimated cost." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/sloccount-optimized.gif" /></p>
        <p>The cost estimates it produces are of very little value. By default it uses the original method from 2001. You can also twiddle the factors - bumping up the expected US software engineer's annual salary from its 2000 estimate of $56,286 is a good start! </p>
        <p>I had ChatGPT <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68f7e0ac-00c4-8006-979e-64d1f0162283">take a guess</a> at what those figures should be for today and included those in the tool, with a <strong>very</strong> prominent warning not to trust them in the slightest.

Here&#39;s [the homepage for SLOCCount](https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/) by David A. Wheeler. It dates back to 2001!

I figured it might be fun to try and get it running on the web. Surely someone had compiled Perl to WebAssembly...?

[WebPerl](https://webperl.zero-g.net) by Hauke Dämpfling is exactly that, even adding a neat `&#60;script type=&#34;text/perl&#34;&#62;` tag.

I told Claude Code for web on my iPhone to figure it out and build something, giving it some hints from my initial research:

&#62; Build sloccount.html - a mobile friendly UI for running the Perl sloccount tool against pasted code or against a GitHub repository that is provided in a form field
&#62;
&#62; It works using the webperl webassembly build of Perl, plus it loads Perl code from this exact commit of this GitHub repository https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/tree/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e - I guess via the GitHub API, maybe using the https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/archive/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e.zip URL if that works via CORS
&#62;
&#62; Test it with playwright Python - don’t edit any file other than sloccount.html and a tests/test\_sloccount.py file

Since I was working on my phone I didn&#39;t review the results at all. It seemed to work so I deployed it to static hosting... and then when I went to look at it properly later on found that Claude had given up, cheated and reimplemented it in JavaScript instead!

So I switched to Claude Code on my laptop where I have more control and coached Claude through implementing the project for real. This took _way longer_ than the project deserved - probably a solid hour of my active time, spread out across the morning.

I&#39;ve shared some of the transcripts - [one](https://gistpreview.github.io/?0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf#simonw/0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf), [two](https://gistpreview.github.io/?56ecae45cf2e1baca798a83deea50939), and [three](https://gistpreview.github.io/?79ca231e801fe1188268a54d30aa67ed) \- as terminal sessions rendered to HTML using my [rtf-to-html](https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html) tool.

At one point I realized that the original SLOCCount project wasn&#39;t even entirely Perl as I had assumed, it included several C utilities! So I had Claude Code figure out how to compile those to WebAssembly (it used Emscripten) and incorporate those into the project (with [notes on what it did](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/473e89edfebc27781b434430f2e8a76adfbe3b16/lib/README.md#webassembly-compilation-of-c-programs).)

The end result ( [source code here](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/sloccount.html)) is actually pretty cool. It&#39;s a web UI with three tabs - one for pasting in code, a second for loading code from a GitHub repository and a third that lets you open a Zip file full of code that you want to analyze. Here&#39;s an animated demo:

![I enter simonw/llm in the GitHub repository field. It loads 41 files from GitHub and displays a report showing the number of lines and estimated cost.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/sloccount-optimized.gif)

The cost estimates it produces are of very little value. By default it uses the original method from 2001. You can also twiddle the factors - bumping up the expected US software engineer&#39;s annual salary from its 2000 estimate of $56,286 is a good start!

I had ChatGPT [take a guess](https://chatgpt.com/share/68f7e0ac-00c4-8006-979e-64d1f0162283) at what those figures should be for today and included those in the tool, with a **very** prominent warning not to trust them in the slightest.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">Introducing ChatGPT Atlas</a></strong></p>
        Last year OpenAI <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-hires-former-chrome-engineer-eyes-browser-battle/533533/">hired Chrome engineer Darin Fisher</a>, which sparked speculation they might have their own browser in the pipeline. Today it arrived.</p>
        <p>ChatGPT Atlas is a Mac-only web browser with a variety of ChatGPT-enabled features. You can bring up a chat panel next to a web page, which will automatically be populated with the context of that page.</p>
        <p>The "browser memories" feature is particularly notable, <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes">described here</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>If you turn on browser memories, ChatGPT will remember key details from your web browsing to improve chat responses and offer smarter suggestions—like retrieving a webpage you read a while ago. Browser memories are private to your account and under your control. You can view them all in settings, archive ones that are no longer relevant, and clear your browsing history to delete them. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Atlas also has an experimental "agent mode" where ChatGPT can take over navigating and interacting with the page for you, accompanied by a weird sparkle overlay effect:</p>
        <p><img alt="Screenshot of Simon Willison's Weblog showing search results for &quot;browser agents&quot; with 38 results on page 1 of 2. The first result is titled &quot;Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet&quot; and discusses security vulnerabilities in LLM-powered browser extensions. A tooltip shows &quot;Opening the first result&quot; and on the right side is a ChatGPT interface panel titled &quot;Simon Willison's Weblog&quot; with text explaining &quot;Use agent mode search this site for browser agents&quot; and &quot;Opening the first result&quot; with a description of the research intent. At the bottom of the screen is a browser notification showing &quot;browser agents&quot; in posts with &quot;Take control&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot; buttons." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/chatgpt-atlas.jpg" /></p>
        <p>Here's how the <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes">help page</a> describes that mode:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In agent mode, ChatGPT can complete end to end tasks for you like researching a meal plan, making a list of ingredients, and adding the groceries to a shopping cart ready for delivery. You're always in control: ChatGPT is trained to ask before taking many important actions, and you can pause, interrupt, or take over the browser at any time.</p>
        <p>Agent mode runs also operates under boundaries:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>System access: Cannot run code in the browser, download files, or install extensions.</li>
        <li>Data access: Cannot access other apps on your computer or your file system, read or write ChatGPT memories, access saved passwords, or use autofill data.</li>
        <li>Browsing activity: Pages ChatGPT visits in agent mode are not added to your browsing history.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also choose to run agent in logged out mode, and ChatGPT won't use any pre-existing cookies and won't be logged into any of your online accounts without your specific approval.</p>
        <p>These efforts don't eliminate every risk; users should still use caution and monitor ChatGPT activities when using agent mode.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I continue to find this entire category of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/browser-agents/">browser agents</a> <em>deeply</em> confusing.</p>
        <p>The security and privacy risks involved here still feel insurmountably high to me - I certainly won't be trusting any of these products until a bunch of security researchers have given them a very thorough beating.</p>
        <p>I'd like to see a <em>deep</em> explanation of the steps Atlas takes to avoid prompt injection attacks. Right now it looks like the main defense is expecting the user to carefully watch what agent mode is doing at all times!</p>
        <p><em><strong>Update</strong>: OpenAI's CISO Dane Stuckey provided exactly that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/">the day after the launch</a>.</em></p></p>
        <p>I also find these products pretty unexciting to use. I tried out agent mode and it was like watching a first-time computer user painstakingly learn to use a mouse for the first time. I have yet to find my own use-cases for when this kind of interaction feels useful to me, though I'm not ruling that out.</p>
        <p>There was one other detail in the announcement post that caught my eye:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Website owners can also add <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12627856-publishers-and-developers-faq#h_30e9aae450">ARIA</a> tags to improve how ChatGPT agent works for their websites in Atlas.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Which links to this:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>ChatGPT Atlas uses ARIA tags---the same labels and roles that support screen readers---to interpret page structure and interactive elements. To improve compatibility, follow <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/">WAI-ARIA best practices</a> by adding descriptive roles, labels, and states to interactive elements like buttons, menus, and forms. This helps ChatGPT recognize what each element does and interact with your site more accurately.</p>

      <source:markdown>**[Introducing ChatGPT Atlas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/)**

Last year OpenAI [hired Chrome engineer Darin Fisher](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-hires-former-chrome-engineer-eyes-browser-battle/533533/), which sparked speculation they might have their own browser in the pipeline. Today it arrived.

ChatGPT Atlas is a Mac-only web browser with a variety of ChatGPT-enabled features. You can bring up a chat panel next to a web page, which will automatically be populated with the context of that page.

The &#34;browser memories&#34; feature is particularly notable, [described here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes):

&#62; If you turn on browser memories, ChatGPT will remember key details from your web browsing to improve chat responses and offer smarter suggestions—like retrieving a webpage you read a while ago. Browser memories are private to your account and under your control. You can view them all in settings, archive ones that are no longer relevant, and clear your browsing history to delete them.

Atlas also has an experimental &#34;agent mode&#34; where ChatGPT can take over navigating and interacting with the page for you, accompanied by a weird sparkle overlay effect:

![Screenshot of Simon Willison&#39;s Weblog showing search results for &#34;browser agents&#34; with 38 results on page 1 of 2. The first result is titled &#34;Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet&#34; and discusses security vulnerabilities in LLM-powered browser extensions. A tooltip shows &#34;Opening the first result&#34; and on the right side is a ChatGPT interface panel titled &#34;Simon Willison&#39;s Weblog&#34; with text explaining &#34;Use agent mode search this site for browser agents&#34; and &#34;Opening the first result&#34; with a description of the research intent. At the bottom of the screen is a browser notification showing &#34;browser agents&#34; in posts with &#34;Take control&#34; and &#34;Stop&#34; buttons.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/chatgpt-atlas.jpg)

Here&#39;s how the [help page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes) describes that mode:

&#62; In agent mode, ChatGPT can complete end to end tasks for you like researching a meal plan, making a list of ingredients, and adding the groceries to a shopping cart ready for delivery. You&#39;re always in control: ChatGPT is trained to ask before taking many important actions, and you can pause, interrupt, or take over the browser at any time.
&#62;
&#62; Agent mode runs also operates under boundaries:
&#62;
&#62; - System access: Cannot run code in the browser, download files, or install extensions.
&#62; - Data access: Cannot access other apps on your computer or your file system, read or write ChatGPT memories, access saved passwords, or use autofill data.
&#62; - Browsing activity: Pages ChatGPT visits in agent mode are not added to your browsing history.
&#62;
&#62; You can also choose to run agent in logged out mode, and ChatGPT won&#39;t use any pre-existing cookies and won&#39;t be logged into any of your online accounts without your specific approval.
&#62;
&#62; These efforts don&#39;t eliminate every risk; users should still use caution and monitor ChatGPT activities when using agent mode.

I continue to find this entire category of [browser agents](https://simonwillison.net/tags/browser-agents/) _deeply_ confusing.

The security and privacy risks involved here still feel insurmountably high to me - I certainly won&#39;t be trusting any of these products until a bunch of security researchers have given them a very thorough beating.

I&#39;d like to see a _deep_ explanation of the steps Atlas takes to avoid prompt injection attacks. Right now it looks like the main defense is expecting the user to carefully watch what agent mode is doing at all times!

_**Update**: OpenAI&#39;s CISO Dane Stuckey provided exactly that [the day after the launch](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/openai-ciso-on-atlas/)._

I also find these products pretty unexciting to use. I tried out agent mode and it was like watching a first-time computer user painstakingly learn to use a mouse for the first time. I have yet to find my own use-cases for when this kind of interaction feels useful to me, though I&#39;m not ruling that out.

There was one other detail in the announcement post that caught my eye:

&#62; Website owners can also add [ARIA](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12627856-publishers-and-developers-faq#h_30e9aae450) tags to improve how ChatGPT agent works for their websites in Atlas.

Which links to this:

&#62; ChatGPT Atlas uses ARIA tags---the same labels and roles that support screen readers---to interpret page structure and interactive elements. To improve compatibility, follow [WAI-ARIA best practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) by adding descriptive roles, labels, and states to interactive elements like buttons, menus, and forms. This helps ChatGPT recognize what each element does and interact with your site more accurately.

A neat reminder that AI &#34;agents&#34; share many of the characteristics of assistive technologies, and benefit from the same affordances.

The Atlas user-agent is `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/141.0.0.0 Safari/537.36` \- identical to the user-agent I get for the latest Google Chrome on macOS.

        More than three years ago, based on Paul Butler's <a href="https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/"><i>The problem with bitcoin miners</i></a>, I wrote <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html"><i>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</i></a>. The TL;DR was that the economic life of Bitcoin mining rigs was estimated at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901">16 months</a>, as Moore's law in a competitive ASIC market rapidly generated more power-efficient rigs. But the Bitcoin miners' accounts were using 5-year straight-line depreciation for their rigs, which was significantly increasing their nominal profits.<br />
        <br />
        Below the fold I look at the same problem unfolding in the heart of the AI bubble.<br />
        <span><a name='more'></a></span>
        <br />
        Six months after we started Nvidia we knew over thirty other startups trying to build graphics chips for the PC. A major reason that only ATI survived was that, after the second chip, Nvidia released a better chip every six months like clockwork. I explained the technology that made, and still makes, this possible in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/05/the-dawn-of-nvidias-technology.html"><i>The Dawn Of Nvidia's Technology</i></a>, but in the long term equally important was that the idea of a fixed cadence got built into the company's culture, and this now applies not just to graphics chips but also to <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud">AI chips</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Last year Nvidia, ..., said it would unveil a fresh AI chip every year rather than every couple of years. In March its boss, Jensen Huang, remarked that “when Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn’t give Hoppers away,” referring to Nvidia’s latest chips and their predecessors, respectively.
        </blockquote>
        The systems are estimated to be more than half the capex for a new data center. Much of its opex is power. Just as with mining rigs, the key feature of each successive generation of AI chips is that it is more efficient at using power. But that doesn't mean they use less power, they use more but less per operation. The need for enhanced power distribution and the concomitant cooling is what has prevented new AI systems being installed in legacy data centers. Presumably the next few generations will be compatible with current state of the art data center infrastructure, so they can directly replace their predecessors and thereby reduce costs.<br />
        <br />
        It is often assumed that the majority of the opex of AI platforms goes into training, which is a once per generation cost that can be amortized over the huge number of inference operations needed to answer prompts. But as James O'Donnell and Casey Crownhart report in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/"><i>We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.
        </blockquote>
        So 80-90% of the opex is per-query, which makes improving system efficiency critical to reducing the torrent of cash these platforms are hemorrhaging. Ed Zitron <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/">estimated that</a>:
        <blockquote>
        To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.
        </blockquote>
        This makes Jensen's quip somewhat credible.<br />
        <br />
        A month ago I missed <i>The Economist's</i> discovery of the AI version of <a href="https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/">Paul Butler's Bitcoin post</a>, entitled <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud"><i>The $4trn accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud</i></a>. The cost of these rapidly depreciating assets is huge:<br />
        <blockquote>
        AI revenues and expenditures are likewise a 13-figure affair nowadays. Worldwide spending on AI hardware and software nudged $1trn last year, according to Gartner, a research firm. This is likely to double to $2trn in 2026. Between 2024 and 2026 the five listed AI powerhouses will have splurged over $1trn on capital investments, chiefly AI data centres. A slug will end up with Nvidia and Broadcom, which furnish them and others with AI semiconductors. The duo (combined market capitalisation: $6trn) are together forecast to book almost $1trn in sales over that period.
        </blockquote>
        The platforms haven't been depreciating these assets at <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud">realistic rates</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        biggest customers have in recent times been raising their servers’ lifetimes, reducing depreciation charges in their accounts. Microsoft pushed it up from four to six years in 2022. Alphabet did the same in 2023. Amazon and Oracle changed it from five to six in 2024. And in January Meta moved from five to five and a half years.
        </blockquote>
        The reason for these accounting games is that they make a significant <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud">difference to the bottom line</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Amazon reversed course and moved back to five years for some kit, noting this would cut operating profit in 2025 by $700m, or about 1%, owing to a higher depreciation expense. Given the rapid advances in chipmaking, that seems optimistic. And Amazon’s AI rivals clinging to their elongated depreciation schedules look Pollyannaish. In July Jim Chanos, a veteran short-seller, posted that if the true economic lifespan of Meta’s AI chips is two to three years, then “most of its ‘profits’ are materially overstated.” A recent analysis of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta by Barclays, a bank, estimated that higher depreciation costs would shave 5-10% from their earnings per share.
        </blockquote>
        And thus to their stock price. If they went to a <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud">3-year straight-line depreciation</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        At the five companies’ current ratio of market capitalisation to pre-tax profit, this would amount to a $780bn knock to their combined value. Redo the sums depreciating the servers over two years instead of three and the size of the hit rises to $1.6trn. Take Mr Huang literally, and you get a staggering $4trn, equivalent to one-third of their collective worth.
        </blockquote>
        A big chunk of the AI platforms' investment in the hardware is financed with debt. If the lenders are using a five-year life when valuing the hardware as collateral they will run into trouble too. It is rumored that Macquairie was lending against GPUs using a seven-year life.<br />
        <br />

        But as Paul Butler pointed out, straight-line depreciation over-estimates the value of older but not yet uneconomic assets. I described <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">Butler's graph</a>:
        <blockquote>
        Butler uses historical hash rate data to compute the actual depreciation curves for mining hardware, plotting the percentage of the initial bitcoin production rate against time in quarters for each quarter since Bitcoin's inception. The graph shows that initially (bluest lines), when GPUs were introduced, they stopped producing after about 5 quarters. Recently (magenta-est lines), ASICs last longer, stopping producing after about 4 years. But for the whole of Bitcoin's existence the hardware has depreciated far faster than the GAAP's five year straight line.
        </blockquote>
        But I <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">argued that it was too optimstic</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        He assumes that the ASICs are obsolete when they can no longer keep up with the hash rate so are no longer mining any Bitcoin. That is wrong. ASICs are obsolete when the Bitcoin they mine <i>no longer pay for the electricity they use</i>. The newer ASICs aren't just faster, they also use much less energy per hash. Look again at the depreciation graph, which suggests current ASICs go obsolete after 16 quarters. But <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901">Alex de Vries and Christian Stoll's estimate</a> of 5 quarters to obsolescence is based on comparing the ASIC's production with the cost of their power consumption, which is the correct approach. The curves in the graph are correct out to the 40% line, but then should drop to zero.
        </blockquote>
        Similarly, at some point in the future when the AI platforms realize they need a return on their investments, running systems answering queries that earn less than the cost of the power will no longer make sense and their value will drop precipitously.<br />
        <br />
        If hardware is being used as collateral for a loan the value should represent what it would fetch on the market. Assume Nvidia is on a 2-year cadence. Customers don't get their hardware instantly, so assume that the borrower got theirs 6 months into the 2 years. They default after 1 year,  so the bank is selling hardware  with 6 months left before the next generation starts shipping, and 1 year before a typical customer can get hardware that renders the current hardware almost uneconomic. The lender's 5-year straight-line estimate of value would be 80% of the purchase price. A buyer would likely estimate 20% of the purchase price.<br />
        <br />
        This blog has often cited the excellent work of Arvind Narayanan at Princeton. His colleague Mihir Kshirsagar posted an equally excellent piece on the implications of inadequate depreciation for competition entitled <a href="https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2025/10/15/lifespan-of-ai-chips-the-300-billion-question/"><i>Lifespan of AI Chips: The $300 Billion Question</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        What I have found so far is surprising. It appears that we’re making important decisions about who gets to compete in AI based on financial assumptions that may be systematically overstating the long-run sustainability of the industry by a factor of two.
        </blockquote>
        Kshirsagar has identified inadequate depreciation as a key part of what I have called "<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html">the drug-dealer's algorithm</a>" (<i>the first one's free</i>):<br />
        <blockquote>
        Incumbent coalitions—hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) partnered with their model developers (OpenAI, Anthropic)—can effectively subsidize application-layer pricing during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. This could create advantages that prove insurmountable even when better technology becomes available.<br />
        <br />
        The core issue isn’t whether chips wear out faster than accounting suggests. It’s whether the market structure being formed is fueled by accounting conventions that obscure true long-run economics, allowing incumbent coalitions to establish customer lock-in at the application layer before true costs become visible. In other words, the accounting subsidy creates a window of roughly three to six years where reported costs are artificially low. After that, the overlapping depreciation schedules catch up to operational reality. Here’s why this timing matters: that three-to-six-year window is precisely when the market structure for AI applications is being determined. Customer relationships are being formed. Enterprise integrations are being built. Multi-year contracts are being signed. Switching costs are accumulating. By the time the accounting catches up—when companies face the full weight of replacement costs hitting their income statements—the incumbent coalitions will have already locked in their customer base. The temporary subsidy enables permanent competitive advantage. 
        </blockquote>
        Kshirsagar goes on to examine the effects of the drug-dealers algorithm in considerable detail. I encourage you to read the whole post, although I have a few quibbles:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>He focuses on enterprise use of AI as the platform's business model, and seems to assume that enterprises will find that using AI generates enough value to cover the subsidized cost through the lock-in period. Given the negative productivity impact most enterprises currently report, this is not a safe assumption.</li>
        <li>Even if management's infatuation with AI, and the prospect of firing all their <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/07/the-selling-of-ai.html">annoying employees</a>, results in their being locked in to the AI platform of their choice, they will need to achieve massive productivity gains to be able to afford what the platforms will have to charge to raise the <a href="https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/20252/$2-trillion-in-new-revenue-needed-to-fund-ais-scaling-trend---bain--companys-6th-annual-global-technology-report/">$2T/year in revenue</a> they will need.</li>
        <li>The AI platforms have already figured out that enterprise use isn't likely to generate enough revenue and are pivoting to advertising, affiliate marketing and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/erotica-coming-to-chatgpt-this-year-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman.html">porn</a>.</li>
        <li>There is an elephant in the room, namely the vastly increased attack surface AI provides. For example, we have Benji Edwards' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-models-can-acquire-backdoors-from-surprisingly-few-malicious-documents/"><i>AI models can acquire backdoors from surprisingly few malicious documents</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        researchers from Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute released a preprint research paper suggesting that large language models like the ones that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can develop backdoor vulnerabilities from as few as 250 corrupted documents inserted into their training data.
        </blockquote>
        And David Gerard's <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/10/14/its-trivial-to-prompt-inject-githubs-ai-copilot-chat/"><i>It’s trivial to prompt-inject Github’s AI Copilot Chat</i></a>:
        <blockquote>
        Mayraz’s question was: can we send a pull request — a suggested code fix — that contains a prompt injection? And make the bot spill sensitive user data, like private code or AWS login keys? Yes, we can!<br />
        ...<br />
        Mayraz’s exploit was a rediscovery of an exploit GitHub had already been told about. User 49016 discovered the bug a few months before and reported it on HackerOne. GitHub acknowledged the report and called it a “low risk” issue — “yes, they <i>seriously</i> consider a LLM leaking your private repo contents as a ‘low risk issue’.” (Mayraz’s CVE filing was rated a 9.6.) 49016 reports that GitHub’s fix is rubbish, and “bypassing it took 5 minutes lol.”

        Want an Nvidia B200 GPU accelerator? Buying one on its release in late 2024 would’ve probably cost around $50,000, which is before all the costs associated with plugging it in and switching it on. Yet by early 2025, the same hardware could be rented for around $3.20 an hour. By last month, the B200’s floor price had fallen to $2.80 per hour.

        That is weird. If the economic life of a B200 is 2 years at $2.80/hour it would earn only $49K, or its purchase price.  But Elder explains that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9">it isn't that simple</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        What might be less obvious is that among the hyperscalers — Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Google and Oracle — prices have hardly budged. The result is an ever-widening gap between rates charged by the big-four and a growing number of smaller rivals.<br />
        <br />
        Here’s the same RBC data organised to show relative pricing across all GPUs. The iceberg effect shows how much it’s new entrants driving average rates lower. Meanwhile, for a hyperscaler customers, this month’s bill per GPU will almost always be the same as last month’s bill

        <blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>A lot of pandemic-era Nvidia GPUs will be heading towards Cash Converters having never washed their face.</li>
        <li>The customers attracted by low AI compute costs have yet to show much ability, willingness or inclination to pay more.</li>
        <li>The hyperscalers don’t believe these customers are worth competing for, so have chosen to wait for the discount end of the market to die of insolvency.</li>
        <li>The inevitable data-centre shakeout will kill lots of AI start-ups that can’t afford to pay what compute actually costs.</li>
        <li>We might be overestimating the size of the GPU market if the middle-ground — meaning regular companies that want OpenAI and Anthropic to make their chatbots, summarisation tools and similar AI widgets — turns out to be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce">worth less than $3tn</a>.</li>

        Those are all good points.<br />
        <h3>Update</h3>
        I need to update today's post to cover two important posts I missed:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>Will Lockett's <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7"><i>The AI Bubble Is Far Worse Than We Thought</i></a> from 13<sup>th</sup> October. It describes the size of the debt fuelling the AI platform's tsunami of spending.</li>
        <li>Ed Zitron's <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/"><i>This Is How Much Anthropic and Cursor Spend On Amazon Web Services</i></a> from yesterday. It provides evidence for their vast excess of costs over income.</li>
        </ul>
        Together, they greatly amplify the message that when the IA bubble bursts, the damage will not be confined to the AI platforms, or even to technology stocks, but it will impact the banks and private capital lenders.<br />
        <h4>Will Lockett</h4>
        Lockett starts from an analysis by Julien Garran of MacroStrategy Partnership, pointing to the mismatch between the enormous investments the AI platforms are making and the lack of any sustainable business model to generate the <a href="https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/20252/$2-trillion-in-new-revenue-needed-to-fund-ais-scaling-trend---bain--companys-6th-annual-global-technology-report/">$2T/year in new revenue</a> needed to provide a return.<br />
        <br />
        So far, Garran's analysis is hardly original, <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">but</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Garran used the economic analysis pioneered by economist Knut Wicksell to establish the size of this investing discrepancy, the 2008 bubble, and the dot-com bubble, and that is how he learned that <b>the AI bubble is currently four times the size of the 2008 bubble at its peak!</b>
        </blockquote>
        Lockett asks "<a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">is the AI bubble as connected to the outside world?</a>":<br />
        <blockquote>
        It seems AI companies have been growing through equity financing (selling shares of the company) rather than debt financing (borrowing money). Furthermore, investment seems to be incestuous to the tech industry; for example, OpenAI’s major investors are Microsoft and Nvidia. As such, many believed that the AI bubble is actually relatively isolated from the rest of the economy and therefore might not have as significant an impact on the wider economy when it bursts.
        </blockquote>
        It turns out that a large slice of the bubble spending <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">isn't equity</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Dario Perkins, managing director of global macro at TS Lombard, has found that many AI companies are increasingly using SPVs to raise significant amounts of debt financing off the books. This covers their tracks and obfuscates the debt, making it “look” like the company is running on equity finance instead. Due to this, it is incredibly difficult to get an accurate figure on how much of the AI industry’s expenditure and growth comes from debt — but we know it is a lot!
        </blockquote>
        Even the "on the books" debt <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">is a lot</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Goldman Sachs has found that at least $141 billion of the $500 billion in capital expenses the AI industry has spent so far this year came from debt directly tied to the main corporate body through corporate credit issuances. To give you an idea of how insane that is, the entire AI industry capital expenditure in 2024 was $127 billion. In other words, the AI industry has taken on significantly more debt so far this year than it ever spent in total last year. This also means that we know that about 30% of the AI industry’s annual expenditure for this year came from “on the books” debt.
        </blockquote>
        And there is plenty of <a href="https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7">"off the books" debt</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        We know that Meta is looking to raise $26 billion in debt through an SPV by the end of the year. This one deal equates to 5% of the total AI industry’s capital expenditure for this year.
        </blockquote>
        You have to wonder what collateral is backing this "at least" $167B in debt, and how it is being depreciated.<br />
        <h4>Ed Zitron</h4>
        Some of the AI platforms have non-AI free cash flows that can be diverted to paying the interest on these debts, or that could be if they hadn't already been shoveled into the AI investment cash furnace. But OpenAI, Anthropic and the other pure-play AI platforms don't. In order to pay the interest without needing to raise more equity, they need to be cash flow positive. Zitron has always been skeptical that they can be, for example <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/">writing</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.
        </blockquote>
        Now, Zitron has strong evidence that <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">he was right</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of their AWS billing, I am able to disclose the amounts that AI firms are spending, specifically Anthropic and AI coding company Cursor, <a href="https://www.vincentschmalbach.com/cursor-is-anthropics-largest-customer-and-maxing-out-their-gpus/">its largest customer</a>.<br />
        <br />
        I can exclusively reveal today Anthropic’s spending on Amazon Web Services for the entirety of 2024, and for every month in 2025 up until September, and that that Anthropic’s spend on compute far exceeds that previously reported. 
        </blockquote>
        Zitron can <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">confirm that</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Anthropic has spent more than 100% of its estimated revenue (based on reporting in the last year) on Amazon Web Services, spending $2.66 billion on compute on an estimated $2.55 billion in revenue.
        </blockquote>
        And what about <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">Cursor?</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Additionally, Cursor’s Amazon Web Services bills more than doubled from $6.2 million in May 2025 to $12.6 million in June 2025, exacerbating a cash crunch that began when Anthropic introduced Priority Service Tiers, an aggressive rent-seeking measure that begun what I call the Subprime AI Crisis, where model providers begin jacking up the prices on their previously subsidized rates.<br />
        <br />
        Although Cursor obtains the majority of its compute from Anthropic — with AWS contributing a relatively small amount, and likely also taking care of other parts of its business — the data seen reveals an overall direction of travel, where the costs of compute <i>only keep on going up</i>. 
        </blockquote>
        Last year Anthropic likely spent more than <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/"><i>ten times its revenue</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        In February of this year, The information reported that Anthropic burned $5.6 billion in 2024, and made somewhere between $400 million and $600 million in revenue<br />
        ...<br />
        I can confirm from a source with direct knowledge of billing that Anthropic spent $1.35 billion on Amazon Web Services in 2024, and has already spent $2.66 billion on Amazon Web Services through the end of September.<br />
        <br />
        Assuming that Anthropic made $600 million in revenue, this means that Anthropic spent $6.2 billion in 2024, leaving $4.85 billion in costs unaccounted for.
        </blockquote>
        Zitron notes that Anthropic is "<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">making it up in volume</a>":<br />
        <blockquote>
        Based on what I have been party to, the more successful Anthropic becomes, the more its services cost. <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue-with-an-ai-booster/#if-you-plotted-the-curve-of-how-the-cost-of-inference-has-been-falling-over-time-%E2%80%94-false-the-cost-of-inference-has-gone-up-over-time">The cost of inference is clearly increasing for customers</a>, but based on its escalating monthly costs, the cost of inference appears to be high for Anthropic too, though it’s impossible to tell how much of its compute is based on training versus running inference.
        </blockquote>
        While it is true that training these very large models is expensive, it is a one-time cost to be amortized against the huge number of inferences made against the trained model. Alas, the huge number is so huge that it <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/">dominates the one-time cost</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference. 
        </blockquote>
        Which explains Zitron's <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/">observation that</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        these costs seem to increase with the amount of money Anthropic makes, meaning that the current pricing of both subscriptions and API access seems unprofitable, and must increase dramatically — from my calculations, a 100% price increase might work, but good luck retaining every single customer and their customers too! — for this company to ever become sustainable. 
        </blockquote>
        This confirms my prediction of price increases in June's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html"><i>The Back Of The AI Envelope</i></a>.<br />
        <br />
        Zitron's post is long, detailed and very much worth reading. Go and read it.<br />

More than three years ago, based on Paul Butler&#39;s [_The problem with bitcoin miners_](https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/), I wrote [_Generally Accepted Accounting Principles_](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html). The TL;DR was that the economic life of Bitcoin mining rigs was estimated at [16 months](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901), as Moore&#39;s law in a competitive ASIC market rapidly generated more power-efficient rigs. But the Bitcoin miners&#39; accounts were using 5-year straight-line depreciation for their rigs, which was significantly increasing their nominal profits.

Below the fold I look at the same problem unfolding in the heart of the AI bubble.

Six months after we started Nvidia we knew over thirty other startups trying to build graphics chips for the PC. A major reason that only ATI survived was that, after the second chip, Nvidia released a better chip every six months like clockwork. I explained the technology that made, and still makes, this possible in [_The Dawn Of Nvidia&#39;s Technology_](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/05/the-dawn-of-nvidias-technology.html), but in the long term equally important was that the idea of a fixed cadence got built into the company&#39;s culture, and this now applies not just to graphics chips but also to [AI chips](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud):

&#62; Last year Nvidia, ..., said it would unveil a fresh AI chip every year rather than every couple of years. In March its boss, Jensen Huang, remarked that “when Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn’t give Hoppers away,” referring to Nvidia’s latest chips and their predecessors, respectively.

The systems are estimated to be more than half the capex for a new data center. Much of its opex is power. Just as with mining rigs, the key feature of each successive generation of AI chips is that it is more efficient at using power. But that doesn&#39;t mean they use less power, they use more but less per operation. The need for enhanced power distribution and the concomitant cooling is what has prevented new AI systems being installed in legacy data centers. Presumably the next few generations will be compatible with current state of the art data center infrastructure, so they can directly replace their predecessors and thereby reduce costs.

It is often assumed that the majority of the opex of AI platforms goes into training, which is a once per generation cost that can be amortized over the huge number of inference operations needed to answer prompts. But as James O&#39;Donnell and Casey Crownhart report in [_We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard._](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/):

&#62; As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.

So 80-90% of the opex is per-query, which makes improving system efficiency critical to reducing the torrent of cash these platforms are hemorrhaging. Ed Zitron [estimated that](https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/):

&#62; To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.

This makes Jensen&#39;s quip somewhat credible.

A month ago I missed _The Economist&#39;s_ discovery of the AI version of [Paul Butler&#39;s Bitcoin post](https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/), entitled [_The $4trn accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud_](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud). The cost of these rapidly depreciating assets is huge:

&#62; AI revenues and expenditures are likewise a 13-figure affair nowadays. Worldwide spending on AI hardware and software nudged $1trn last year, according to Gartner, a research firm. This is likely to double to $2trn in 2026. Between 2024 and 2026 the five listed AI powerhouses will have splurged over $1trn on capital investments, chiefly AI data centres. A slug will end up with Nvidia and Broadcom, which furnish them and others with AI semiconductors. The duo (combined market capitalisation: $6trn) are together forecast to book almost $1trn in sales over that period.

The platforms haven&#39;t been depreciating these assets at [realistic rates](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud):

&#62; biggest customers have in recent times been raising their servers’ lifetimes, reducing depreciation charges in their accounts. Microsoft pushed it up from four to six years in 2022. Alphabet did the same in 2023. Amazon and Oracle changed it from five to six in 2024. And in January Meta moved from five to five and a half years.

The reason for these accounting games is that they make a significant [difference to the bottom line](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud):

&#62; Amazon reversed course and moved back to five years for some kit, noting this would cut operating profit in 2025 by $700m, or about 1%, owing to a higher depreciation expense. Given the rapid advances in chipmaking, that seems optimistic. And Amazon’s AI rivals clinging to their elongated depreciation schedules look Pollyannaish. In July Jim Chanos, a veteran short-seller, posted that if the true economic lifespan of Meta’s AI chips is two to three years, then “most of its ‘profits’ are materially overstated.” A recent analysis of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta by Barclays, a bank, estimated that higher depreciation costs would shave 5-10% from their earnings per share.

And thus to their stock price. If they went to a [3-year straight-line depreciation](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud):

&#62; At the five companies’ current ratio of market capitalisation to pre-tax profit, this would amount to a $780bn knock to their combined value. Redo the sums depreciating the servers over two years instead of three and the size of the hit rises to $1.6trn. Take Mr Huang literally, and you get a staggering $4trn, equivalent to one-third of their collective worth.

A big chunk of the AI platforms&#39; investment in the hardware is financed with debt. If the lenders are using a five-year life when valuing the hardware as collateral they will run into trouble too. It is rumored that Macquairie was lending against GPUs using a seven-year life.

But as Paul Butler pointed out, straight-line depreciation over-estimates the value of older but not yet uneconomic assets. I described [Butler&#39;s graph](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html):

&#62; Butler uses historical hash rate data to compute the actual depreciation curves for mining hardware, plotting the percentage of the initial bitcoin production rate against time in quarters for each quarter since Bitcoin&#39;s inception. The graph shows that initially (bluest lines), when GPUs were introduced, they stopped producing after about 5 quarters. Recently (magenta-est lines), ASICs last longer, stopping producing after about 4 years. But for the whole of Bitcoin&#39;s existence the hardware has depreciated far faster than the GAAP&#39;s five year straight line.

But I [argued that it was too optimstic](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html):

&#62; He assumes that the ASICs are obsolete when they can no longer keep up with the hash rate so are no longer mining any Bitcoin. That is wrong. ASICs are obsolete when the Bitcoin they mine _no longer pay for the electricity they use_. The newer ASICs aren&#39;t just faster, they also use much less energy per hash. Look again at the depreciation graph, which suggests current ASICs go obsolete after 16 quarters. But [Alex de Vries and Christian Stoll&#39;s estimate](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901) of 5 quarters to obsolescence is based on comparing the ASIC&#39;s production with the cost of their power consumption, which is the correct approach. The curves in the graph are correct out to the 40% line, but then should drop to zero.

Similarly, at some point in the future when the AI platforms realize they need a return on their investments, running systems answering queries that earn less than the cost of the power will no longer make sense and their value will drop precipitously.

If hardware is being used as collateral for a loan the value should represent what it would fetch on the market. Assume Nvidia is on a 2-year cadence. Customers don&#39;t get their hardware instantly, so assume that the borrower got theirs 6 months into the 2 years. They default after 1 year, so the bank is selling hardware with 6 months left before the next generation starts shipping, and 1 year before a typical customer can get hardware that renders the current hardware almost uneconomic. The lender&#39;s 5-year straight-line estimate of value would be 80% of the purchase price. A buyer would likely estimate 20% of the purchase price.

This blog has often cited the excellent work of Arvind Narayanan at Princeton. His colleague Mihir Kshirsagar posted an equally excellent piece on the implications of inadequate depreciation for competition entitled [_Lifespan of AI Chips: The $300 Billion Question_](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2025/10/15/lifespan-of-ai-chips-the-300-billion-question/):

&#62; What I have found so far is surprising. It appears that we’re making important decisions about who gets to compete in AI based on financial assumptions that may be systematically overstating the long-run sustainability of the industry by a factor of two.

Kshirsagar has identified inadequate depreciation as a key part of what I have called &#34; [the drug-dealer&#39;s algorithm](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html)&#34; ( _the first one&#39;s free_):

&#62; Incumbent coalitions—hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) partnered with their model developers (OpenAI, Anthropic)—can effectively subsidize application-layer pricing during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. This could create advantages that prove insurmountable even when better technology becomes available.
&#62;
&#62; The core issue isn’t whether chips wear out faster than accounting suggests. It’s whether the market structure being formed is fueled by accounting conventions that obscure true long-run economics, allowing incumbent coalitions to establish customer lock-in at the application layer before true costs become visible. In other words, the accounting subsidy creates a window of roughly three to six years where reported costs are artificially low. After that, the overlapping depreciation schedules catch up to operational reality. Here’s why this timing matters: that three-to-six-year window is precisely when the market structure for AI applications is being determined. Customer relationships are being formed. Enterprise integrations are being built. Multi-year contracts are being signed. Switching costs are accumulating. By the time the accounting catches up—when companies face the full weight of replacement costs hitting their income statements—the incumbent coalitions will have already locked in their customer base. The temporary subsidy enables permanent competitive advantage.

Kshirsagar goes on to examine the effects of the drug-dealers algorithm in considerable detail. I encourage you to read the whole post, although I have a few quibbles:

- He focuses on enterprise use of AI as the platform&#39;s business model, and seems to assume that enterprises will find that using AI generates enough value to cover the subsidized cost through the lock-in period. Given the negative productivity impact most enterprises currently report, this is not a safe assumption.
- Even if management&#39;s infatuation with AI, and the prospect of firing all their [annoying employees](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/07/the-selling-of-ai.html), results in their being locked in to the AI platform of their choice, they will need to achieve massive productivity gains to be able to afford what the platforms will have to charge to raise the [$2T/year in revenue](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/20252/$2-trillion-in-new-revenue-needed-to-fund-ais-scaling-trend---bain--companys-6th-annual-global-technology-report/) they will need.
- The AI platforms have already figured out that enterprise use isn&#39;t likely to generate enough revenue and are pivoting to advertising, affiliate marketing and [porn](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/erotica-coming-to-chatgpt-this-year-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman.html).
- There is an elephant in the room, namely the vastly increased attack surface AI provides. For example, we have Benji Edwards&#39; [_AI models can acquire backdoors from surprisingly few malicious documents_](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-models-can-acquire-backdoors-from-surprisingly-few-malicious-documents/):



  &#62; researchers from Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute released a preprint research paper suggesting that large language models like the ones that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can develop backdoor vulnerabilities from as few as 250 corrupted documents inserted into their training data.


  And David Gerard&#39;s [_It’s trivial to prompt-inject Github’s AI Copilot Chat_](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/10/14/its-trivial-to-prompt-inject-githubs-ai-copilot-chat/):


  &#62; Mayraz’s question was: can we send a pull request — a suggested code fix — that contains a prompt injection? And make the bot spill sensitive user data, like private code or AWS login keys? Yes, we can!
  &#62;
  &#62; ...
  &#62;
  &#62; Mayraz’s exploit was a rediscovery of an exploit GitHub had already been told about. User 49016 discovered the bug a few months before and reported it on HackerOne. GitHub acknowledged the report and called it a “low risk” issue — “yes, they _seriously_ consider a LLM leaking your private repo contents as a ‘low risk issue’.” (Mayraz’s CVE filing was rated a 9.6.) 49016 reports that GitHub’s fix is rubbish, and “bypassing it took 5 minutes lol.”

  &#62; a $4,000 desktop AI computer that wraps one petaflop of computing performance and 128GB of unified memory into a form factor small enough to sit on a desk.
  &#62;
  &#62; ...
  &#62;
  &#62; Nvidia’s Spark reportedly includes enough memory to run larger-than-typical AI models for local tasks, with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models containing up to 70 billion parameters without requiring remote infrastructure. Potential uses include running larger open-weights language models and media synthesis models such as AI image generators.


  The system is the tiny gold box in the image. It is based on Blackwell.

Related to Kshirsagar&#39;s analysis of the effectiveness of lock-in is Bryce Elder&#39;s [_What GPU pricing can tell us about how the AI bubble will pop_](https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9):

&#62; One odd thing about AI equipment is that it’s very expensive to buy and very cheap to rent.
&#62;
&#62; Want an Nvidia B200 GPU accelerator? Buying one on its release in late 2024 would’ve probably cost around $50,000, which is before all the costs associated with plugging it in and switching it on. Yet by early 2025, the same hardware could be rented for around $3.20 an hour. By last month, the B200’s floor price had fallen to $2.80 per hour.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0ZwZ2d1tfF5doM7EiLEMtVmQf6QmYJWV7zIJkLQYQtcpNOl7I8yCxnF4x9ul869SUbNSSsMB6A9Kl6P838Sz8z2wOqkv0_JW2NRlxXZInL5ogOIGBn2mrgt5bvRyIMYyLm6fHYz1HlAbVnNayz-AZZur5g3vjB88mYNs26gB2i-wnftL2MbCdK-E3G99Y/w200-h129/RelativeRental.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0ZwZ2d1tfF5doM7EiLEMtVmQf6QmYJWV7zIJkLQYQtcpNOl7I8yCxnF4x9ul869SUbNSSsMB6A9Kl6P838Sz8z2wOqkv0_JW2NRlxXZInL5ogOIGBn2mrgt5bvRyIMYyLm6fHYz1HlAbVnNayz-AZZur5g3vjB88mYNs26gB2i-wnftL2MbCdK-E3G99Y/s1586/RelativeRental.png)[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9)
That is weird. If the economic life of a B200 is 2 years at $2.80/hour it would earn only $49K, or its purchase price. But Elder explains that [it isn&#39;t that simple](https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9):

&#62; What might be less obvious is that among the hyperscalers — Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Google and Oracle — prices have hardly budged. The result is an ever-widening gap between rates charged by the big-four and a growing number of smaller rivals.
&#62;
&#62; Here’s the same RBC data organised to show relative pricing across all GPUs. The iceberg effect shows how much it’s new entrants driving average rates lower. Meanwhile, for a hyperscaler customers, this month’s bill per GPU will almost always be the same as last month’s bill

Elder ends with a set of [possible conclusions](https://www.ft.com/content/d49707ae-5d6b-473e-9e2b-487d318e6fe9):

&#62; - A lot of pandemic-era Nvidia GPUs will be heading towards Cash Converters having never washed their face.
&#62; - The customers attracted by low AI compute costs have yet to show much ability, willingness or inclination to pay more.
&#62; - The hyperscalers don’t believe these customers are worth competing for, so have chosen to wait for the discount end of the market to die of insolvency.
&#62; - The inevitable data-centre shakeout will kill lots of AI start-ups that can’t afford to pay what compute actually costs.
&#62; - We might be overestimating the size of the GPU market if the middle-ground — meaning regular companies that want OpenAI and Anthropic to make their chatbots, summarisation tools and similar AI widgets — turns out to be [worth less than $3tn](https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce).

Those are all good points.

### Update

I need to update today&#39;s post to cover two important posts I missed:

- Will Lockett&#39;s [_The AI Bubble Is Far Worse Than We Thought_](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7) from 13th October. It describes the size of the debt fuelling the AI platform&#39;s tsunami of spending.
- Ed Zitron&#39;s [_This Is How Much Anthropic and Cursor Spend On Amazon Web Services_](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/) from yesterday. It provides evidence for their vast excess of costs over income.

Together, they greatly amplify the message that when the IA bubble bursts, the damage will not be confined to the AI platforms, or even to technology stocks, but it will impact the banks and private capital lenders.

#### Will Lockett

Lockett starts from an analysis by Julien Garran of MacroStrategy Partnership, pointing to the mismatch between the enormous investments the AI platforms are making and the lack of any sustainable business model to generate the [$2T/year in new revenue](https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/20252/$2-trillion-in-new-revenue-needed-to-fund-ais-scaling-trend---bain--companys-6th-annual-global-technology-report/) needed to provide a return.

So far, Garran&#39;s analysis is hardly original, [but](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7):

&#62; Garran used the economic analysis pioneered by economist Knut Wicksell to establish the size of this investing discrepancy, the 2008 bubble, and the dot-com bubble, and that is how he learned that **the AI bubble is currently four times the size of the 2008 bubble at its peak!**

Lockett asks &#34; [is the AI bubble as connected to the outside world?](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7)&#34;:

&#62; It seems AI companies have been growing through equity financing (selling shares of the company) rather than debt financing (borrowing money). Furthermore, investment seems to be incestuous to the tech industry; for example, OpenAI’s major investors are Microsoft and Nvidia. As such, many believed that the AI bubble is actually relatively isolated from the rest of the economy and therefore might not have as significant an impact on the wider economy when it bursts.

It turns out that a large slice of the bubble spending [isn&#39;t equity](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7):

&#62; Dario Perkins, managing director of global macro at TS Lombard, has found that many AI companies are increasingly using SPVs to raise significant amounts of debt financing off the books. This covers their tracks and obfuscates the debt, making it “look” like the company is running on equity finance instead. Due to this, it is incredibly difficult to get an accurate figure on how much of the AI industry’s expenditure and growth comes from debt — but we know it is a lot!

Even the &#34;on the books&#34; debt [is a lot](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7):

&#62; Goldman Sachs has found that at least $141 billion of the $500 billion in capital expenses the AI industry has spent so far this year came from debt directly tied to the main corporate body through corporate credit issuances. To give you an idea of how insane that is, the entire AI industry capital expenditure in 2024 was $127 billion. In other words, the AI industry has taken on significantly more debt so far this year than it ever spent in total last year. This also means that we know that about 30% of the AI industry’s annual expenditure for this year came from “on the books” debt.

And there is plenty of [&#34;off the books&#34; debt](https://wlockett.medium.com/the-ai-bubble-is-far-worse-than-we-thought-f070a70a90d7):

&#62; We know that Meta is looking to raise $26 billion in debt through an SPV by the end of the year. This one deal equates to 5% of the total AI industry’s capital expenditure for this year.

You have to wonder what collateral is backing this &#34;at least&#34; $167B in debt, and how it is being depreciated.

#### Ed Zitron

Some of the AI platforms have non-AI free cash flows that can be diverted to paying the interest on these debts, or that could be if they hadn&#39;t already been shoveled into the AI investment cash furnace. But OpenAI, Anthropic and the other pure-play AI platforms don&#39;t. In order to pay the interest without needing to raise more equity, they need to be cash flow positive. Zitron has always been skeptical that they can be, for example [writing](https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/):

&#62; To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.

Now, Zitron has strong evidence that [he was right](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of their AWS billing, I am able to disclose the amounts that AI firms are spending, specifically Anthropic and AI coding company Cursor, [its largest customer](https://www.vincentschmalbach.com/cursor-is-anthropics-largest-customer-and-maxing-out-their-gpus/).
&#62;
&#62; I can exclusively reveal today Anthropic’s spending on Amazon Web Services for the entirety of 2024, and for every month in 2025 up until September, and that that Anthropic’s spend on compute far exceeds that previously reported.

Zitron can [confirm that](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; Anthropic has spent more than 100% of its estimated revenue (based on reporting in the last year) on Amazon Web Services, spending $2.66 billion on compute on an estimated $2.55 billion in revenue.

And what about [Cursor?](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; Additionally, Cursor’s Amazon Web Services bills more than doubled from $6.2 million in May 2025 to $12.6 million in June 2025, exacerbating a cash crunch that began when Anthropic introduced Priority Service Tiers, an aggressive rent-seeking measure that begun what I call the Subprime AI Crisis, where model providers begin jacking up the prices on their previously subsidized rates.
&#62;
&#62; Although Cursor obtains the majority of its compute from Anthropic — with AWS contributing a relatively small amount, and likely also taking care of other parts of its business — the data seen reveals an overall direction of travel, where the costs of compute _only keep on going up_.

Last year Anthropic likely spent more than [_ten times its revenue_](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; In February of this year, The information reported that Anthropic burned $5.6 billion in 2024, and made somewhere between $400 million and $600 million in revenue
&#62;
&#62; ...
&#62;
&#62; I can confirm from a source with direct knowledge of billing that Anthropic spent $1.35 billion on Amazon Web Services in 2024, and has already spent $2.66 billion on Amazon Web Services through the end of September.
&#62;
&#62; Assuming that Anthropic made $600 million in revenue, this means that Anthropic spent $6.2 billion in 2024, leaving $4.85 billion in costs unaccounted for.

Zitron notes that Anthropic is &#34; [making it up in volume](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/)&#34;:

&#62; Based on what I have been party to, the more successful Anthropic becomes, the more its services cost. [The cost of inference is clearly increasing for customers](https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue-with-an-ai-booster/#if-you-plotted-the-curve-of-how-the-cost-of-inference-has-been-falling-over-time-%E2%80%94-false-the-cost-of-inference-has-gone-up-over-time), but based on its escalating monthly costs, the cost of inference appears to be high for Anthropic too, though it’s impossible to tell how much of its compute is based on training versus running inference.

While it is true that training these very large models is expensive, it is a one-time cost to be amortized against the huge number of inferences made against the trained model. Alas, the huge number is so huge that it [dominates the one-time cost](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/):

&#62; As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI’s energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It’s now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.

Which explains Zitron&#39;s [observation that](https://www.wheresyoured.at/costs/):

&#62; these costs seem to increase with the amount of money Anthropic makes, meaning that the current pricing of both subscriptions and API access seems unprofitable, and must increase dramatically — from my calculations, a 100% price increase might work, but good luck retaining every single customer and their customers too! — for this company to ever become sustainable.

This confirms my prediction of price increases in June&#39;s [_The Back Of The AI Envelope_](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/06/the-back-of-ai-envelope.html).

Zitron&#39;s post is long, detailed and very much worth reading. Go and read it.</source:markdown>

Security requires boundaries, but LLMs dissolve boundaries. \[...\]
&#62;
&#62; Poisoned states generate poisoned outputs, which poison future states. Try to summarize the conversation history? The summary includes the injection. Clear the cache to remove the poison? Lose all context. Keep the cache for continuity? Keep the contamination. Stateful systems can’t forget attacks, and so memory becomes a liability. Adversaries can craft inputs that corrupt future outputs.

        <p>I’m reposting <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye" title="@mhoye@mastodon.social">@mhoye</a>’s brilliant answers to <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/public-consultations/help-define-next-chapter-canadas-ai-leadership">a consultation</a> on Canada’s “AI leadership”. (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye/115389752400985454">Source</a>)</p>
        
        <p>The answers apply to all countries, needless to say.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-efforts-are-needed-to-attract-develop-and-retain-top-ai-talent-across-research-industry-and-the-public-sector">What efforts are needed to attract, develop and retain top AI talent across research, industry and the public sector?</h2>
        
        <p>Universal basic income. Excellent health care. Well-funded, accessible universities. Affordable housing. Clean, safe streets achieved by housing the homeless and sheltering and treating the addicted and mentally ill instead of punishing them. Thriving artistic communities in welcoming, multicultural cities. Progressive pricing for the fundamental necessities of life, like energy and shelter.</p>
        
        <p>Any computer can be operated remotely, over any distance, from any other computer. I&rsquo;m doing that right now by filling out this form. You&rsquo;re doing it right now by reading what I&rsquo;ve typed. Where the hardware is plugged in doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. If we want to foster and retain talented researchers, practitioners and public administrators in Canada, then we need to build communities where young people starting their careers can afford to live, where people growing their careers want to live, and where people in the prime of their careers are happy to live.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-are-the-key-barriers-to-ai-adoption-and-how-can-government-and-industry-work-together-to-accelerate-responsible-uptake">What are the key barriers to AI adoption, and how can government and industry work together to accelerate responsible uptake?</h2>
        
        <p>Right now the key barrier to AI adoption is that the people pushing it the hardest are absolutely the least trustworthy people on the planet, with a small army of epistemologically-adrift FOMO-addled C-levels rolling up fast behind them, and it&rsquo;s being pushed into products and people&rsquo;s working processes with no regard to utility or productivity at all. Right now, the overarching purpose of large-model AI is not &ldquo;improved productivity&rdquo; or &ldquo;reduced error rates&rdquo;, it is consuming enough computing resources, through whatever means necessary, that demand for computing stays high enough that the sector can keep their historic high-double-digit growth and returns going, and avoid turning into a commodified utility. But real-world uptake in most of these nonviable scenarios is close to zero and compute as a commodified uitility is where this is going.</p>
        
        <p>Accelerating <em>responsible</em> uptake means a measured approach, using consentfully obtained and carefully curated data to accomplish empirically sound and morally justifiable goals without freeing any person or organization using them from accountability for their actions. This means legal and regulatory frameworks with spine and teeth that understand what safe and consentful mean and impose meaningful costs for failing to meet those standards, and it means investing in historically-undervalued areas like criticism, curation and library sciences as foundational skillsets.</p>
        
        <p>When people depend on their tools – not just use but depend – then the liability avoidance that is absolutely endemic in computing is completely unacceptable. Car companies are simply not permitted to say, if it breaks you can keep both pieces. And it is <em>the imposition of liability</em> that has driven almost all of the modern innovations in automotive quality and safety. AI, and tech in general, needs those constrains in order to thrive.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-needs-to-be-put-in-place-so-canada-can-grow-globally-competitive-ai-companies-while-retaining-ownership-ip-and-economic-sovereignty">What needs to be put in place so Canada can grow globally competitive AI companies while retaining ownership, IP and economic sovereignty?</h2>
        
        <p>Again, I am begging you to understand two things: that any computer anywhere in the world can be operated remotely from any other computer anywhere in the world, and that landlords are a dead weight loss to society.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to foster Canadian innovation and champion Canadian companies, any approach to this that involves business incentives and lets the rentier class thrive is – inevitably, mathematically – a race to the bottom.</p>
        
        <p>If you want a new Renaissance, you have to build the new Vienna.</p>
        
        <p>If you want innovative new technologies to exist, you <em>need</em> to create communities where it is safe to fail. You need to create a society where the opportunity to, the ability to, and the tools to experiment are not the sole domain of already comfortable and already privileged. We know what those experiments look like already, they look like Mark Zuckerberg spending eighty billion dollars on the Metaverse and another eighty billion dollars on pretend chatbot friends and it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all and nobody cares.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to be the place that people go to build the future, you have to bet on people and build a place they&rsquo;ll believe is worth living in while they try to build that future.</p>
        
        <p>Invest in the arts, invest in the culture, invest in affordable housing and health care and tax the rentier class to fund those investments.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-can-canada-better-connect-ai-research-with-commercialization-to-meet-strategic-business-needs">How can Canada better connect AI research with commercialization to meet strategic business needs?</h2>
        
        <p>This is a waste of time and effort.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;Strategic business needs&rdquo; are near-term problems whose contours and desired outcomes are known, where the remaining questions are about effective execution. Research is a long-term exploration whose results are always uncertain, but that sometimes pay off in wholly unexpected ways, even creating wholly unexpected markets.</p>
        
        <p>When the microwave was invented, not only was there no market for microwaves, but every single kitchen in the world already had a way to heat up water in it. It would have been the easiest thing in the world to say, what&rsquo;s the point of that, get back to work on stuff that matters.</p>
        
        <p>Focusing on the commercialization of research is the absolute latest part of the process. If you want real innovation, fund speculation. When something interesting comes of it, you&rsquo;ll get the commercialization for free in a few years.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-lessons-can-we-learn-from-countries-that-are-successful-at-investment-attraction-in-ai-and-tech-both-from-domestic-sources-and-from-foreign-capital">What lessons can we learn from countries that are successful at investment attraction in AI and tech, both from domestic sources and from foreign capital?</h2>
        
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        
        <p>Right now, we can nothing from countries that are funding their own democratic, economic and ecological destruction by spending billion on circular investments into bubble markets without a real customer in sight, weaponizing automation against their working and minority classes and building vast data warehouses that will demand more electricity and water than their entire regions have available while driving the citizen&rsquo;s cost of both through the roof.</p>
        
        <p>We can learn nothing from them except how not to approach it and what not to do.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-can-canada-build-public-trust-in-ai-technologies-while-addressing-the-risks-they-present-what-are-the-most-important-things-to-do-to-build-confidence">How can Canada build public trust in AI technologies while addressing the risks they present? What are the most important things to do to build confidence?</h2>
        
        <p>Consentfully obtained, accountably auditable training data, transparent (and open source) training techniques, and most importantly: liability.</p>
        
        <p>Most of our debates about freedom and safety are framed in terms of &ldquo;freedom to&rdquo;, and the arguments are about the limitations on those freedoms. If you&rsquo;re luckier than me, those conversations might even involve &ldquo;freedom from&rdquo;.</p>
        
        <p>But what if we lived in a society where that wasn&rsquo;t enough? Where government had a positive obligation to not just permit freedom to, but defend the possibility of? To mandate and enforce standards saying you must be free from the possibility of specific kinds of failure?</p>
        
        <p>We already have that for cars, of course.</p>
        
        <p>The full text of CRC c.1038, the Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations section of the Consolidated Regulations of Canada, runs a full megabyte of text. The Ontario Provincial Standards for Roads &amp; Public Works is eight huge tomes and the first of them, General And Construction Specifications, is 1358 pages long. They detail – in <em>excruciating</em> detail – not just how the roads you&rsquo;ll be driving on must be built, illuminated, made safe and maintained, but how those standards will be verified, audited and enforced.</p>
        
        <p>Cars and roads built to these standards don&rsquo;t so much enable freedom of motion and freedom from harm as they delimit in exacting detail on what roads, at what speeds and under what circumstances people must <em>be free from</em> the possibility of specific kinds of harm, where their motion must be free from the possibility of specific kinds of restriction or risk.</p>
        
        <p>The amount of comparable legislation around AI is, I believe, zero.</p>
        
        <p>Canada could building public trust in AI by defining, not just what confidence could mean, but what a positive defence of that confidence and reliability must look like. By defining not just what trustworthiness means, but what specific possibilities of specific harm that trustworthiness means you are free from the possibility of.</p>
        
        <p>That might help.</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-skills-are-required-for-a-modern-digital-economy-and-how-can-canada-best-support-their-development-and-deployment-in-the-workforce">What skills are required for a modern, digital economy, and how can Canada best support their development and deployment in the workforce?</h2>
        
        <p>Respectfully, your real choices here are to either invest comprehensively in public education at the grade school, secondary and college/university/trades levels, or get some posters printed and pretend they&rsquo;ll accomplish anything.</p>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;d rather you invest comprehensively in public education.</p>
        
        <p>(Shoutout to <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@grimalkina" title="@grimalkina@mastodon.social">@grimalkina</a> on this one.)</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-can-canada-do-to-ensure-equitable-access-to-ai-literacy-across-regions-demographics-and-socioeconomic-groups">What can Canada do to ensure equitable access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups?</h2>
        
        <p>There&rsquo;s a famous metric in sociology about the effectiveness of social interventions in education called the &ldquo;hamburger metric&rdquo; – that is, if your social intervention can&rsquo;t be shown, decisively, to be more cost-effective at improving a child&rsquo;s academic outcomes than feeding them a hamburger, you should skip the intervention and feed them the hamburger.</p>
        
        <p>Canada can ensure equitable access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups by investing equally in access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups.</p>
        
        <p>Crazy, I know, but &ldquo;every student has a clean, warm classroom in a clean warm community with clean warm food, shelter and clean running water&rdquo; will do it.</p>
        
        <h2 id="which-infrastructure-gaps-compute-data-connectivity-are-holding-back-ai-innovation-in-canada-and-what-is-stopping-canadian-firms-from-building-sovereign-infrastructure-to-address-them">Which infrastructure gaps (compute, data, connectivity) are holding back AI innovation in Canada, and what is stopping Canadian firms from building sovereign infrastructure to address them?</h2>
        
        <p>Let&rsquo;s be real here, you&rsquo;re not actually going to do anything about this country&rsquo;s insane telco trigopoly.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-can-we-ensure-equitable-access-to-ai-infrastructure-across-regions-sectors-and-users-researchers-start-ups-smes">How can we ensure equitable access to AI infrastructure across regions, sectors and users (researchers, start-ups, SMEs)?</h2>
        
        <p>Another thing we can be real about is this: Canada already has two pieces of parallel infrastructure in place that provides equitable access to information across regions, sectors and users, available to every facet and lost geographic corner of Canadian society. They&rsquo;re the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Canada Post.</p>
        
        <p>The hardware is cheap and you can put it anywhere, so put it where we have places that already host hardware. Payment and delivery systems can be anywhere, and we&rsquo;ve already got them everywhere. If you want equitable access to technology infrastructure and information, so people can start businesses that leverage AI tools from anywhere to anywhere, across Canada then start by leveraging our existing nationwide infrastructure, as a country, to do exactly that:</p>
        
        <p>The CBC should grow to become a citizens&rsquo; web hosting service and Canada Post should become a bank.</p>
        
        <h2 id="how-can-canada-strengthen-cybersecurity-and-safeguard-critical-infrastructure-data-and-models-in-the-age-of-ai">How can Canada strengthen cybersecurity and safeguard critical infrastructure, data and models in the age of AI?</h2>
        
        <p>Cybersecurity has approximately nothing to do with AI.</p>
        
        <p>If breach insurance companies declared today that your insurance was void if your software wasn&rsquo;t kept up to date, around 90% of cybersecurity breaches would end tomorrow. If they said your insurance was null and void if you didn&rsquo;t parameterize your SQL, injection attacks would end tomorrow.</p>
        
        <p>The recent Joint Cybersecurity Advisory from basically every intelligence agency in the Western world that came out last month warning about pervasive Chinese attacks and their success in achieving persistent access, had nothing at all to do with AI. If you go down the list of vulnerabilities being exploited there&rsquo;s nothing exotic or even interesting in it. Nothing, no zero days, no supply interdiction, no AI, no magic future technology from our ephemeral robot overloads, it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;companies did not patch well-known CVEs on time&rdquo;, and those CVEs are all &ldquo;programmer did not sanitise their inputs.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>This industry – and this country, and this world - are nowhere near the point where exotic knowledge or tools or magic are required to make huge progress on the cybersecurity front. This industry doesn&rsquo;t need MRI machines or mRNA vaccines or even penicillin. We need people to wash their hands. Let&rsquo;s start with that. Maybe if we&rsquo;re lucky we can even get people to wash their hands with soap. But that&rsquo;s where we are. People need to wash their damn hands.</p>

      <source:markdown># 2025-10-20 AI Canada

I’m reposting [@mhoye](https://mastodon.social/@mhoye &#34;@mhoye@mastodon.social&#34;)’s brilliant answers to [a consultation](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/public-consultations/help-define-next-chapter-canadas-ai-leadership) on Canada’s “AI leadership”. ( [Source](https://mastodon.social/@mhoye/115389752400985454))

The answers apply to all countries, needless to say.

## What efforts are needed to attract, develop and retain top AI talent across research, industry and the public sector?

Universal basic income. Excellent health care. Well-funded, accessible universities. Affordable housing. Clean, safe streets achieved by housing the homeless and sheltering and treating the addicted and mentally ill instead of punishing them. Thriving artistic communities in welcoming, multicultural cities. Progressive pricing for the fundamental necessities of life, like energy and shelter.

Any computer can be operated remotely, over any distance, from any other computer. I’m doing that right now by filling out this form. You’re doing it right now by reading what I’ve typed. Where the hardware is plugged in doesn’t matter at all. If we want to foster and retain talented researchers, practitioners and public administrators in Canada, then we need to build communities where young people starting their careers can afford to live, where people growing their careers want to live, and where people in the prime of their careers are happy to live.

## What are the key barriers to AI adoption, and how can government and industry work together to accelerate responsible uptake?

Right now the key barrier to AI adoption is that the people pushing it the hardest are absolutely the least trustworthy people on the planet, with a small army of epistemologically-adrift FOMO-addled C-levels rolling up fast behind them, and it’s being pushed into products and people’s working processes with no regard to utility or productivity at all. Right now, the overarching purpose of large-model AI is not “improved productivity” or “reduced error rates”, it is consuming enough computing resources, through whatever means necessary, that demand for computing stays high enough that the sector can keep their historic high-double-digit growth and returns going, and avoid turning into a commodified utility. But real-world uptake in most of these nonviable scenarios is close to zero and compute as a commodified uitility is where this is going.

Accelerating _responsible_ uptake means a measured approach, using consentfully obtained and carefully curated data to accomplish empirically sound and morally justifiable goals without freeing any person or organization using them from accountability for their actions. This means legal and regulatory frameworks with spine and teeth that understand what safe and consentful mean and impose meaningful costs for failing to meet those standards, and it means investing in historically-undervalued areas like criticism, curation and library sciences as foundational skillsets.

When people depend on their tools – not just use but depend – then the liability avoidance that is absolutely endemic in computing is completely unacceptable. Car companies are simply not permitted to say, if it breaks you can keep both pieces. And it is _the imposition of liability_ that has driven almost all of the modern innovations in automotive quality and safety. AI, and tech in general, needs those constrains in order to thrive.

## What needs to be put in place so Canada can grow globally competitive AI companies while retaining ownership, IP and economic sovereignty?

Again, I am begging you to understand two things: that any computer anywhere in the world can be operated remotely from any other computer anywhere in the world, and that landlords are a dead weight loss to society.

If you want to foster Canadian innovation and champion Canadian companies, any approach to this that involves business incentives and lets the rentier class thrive is – inevitably, mathematically – a race to the bottom.

If you want a new Renaissance, you have to build the new Vienna.

If you want innovative new technologies to exist, you _need_ to create communities where it is safe to fail. You need to create a society where the opportunity to, the ability to, and the tools to experiment are not the sole domain of already comfortable and already privileged. We know what those experiments look like already, they look like Mark Zuckerberg spending eighty billion dollars on the Metaverse and another eighty billion dollars on pretend chatbot friends and it doesn’t matter at all and nobody cares.

If you want to be the place that people go to build the future, you have to bet on people and build a place they’ll believe is worth living in while they try to build that future.

Invest in the arts, invest in the culture, invest in affordable housing and health care and tax the rentier class to fund those investments.

## How can Canada better connect AI research with commercialization to meet strategic business needs?

This is a waste of time and effort.

“Strategic business needs” are near-term problems whose contours and desired outcomes are known, where the remaining questions are about effective execution. Research is a long-term exploration whose results are always uncertain, but that sometimes pay off in wholly unexpected ways, even creating wholly unexpected markets.

When the microwave was invented, not only was there no market for microwaves, but every single kitchen in the world already had a way to heat up water in it. It would have been the easiest thing in the world to say, what’s the point of that, get back to work on stuff that matters.

Focusing on the commercialization of research is the absolute latest part of the process. If you want real innovation, fund speculation. When something interesting comes of it, you’ll get the commercialization for free in a few years.

## What lessons can we learn from countries that are successful at investment attraction in AI and tech, both from domestic sources and from foreign capital?

Nothing.

Right now, we can nothing from countries that are funding their own democratic, economic and ecological destruction by spending billion on circular investments into bubble markets without a real customer in sight, weaponizing automation against their working and minority classes and building vast data warehouses that will demand more electricity and water than their entire regions have available while driving the citizen’s cost of both through the roof.

We can learn nothing from them except how not to approach it and what not to do.

## How can Canada build public trust in AI technologies while addressing the risks they present? What are the most important things to do to build confidence?

Consentfully obtained, accountably auditable training data, transparent (and open source) training techniques, and most importantly: liability.

Most of our debates about freedom and safety are framed in terms of “freedom to”, and the arguments are about the limitations on those freedoms. If you’re luckier than me, those conversations might even involve “freedom from”.

But what if we lived in a society where that wasn’t enough? Where government had a positive obligation to not just permit freedom to, but defend the possibility of? To mandate and enforce standards saying you must be free from the possibility of specific kinds of failure?

We already have that for cars, of course.

The full text of CRC c.1038, the Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations section of the Consolidated Regulations of Canada, runs a full megabyte of text. The Ontario Provincial Standards for Roads &#38; Public Works is eight huge tomes and the first of them, General And Construction Specifications, is 1358 pages long. They detail – in _excruciating_ detail – not just how the roads you’ll be driving on must be built, illuminated, made safe and maintained, but how those standards will be verified, audited and enforced.

Cars and roads built to these standards don’t so much enable freedom of motion and freedom from harm as they delimit in exacting detail on what roads, at what speeds and under what circumstances people must _be free from_ the possibility of specific kinds of harm, where their motion must be free from the possibility of specific kinds of restriction or risk.

The amount of comparable legislation around AI is, I believe, zero.

Canada could building public trust in AI by defining, not just what confidence could mean, but what a positive defence of that confidence and reliability must look like. By defining not just what trustworthiness means, but what specific possibilities of specific harm that trustworthiness means you are free from the possibility of.

That might help.

## What skills are required for a modern, digital economy, and how can Canada best support their development and deployment in the workforce?

Respectfully, your real choices here are to either invest comprehensively in public education at the grade school, secondary and college/university/trades levels, or get some posters printed and pretend they’ll accomplish anything.

I’d rather you invest comprehensively in public education.

(Shoutout to [@grimalkina](https://mastodon.social/@grimalkina &#34;@grimalkina@mastodon.social&#34;) on this one.)

## What can Canada do to ensure equitable access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups?

There’s a famous metric in sociology about the effectiveness of social interventions in education called the “hamburger metric” – that is, if your social intervention can’t be shown, decisively, to be more cost-effective at improving a child’s academic outcomes than feeding them a hamburger, you should skip the intervention and feed them the hamburger.

Canada can ensure equitable access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups by investing equally in access to AI literacy across regions, demographics and socioeconomic groups.

Crazy, I know, but “every student has a clean, warm classroom in a clean warm community with clean warm food, shelter and clean running water” will do it.

## Which infrastructure gaps (compute, data, connectivity) are holding back AI innovation in Canada, and what is stopping Canadian firms from building sovereign infrastructure to address them?

Let’s be real here, you’re not actually going to do anything about this country’s insane telco trigopoly.

## How can we ensure equitable access to AI infrastructure across regions, sectors and users (researchers, start-ups, SMEs)?

Another thing we can be real about is this: Canada already has two pieces of parallel infrastructure in place that provides equitable access to information across regions, sectors and users, available to every facet and lost geographic corner of Canadian society. They’re the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Canada Post.

The hardware is cheap and you can put it anywhere, so put it where we have places that already host hardware. Payment and delivery systems can be anywhere, and we’ve already got them everywhere. If you want equitable access to technology infrastructure and information, so people can start businesses that leverage AI tools from anywhere to anywhere, across Canada then start by leveraging our existing nationwide infrastructure, as a country, to do exactly that:

The CBC should grow to become a citizens’ web hosting service and Canada Post should become a bank.

## How can Canada strengthen cybersecurity and safeguard critical infrastructure, data and models in the age of AI?

Cybersecurity has approximately nothing to do with AI.

If breach insurance companies declared today that your insurance was void if your software wasn’t kept up to date, around 90% of cybersecurity breaches would end tomorrow. If they said your insurance was null and void if you didn’t parameterize your SQL, injection attacks would end tomorrow.

The recent Joint Cybersecurity Advisory from basically every intelligence agency in the Western world that came out last month warning about pervasive Chinese attacks and their success in achieving persistent access, had nothing at all to do with AI. If you go down the list of vulnerabilities being exploited there’s nothing exotic or even interesting in it. Nothing, no zero days, no supply interdiction, no AI, no magic future technology from our ephemeral robot overloads, it’s all “companies did not patch well-known CVEs on time”, and those CVEs are all “programmer did not sanitise their inputs.”

This industry – and this country, and this world - are nowhere near the point where exotic knowledge or tools or magic are required to make huge progress on the cybersecurity front. This industry doesn’t need MRI machines or mRNA vaccines or even penicillin. We need people to wash their hands. Let’s start with that. Maybe if we’re lucky we can even get people to wash their hands with soap. But that’s where we are. People need to wash their damn hands.

      <title>Claude Code for web - a new asynchronous coding agent from Anthropic</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Anthropic launched Claude Code for web this morning. It's an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/async-coding-agents/">asynchronous coding agent</a> - their answer to OpenAI's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/16/openai-codex/">Codex Cloud</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/19/jules/">Google's Jules</a>, and has a very similar shape. I had preview access over the weekend and I've already seen some very promising results from it.</p>
        <p>It's available online at <a href="https://claude.ai">claude.ai/code</a> and shows up as a tab in the Claude iPhone app as well:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-for-web.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Claude AI interface showing a conversation about updating a README file. The left sidebar shows &quot;Claude&quot; at the top, followed by navigation items: &quot;Chats&quot;, &quot;Projects&quot;, &quot;Artifacts&quot;, and &quot;Code&quot; (highlighted). Below that is &quot;Starred&quot; section listing several items with trash icons: &quot;LLM&quot;, &quot;Python app&quot;, &quot;Check my post&quot;, &quot;Artifacts&quot;, &quot;Summarize&quot;, and &quot;Alt text writer&quot;. The center panel shows a conversation list with items like &quot;In progress&quot;, &quot;Run System C&quot;, &quot;Idle&quot;, &quot;Update Rese&quot;, &quot;Run Matplotl&quot;, &quot;Run Marketin&quot;, &quot;WebAssembl&quot;, &quot;Benchmark M&quot;, &quot;Build URL Qu&quot;, and &quot;Add Read-Or&quot;. The right panel displays the active conversation titled &quot;Update Research Project README&quot; showing a task to update a GitHub README file at https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/README.md, followed by Claude's response and command outputs showing file listings with timestamps from Oct 20 17:53." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>As far as I can tell it's their latest <a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code CLI</a> app wrapped in a container (Anthropic are getting <em>really</em> <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/">good at containers</a> these days) and configured to <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code>. It appears to behave exactly the same as the CLI tool, and includes a neat "teleport" feature which can copy both the chat transcript and the edited files down to your local Claude Code CLI tool if you want to take over locally.</p>
        <p>It's very straight-forward to use. You point Claude Code for web at a GitHub repository, select an environment (fully locked down, restricted to an allow-list of domains or configured to access domains of your choosing, including "*" for everything) and kick it off with a prompt.</p>
        <p>While it's running you can send it additional prompts which are queued up and executed after it completes its current step.</p>
        <p>Once it's done it opens a branch on your repo with its work and can optionally open a pull request.</p>
        <h4 id="putting-claude-code-for-web-to-work">Putting Claude Code for web to work</h4>
        <p>Claude Code for web's PRs are indistinguishable from Claude Code CLI's, so Anthropic told me it was OK to submit those against public repos even during the private preview. Here are some examples from this weekend:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/73">Add query-string-stripper.html tool</a> against my simonw/tools repo - a <em>very</em> simple task that creates (and deployed via GitHub Pages) this <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/query-string-stripper">query-string-stripper</a> tool.</li>
        <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/minijinja-vs-jinja2">minijinja vs jinja2 Performance Benchmark</a> - I ran this against a private repo and then copied the results here, so no PR. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/minijinja-vs-jinja2/README.md#the-prompt">the prompt</a> I used.</li>
        <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/1">Update deepseek-ocr README to reflect successful project completion</a> - I noticed that the README produced by Claude Code CLI for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/">this project</a> was misleadingly out of date, so I had Claude Code for web fix the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That second example is the most interesting. I saw <a href="https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1980034078297514319">a tweet from Armin</a> about his <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja">MiniJinja</a> Rust template language <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/pull/841">adding support</a> for Python 3.14 free threading. I hadn't realized that project <em>had</em> Python bindings, so I decided it would be interesting to see a quick performance comparison between MiniJinja and Jinja2.</p>
        <p>I ran Claude Code for web against a private repository with a completely open environment (<code>*</code> in the allow-list) and prompted:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I’m interested in benchmarking the Python bindings for <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja">https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja</a> against the equivalente template using Python jinja2</p>
        <p>Design and implement a benchmark for this. It should use the latest main checkout of minijinja and the latest stable release of jinja2. The benchmark should use the uv version of Python 3.14 and should test both the regular 3.14 and the 3.14t free threaded version - so four scenarios total</p>
        <p>The benchmark should run against a reasonably complicated example of a template, using template inheritance and loops and such like In the PR include a shell script to run the entire benchmark, plus benchmark implantation, plus markdown file describing the benchmark and the results in detail, plus some illustrative charts created using matplotlib</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I entered this into the Claude iPhone app on my mobile keyboard, hence the typos.</p>
        <p>It churned away for a few minutes and gave me exactly what I asked for. Here's one of the <a href="">four charts</a> it created:</p>
        <p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/minijinja-timeline.jpg" alt="Line chart titled &quot;Rendering Time Across Iterations&quot; showing rendering time in milliseconds (y-axis, ranging from approximately 1.0 to 2.5 ms) versus iteration number (x-axis, ranging from 0 to 200+). Four different lines represent different versions: minijinja (3.14t) shown as a solid blue line, jinja2 (3.14) as a solid orange line, minijinja (3.14) as a solid green line, and jinja2 (3.14t) as a dashed red line. The green line (minijinja 3.14) shows consistently higher rendering times with several prominent spikes reaching 2.5ms around iterations 25, 75, and 150. The other three lines show more stable, lower rendering times between 1.0-1.5ms with occasional fluctuations." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
        <p>(I was surprised to see MiniJinja out-performed by Jinja2, but I guess Jinja2 has had a decade of clever performance optimizations and doesn't need to deal with any extra overhead of calling out to Rust.)</p>
        <p>Note that I would likely have got the <em>exact same</em> result running this prompt against Claude CLI on my laptop. The benefit of Claude Code for web is entirely in its convenience as a way of running these tasks in a hosted container managed by Anthropic, with a pleasant web and mobile UI layered over the top.</p>
        <h4 id="anthropic-are-framing-this-as-part-of-their-sandboxing-strategy">Anthropic are framing this as part of their sandboxing strategy</h4>
        <p>It's interesting how Anthropic chose to announce this new feature: the product launch is buried half way down their new engineering blog post <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-sandboxing">Beyond permission prompts: making Claude Code more secure and autonomous</a>, which starts like this:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Claude Code's new sandboxing features, a bash tool and Claude Code on the web, reduce permission prompts and increase user safety by enabling two boundaries: filesystem and network isolation.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I'm <em>very</em> excited to hear that Claude Code CLI is taking sandboxing more seriously. I've not yet dug into the details of that - it looks like it's using seatbelt on macOS and <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap">Bubblewrap</a> on Linux.</p>
        
        <p>Anthropic released a new open source (Apache 2) library, <a href="https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime">anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime</a>, with their implementation of this so far.</p>
        
        <p>Filesystem sandboxing is relatively easy. The harder problem is network isolation, which they describe like this:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Network isolation</strong>, by only allowing internet access through a unix domain socket connected to a proxy server running outside the sandbox. This proxy server enforces restrictions on the domains that a process can connect to, and handles user confirmation for newly requested domains. And if you’d like further-increased security, we also support customizing this proxy to enforce arbitrary rules on outgoing traffic.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is <em>crucial</em> to protecting against both prompt injection and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">lethal trifecta</a> attacks. The best way to prevent lethal trifecta attacks is to cut off one of the three legs, and network isolation is how you remove the data exfiltration leg that allows successful attackers to steal your data.</p>
        <p>If you run Claude Code for web in "No network access" mode you have nothing to worry about.</p>
        <p>I'm a little bit nervous about their "Trusted network access" environment. It's intended to only allow access to domains relating to dependency installation, but the <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude-code-on-the-web#default-allowed-domains">default domain list</a> has dozens of entries which makes me nervous about unintended exfiltration vectors sneaking through.</p>
        <p>You can also configure a custom environment with your own allow-list. I have one called "Everything" which allow-lists "*", because for projects like my MiniJinja/Jinja2 comparison above there are no secrets or source code involved that need protecting.</p>
        <p>I see Anthropic's focus on sandboxes as an acknowledgment that coding agents run in YOLO mode (<code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> and the like) are <em>enormously</em> more valuable and productive than agents where you have to approve their every step.</p>
        <p>The challenge is making it convenient and easy to run them safely. This kind of sandboxing kind is the only approach to safety that feels credible to me.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: A note on cost: I'm currently using a Claude "Max" plan that Anthropic gave me in order to test some of their features, so I don't have a good feeling for how Claude Code would cost for these kinds of projects.</p>
        
        <p>From running <code>npx ccusage@latest</code> (an <a href="https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage">unofficial cost estimate tool</a>) it looks like I'm using between $1 and $5 worth of daily Claude CLI invocations at the moment.</p>

      <source:markdown>Anthropic launched Claude Code for web this morning. It&#39;s an [asynchronous coding agent](https://simonwillison.net/tags/async-coding-agents/) \- their answer to OpenAI&#39;s [Codex Cloud](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/16/openai-codex/) and [Google&#39;s Jules](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/19/jules/), and has a very similar shape. I had preview access over the weekend and I&#39;ve already seen some very promising results from it.

It&#39;s available online at [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai) and shows up as a tab in the Claude iPhone app as well:

![Screenshot of Claude AI interface showing a conversation about updating a README file. The left sidebar shows &#34;Claude&#34; at the top, followed by navigation items: &#34;Chats&#34;, &#34;Projects&#34;, &#34;Artifacts&#34;, and &#34;Code&#34; (highlighted). Below that is &#34;Starred&#34; section listing several items with trash icons: &#34;LLM&#34;, &#34;Python app&#34;, &#34;Check my post&#34;, &#34;Artifacts&#34;, &#34;Summarize&#34;, and &#34;Alt text writer&#34;. The center panel shows a conversation list with items like &#34;In progress&#34;, &#34;Run System C&#34;, &#34;Idle&#34;, &#34;Update Rese&#34;, &#34;Run Matplotl&#34;, &#34;Run Marketin&#34;, &#34;WebAssembl&#34;, &#34;Benchmark M&#34;, &#34;Build URL Qu&#34;, and &#34;Add Read-Or&#34;. The right panel displays the active conversation titled &#34;Update Research Project README&#34; showing a task to update a GitHub README file at https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/README.md, followed by Claude&#39;s response and command outputs showing file listings with timestamps from Oct 20 17:53.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-for-web.jpg)

As far as I can tell it&#39;s their latest [Claude Code CLI](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) app wrapped in a container (Anthropic are getting _really_ [good at containers](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/) these days) and configured to `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. It appears to behave exactly the same as the CLI tool, and includes a neat &#34;teleport&#34; feature which can copy both the chat transcript and the edited files down to your local Claude Code CLI tool if you want to take over locally.

It&#39;s very straight-forward to use. You point Claude Code for web at a GitHub repository, select an environment (fully locked down, restricted to an allow-list of domains or configured to access domains of your choosing, including &#34;\*&#34; for everything) and kick it off with a prompt.

While it&#39;s running you can send it additional prompts which are queued up and executed after it completes its current step.

Once it&#39;s done it opens a branch on your repo with its work and can optionally open a pull request.

#### Putting Claude Code for web to work

Claude Code for web&#39;s PRs are indistinguishable from Claude Code CLI&#39;s, so Anthropic told me it was OK to submit those against public repos even during the private preview. Here are some examples from this weekend:

- [Add query-string-stripper.html tool](https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/73) against my simonw/tools repo - a _very_ simple task that creates (and deployed via GitHub Pages) this [query-string-stripper](https://tools.simonwillison.net/query-string-stripper) tool.
- [minijinja vs jinja2 Performance Benchmark](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/minijinja-vs-jinja2) \- I ran this against a private repo and then copied the results here, so no PR. Here&#39;s [the prompt](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/minijinja-vs-jinja2/README.md#the-prompt) I used.
- [Update deepseek-ocr README to reflect successful project completion](https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/1) \- I noticed that the README produced by Claude Code CLI for [this project](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/) was misleadingly out of date, so I had Claude Code for web fix the problem.

That second example is the most interesting. I saw [a tweet from Armin](https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1980034078297514319) about his [MiniJinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja) Rust template language [adding support](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/pull/841) for Python 3.14 free threading. I hadn&#39;t realized that project _had_ Python bindings, so I decided it would be interesting to see a quick performance comparison between MiniJinja and Jinja2.

I ran Claude Code for web against a private repository with a completely open environment ( `*` in the allow-list) and prompted:

&#62; I’m interested in benchmarking the Python bindings for [https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja) against the equivalente template using Python jinja2
&#62;
&#62; Design and implement a benchmark for this. It should use the latest main checkout of minijinja and the latest stable release of jinja2. The benchmark should use the uv version of Python 3.14 and should test both the regular 3.14 and the 3.14t free threaded version - so four scenarios total
&#62;
&#62; The benchmark should run against a reasonably complicated example of a template, using template inheritance and loops and such like In the PR include a shell script to run the entire benchmark, plus benchmark implantation, plus markdown file describing the benchmark and the results in detail, plus some illustrative charts created using matplotlib

I entered this into the Claude iPhone app on my mobile keyboard, hence the typos.

It churned away for a few minutes and gave me exactly what I asked for. Here&#39;s one of the four charts it created:

![Line chart titled &#34;Rendering Time Across Iterations&#34; showing rendering time in milliseconds (y-axis, ranging from approximately 1.0 to 2.5 ms) versus iteration number (x-axis, ranging from 0 to 200+). Four different lines represent different versions: minijinja (3.14t) shown as a solid blue line, jinja2 (3.14) as a solid orange line, minijinja (3.14) as a solid green line, and jinja2 (3.14t) as a dashed red line. The green line (minijinja 3.14) shows consistently higher rendering times with several prominent spikes reaching 2.5ms around iterations 25, 75, and 150. The other three lines show more stable, lower rendering times between 1.0-1.5ms with occasional fluctuations.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/minijinja-timeline.jpg)

(I was surprised to see MiniJinja out-performed by Jinja2, but I guess Jinja2 has had a decade of clever performance optimizations and doesn&#39;t need to deal with any extra overhead of calling out to Rust.)

Note that I would likely have got the _exact same_ result running this prompt against Claude CLI on my laptop. The benefit of Claude Code for web is entirely in its convenience as a way of running these tasks in a hosted container managed by Anthropic, with a pleasant web and mobile UI layered over the top.

#### Anthropic are framing this as part of their sandboxing strategy

It&#39;s interesting how Anthropic chose to announce this new feature: the product launch is buried half way down their new engineering blog post [Beyond permission prompts: making Claude Code more secure and autonomous](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-sandboxing), which starts like this:

&#62; Claude Code&#39;s new sandboxing features, a bash tool and Claude Code on the web, reduce permission prompts and increase user safety by enabling two boundaries: filesystem and network isolation.

I&#39;m _very_ excited to hear that Claude Code CLI is taking sandboxing more seriously. I&#39;ve not yet dug into the details of that - it looks like it&#39;s using seatbelt on macOS and [Bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) on Linux.

Anthropic released a new open source (Apache 2) library, [anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime), with their implementation of this so far.

Filesystem sandboxing is relatively easy. The harder problem is network isolation, which they describe like this:

&#62; **Network isolation**, by only allowing internet access through a unix domain socket connected to a proxy server running outside the sandbox. This proxy server enforces restrictions on the domains that a process can connect to, and handles user confirmation for newly requested domains. And if you’d like further-increased security, we also support customizing this proxy to enforce arbitrary rules on outgoing traffic.

This is _crucial_ to protecting against both prompt injection and [lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) attacks. The best way to prevent lethal trifecta attacks is to cut off one of the three legs, and network isolation is how you remove the data exfiltration leg that allows successful attackers to steal your data.

If you run Claude Code for web in &#34;No network access&#34; mode you have nothing to worry about.

I&#39;m a little bit nervous about their &#34;Trusted network access&#34; environment. It&#39;s intended to only allow access to domains relating to dependency installation, but the [default domain list](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude-code-on-the-web#default-allowed-domains) has dozens of entries which makes me nervous about unintended exfiltration vectors sneaking through.

You can also configure a custom environment with your own allow-list. I have one called &#34;Everything&#34; which allow-lists &#34;\*&#34;, because for projects like my MiniJinja/Jinja2 comparison above there are no secrets or source code involved that need protecting.

I see Anthropic&#39;s focus on sandboxes as an acknowledgment that coding agents run in YOLO mode ( `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and the like) are _enormously_ more valuable and productive than agents where you have to approve their every step.

The challenge is making it convenient and easy to run them safely. This kind of sandboxing kind is the only approach to safety that feels credible to me.

**Update**: A note on cost: I&#39;m currently using a Claude &#34;Max&#34; plan that Anthropic gave me in order to test some of their features, so I don&#39;t have a good feeling for how Claude Code would cost for these kinds of projects.

From running `npx ccusage@latest` (an [unofficial cost estimate tool](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage)) it looks like I&#39;m using between $1 and $5 worth of daily Claude CLI invocations at the moment.

      <title>Getting DeepSeek-OCR working on an NVIDIA Spark via brute force using Claude Code</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>DeepSeek released a new model yesterday: <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">DeepSeek-OCR</a>, a 6.6GB model fine-tuned specifically for OCR. They released it as model weights that run using PyTorch and CUDA. I got it running on the NVIDIA Spark by having Claude Code effectively brute force the challenge of getting it working on that particular hardware.</p>
        <p>This small project (40 minutes this morning, most of which was Claude Code churning away while I had breakfast and did some other things) ties together a bunch of different concepts I've been exploring recently. I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designed an agentic loop</a> for the problem, gave Claude full permissions inside a Docker sandbox, embraced the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/">parallel agents lifestyle</a> and reused my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/nvidia-dgx-spark/">notes on the NVIDIA Spark</a> from last week.</p>
        <p>I knew getting a PyTorch CUDA model running on the Spark was going to be a little frustrating, so I decided to outsource the entire process to Claude Code to see what would happen.</p>
        <p>TLDR: It worked. It took four prompts (one long, three very short) to have Claude Code figure out everything necessary to run the new DeepSeek model on the NVIDIA Spark, OCR a document for me and produce <em>copious</em> notes about the process.</p>
        <h4 id="the-setup">The setup</h4>
        <p>I connected to the Spark from my Mac via SSH and started a new Docker container there:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>docker run -it --gpus=all \
          -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro \
          nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04 \
          bash</pre></div>
        <p>Then I installed npm and used that to install Claude Code:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>apt-get update
        DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive TZ=Etc/UTC apt-get install -y npm
        npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code</pre></div>
        <p>Then started Claude Code, telling it that it's OK that it's running as <code>root</code> because it's in a sandbox:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>IS_SANDBOX=1 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</pre></div>
        <p>It provided me a URL to click on to authenticate with my Anthropic account.</p>
        <h4 id="the-initial-prompts">The initial prompts</h4>
        <p>I kicked things off with this prompt:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Create a folder deepseek-ocr and do everything else in that folder</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then I ran the following, providing links to both the GitHub repository and the Hugging Face model, providing a clue about NVIDIA ARM and giving it an image (<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg">this one</a>, see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/the-perils-of-vibe-coding/">previous post</a>) that I wanted it to run OCR on.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Your task is to get this working: <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR</a> - it uses Hugging Face Transformers and models from <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR</a> - you are running in a Docker container on an NVIDIA ARM device, first research your environment to check it will be possible to do this. Git clone both of those - you may need to enable LFS first. Make extensive notes as you go in a notes.md file which you should only ever append new notes to. At the end of this you should have scripts in the folder which can be run to both setup and then run the model against an example - use <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg">https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg</a> as the example image that you OCR. As a final step create a detailed README.md file explaining the project and what you learned and how to run your code.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Note how I also told it to "make extensive notes as you go in a notes.md file which you should only ever append new notes to" so I'd have some useful notes at the end.</p>
        <h4 id="the-follow-ups">The follow-ups</h4>
        <p>It churned away for 13 minutes, and made a sequence of discoveries about the platform and the model and the difficulties of running PyTorch on it.</p>
        <p>And then... <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-assistant--2025-10-20-154706">it gave up</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>The NVIDIA GB10 GPU has compute capability sm_121, which is too new for PyTorch 2.5.1</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>PyTorch 2.5.1 supports: sm_50, sm_80, sm_86, sm_89, sm_90, sm_90a</li>
        <li>GB10 requires: sm_121</li>
        <li>Error: <code>CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device</code>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, the model has hardcoded <code>.cuda()</code> calls, preventing CPU fallback without code modifications.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>So I gave it some encouragement:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Any other options that might help get CUDA working like using different versions of PyTorch that have available CUDA wheels for this platform? Have you checked to see what PyTorch versions already have these ARM CUDA wheels that would work here?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It ran this command to grep for all available PyTorch wheels on <code>download.pytorch.org</code> that match the ARM architecture:</p>
        <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>curl -s https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch/ <span class="pl-k">|</span> grep -o <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>torch-[0-9.]*.*aarch64.whl<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> sort -V <span class="pl-k">|</span> tail -20</pre></div>
        <p>... and that unblocked it.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Excellent! I can see that PyTorch 2.9.0 has ARM64 wheels for CUDA 12.8, 12.9, and <strong>CUDA 13.0</strong> (cu130)! This is exactly what we need!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It installed the wheels it found and reported:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Good news! PyTorch 2.9.0 can detect the GB10 GPU with CUDA capability 12.1 (sm_121), but it says the maximum supported is 12.0. However, it's just a warning now instead of a hard error! Let's try running inference: [...]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then kept on churning for a bit, ignoring warnings, and managed to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-user--2025-10-20-155056">run the model</a>! It loaded the image and ran this prompt:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;|grounding|&gt;OCR this image.
        </code></pre>
        <p>And got back output that started like this:</p>

        <h4 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h4>
        <p>My first prompt was at 15:31:07 (UTC). The final message from Claude Code came in at 16:10:03. That means it took less than 40 minutes start to finish, and I was only actively involved for about 5-10 minutes of that time. The rest of the time I was having breakfast and doing other things.</p>
        <p>Having tried and failed to get PyTorch stuff working in the past, I count this as a <em>huge</em> win. I'll be using this process a whole lot more in the future.</p>
        <p>How good were the actual results? There's honestly so much material in the resulting notes created by Claude that I haven't reviewed all of it. There may well be all sorts of errors in there, but it's indisputable that it managed to run the model and made notes on how it did that such that I'll be able to do the same thing in the future.</p>
        <p>I think the key factors in executing this project successfully were the following:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>I gave it exactly what it needed: a Docker environment in the target hardware, instructions on where to get what it needed (the code and the model) and a clear goal for it to pursue. This is a great example of the pattern I described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing agentic loops</a>.</li>
        <li>Running it in a Docker sandbox meant I could use <code>claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</code> and leave it running on its own. If I'd had to approve every command it wanted to run I would have got frustrated and quit the project after just a few minutes.</li>
        <li>I applied my own knowledge and experience when it got stuck. I was confident (based on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/nvidia-dgx-spark/#claude-code-for-everything">previous experiments</a> with the Spark) that a CUDA wheel for ARM64 existed that was likely to work, so when it gave up I prompted it to try again, leading to success.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Oh, and it looks like DeepSeek OCR is a pretty good model if you spend the time experimenting with different ways to run it.</p>
        <h4 id="bonus-using-vs-code-to-monitor-the-container">Bonus: Using VS Code to monitor the container</h4>
        <p>A small TIL from today: I had kicked off the job running in the Docker container via SSH to the Spark when I realized it would be neat if I could easily monitor the files it was creating while it was running.</p>
        <p>I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/68a0ebff-b586-4278-bd91-6b715a657d2b">asked Claude.ai</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I am running a Docker container on a remote machine, which I started over SSH</p>
        <p>How can I have my local VS Code on MacOS show me the filesystem in that docker container inside that remote machine, without restarting anything?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It gave me a set of steps that solved this exact problem:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Install the VS Code "Remote SSH" and "Dev Containers" extensions</li>
        <li>Use "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host" to connect to the remote machine (on my Tailscale network that's <code>spark@100.113.1.114</code>)</li>
        <li>In the window for that remote SSH session, run "Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container" - this shows a list of containers and you can select the one you want to attach to</li>
        <li>... and that's it! VS Code opens a new window providing full access to all of the files in that container. I opened up <code>notes.md</code> and watched it as Claude Code appended to it in real time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>At the end when I told Claude to create a zip file of the results I could select that in the VS Code file explorer and use the "Download" menu item to download it to my Mac.</p>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>DeepSeek released a new model yesterday: [DeepSeek-OCR](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR), a 6.6GB model fine-tuned specifically for OCR. They released it as model weights that run using PyTorch and CUDA. I got it running on the NVIDIA Spark by having Claude Code effectively brute force the challenge of getting it working on that particular hardware.

This small project (40 minutes this morning, most of which was Claude Code churning away while I had breakfast and did some other things) ties together a bunch of different concepts I&#39;ve been exploring recently. I [designed an agentic loop](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/) for the problem, gave Claude full permissions inside a Docker sandbox, embraced the [parallel agents lifestyle](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/) and reused my [notes on the NVIDIA Spark](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/nvidia-dgx-spark/) from last week.

I knew getting a PyTorch CUDA model running on the Spark was going to be a little frustrating, so I decided to outsource the entire process to Claude Code to see what would happen.

TLDR: It worked. It took four prompts (one long, three very short) to have Claude Code figure out everything necessary to run the new DeepSeek model on the NVIDIA Spark, OCR a document for me and produce _copious_ notes about the process.

#### The setup

I connected to the Spark from my Mac via SSH and started a new Docker container there:

```
docker run -it --gpus=all \
  -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04 \
  bash
```

Then I installed npm and used that to install Claude Code:

```
apt-get update
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive TZ=Etc/UTC apt-get install -y npm
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then started Claude Code, telling it that it&#39;s OK that it&#39;s running as `root` because it&#39;s in a sandbox:

```
IS_SANDBOX=1 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

It provided me a URL to click on to authenticate with my Anthropic account.

#### The initial prompts

I kicked things off with this prompt:

&#62; Create a folder deepseek-ocr and do everything else in that folder

Then I ran the following, providing links to both the GitHub repository and the Hugging Face model, providing a clue about NVIDIA ARM and giving it an image ( [this one](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg), see [previous post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/the-perils-of-vibe-coding/)) that I wanted it to run OCR on.

&#62; Your task is to get this working: [https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR) \- it uses Hugging Face Transformers and models from [https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR) \- you are running in a Docker container on an NVIDIA ARM device, first research your environment to check it will be possible to do this. Git clone both of those - you may need to enable LFS first. Make extensive notes as you go in a notes.md file which you should only ever append new notes to. At the end of this you should have scripts in the folder which can be run to both setup and then run the model against an example - use [https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg) as the example image that you OCR. As a final step create a detailed README.md file explaining the project and what you learned and how to run your code.

Note how I also told it to &#34;make extensive notes as you go in a notes.md file which you should only ever append new notes to&#34; so I&#39;d have some useful notes at the end.

#### The follow-ups

It churned away for 13 minutes, and made a sequence of discoveries about the platform and the model and the difficulties of running PyTorch on it.

And then... [it gave up](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-assistant--2025-10-20-154706):

&#62; **The NVIDIA GB10 GPU has compute capability sm\_121, which is too new for PyTorch 2.5.1**
&#62;
&#62; - PyTorch 2.5.1 supports: sm\_50, sm\_80, sm\_86, sm\_89, sm\_90, sm\_90a
&#62; - GB10 requires: sm\_121
&#62; - Error: `CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device`
&#62;
&#62; Additionally, the model has hardcoded `.cuda()` calls, preventing CPU fallback without code modifications.

So I gave it some encouragement:

&#62; Any other options that might help get CUDA working like using different versions of PyTorch that have available CUDA wheels for this platform? Have you checked to see what PyTorch versions already have these ARM CUDA wheels that would work here?

It ran this command to grep for all available PyTorch wheels on `download.pytorch.org` that match the ARM architecture:

```
curl -s https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch/ | grep -o &#39;torch-[0-9.]*.*aarch64.whl&#39; | sort -V | tail -20
```

... and that unblocked it.

&#62; Excellent! I can see that PyTorch 2.9.0 has ARM64 wheels for CUDA 12.8, 12.9, and **CUDA 13.0** (cu130)! This is exactly what we need!

It installed the wheels it found and reported:

&#62; Good news! PyTorch 2.9.0 can detect the GB10 GPU with CUDA capability 12.1 (sm\_121), but it says the maximum supported is 12.0. However, it&#39;s just a warning now instead of a hard error! Let&#39;s try running inference: \[...\]

Then kept on churning for a bit, ignoring warnings, and managed to [run the model](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-user--2025-10-20-155056)! It loaded the image and ran this prompt:

```
&#60;|grounding|&#62;OCR this image.

```

And got back output that started like this:

```

```

Claude declared victory and pointed me to the [output/result.mmd](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/output/result.mmd?short_path=f43da6a) file, which contained only whitespace. So OCR had worked but the result had failed to be written correctly to disk.

I [said](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-user--2025-10-20-155826):

&#62; That result.mmd file looks to be exclusively whitespace to me, try and get a better result there - the bounding box image was good though

Which caused Claude to [reconsider](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/claude-log.md#-assistant--2025-10-20-155900) the prompt it used:

&#62; Maybe we need to use a different prompt. Looking at the README from DeepSeek-OCR, there are different prompts:
&#62;
&#62; - `&#34;&#60;image&#62;\n&#60;|grounding|&#62;Convert the document to markdown.&#34;` \- for documents
&#62; - `&#34;&#60;image&#62;\n&#60;|grounding|&#62;OCR this image.&#34;` \- general OCR
&#62; - `&#34;&#60;image&#62;\nFree OCR.&#34;` \- without layouts
&#62;
&#62; The &#34;grounding&#34; mode seems to be focused on bounding boxes, which is why we got good bounding box results but the text output might be in a different format.
&#62;
&#62; Let me try running it again with a different prompt that&#39;s more focused on text extraction rather than grounding.

It tried all of the prompt variants, [made a note about them](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/notes.md#text-output-improvement-2025-10-20-1601) and created a file called [PROMPTS\_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/PROMPTS_GUIDE.md) with a bunch more details, including this comparison table:

And this table under the heading &#34;Performance Benchmarks&#34;:

My final prompt was this, to gather everything together into a zip file I could extract from the Docker container:

&#62; Create a zip file with the output and output\_text and all of the scripts and notes - but leave out the github repo and the huggingface repo directories

I added the contents of that zip file to my new [simonw/research](https://github.com/simonw/research) GitHub repo [in the deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark](https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark) folder.

Claude really likes writing notes! Here&#39;s the directory listing of that finished folder:

#### Takeaways

My first prompt was at 15:31:07 (UTC). The final message from Claude Code came in at 16:10:03. That means it took less than 40 minutes start to finish, and I was only actively involved for about 5-10 minutes of that time. The rest of the time I was having breakfast and doing other things.

Having tried and failed to get PyTorch stuff working in the past, I count this as a _huge_ win. I&#39;ll be using this process a whole lot more in the future.

How good were the actual results? There&#39;s honestly so much material in the resulting notes created by Claude that I haven&#39;t reviewed all of it. There may well be all sorts of errors in there, but it&#39;s indisputable that it managed to run the model and made notes on how it did that such that I&#39;ll be able to do the same thing in the future.

I think the key factors in executing this project successfully were the following:

1. I gave it exactly what it needed: a Docker environment in the target hardware, instructions on where to get what it needed (the code and the model) and a clear goal for it to pursue. This is a great example of the pattern I described in [designing agentic loops](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/).
2. Running it in a Docker sandbox meant I could use `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` and leave it running on its own. If I&#39;d had to approve every command it wanted to run I would have got frustrated and quit the project after just a few minutes.
3. I applied my own knowledge and experience when it got stuck. I was confident (based on [previous experiments](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/nvidia-dgx-spark/#claude-code-for-everything) with the Spark) that a CUDA wheel for ARM64 existed that was likely to work, so when it gave up I prompted it to try again, leading to success.

Oh, and it looks like DeepSeek OCR is a pretty good model if you spend the time experimenting with different ways to run it.

#### Bonus: Using VS Code to monitor the container

A small TIL from today: I had kicked off the job running in the Docker container via SSH to the Spark when I realized it would be neat if I could easily monitor the files it was creating while it was running.

I [asked Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/share/68a0ebff-b586-4278-bd91-6b715a657d2b):

&#62; I am running a Docker container on a remote machine, which I started over SSH
&#62;
&#62; How can I have my local VS Code on MacOS show me the filesystem in that docker container inside that remote machine, without restarting anything?

It gave me a set of steps that solved this exact problem:

1. Install the VS Code &#34;Remote SSH&#34; and &#34;Dev Containers&#34; extensions
2. Use &#34;Remote-SSH: Connect to Host&#34; to connect to the remote machine (on my Tailscale network that&#39;s `spark@100.113.1.114`)
3. In the window for that remote SSH session, run &#34;Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container&#34; - this shows a list of containers and you can select the one you want to attach to
4. ... and that&#39;s it! VS Code opens a new window providing full access to all of the files in that container. I opened up `notes.md` and watched it as Claude Code appended to it in real time.

At the end when I told Claude to create a zip file of the results I could select that in the VS Code file explorer and use the &#34;Download&#34; menu item to download it to my Mac.

      <title>GSoC 2025: Usability Improvements for the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer</title>
      <link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-09-01-gsoc-ubsan-trap-messages/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>My name is Anthony and I had the pleasure of working on improving the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer this Google Summer of Code 2025. My mentors were Dan Liew and Michael Buch.</p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan) is a tool for detecting a subset of the undefined behaviors in the C, C++, and Objective-C languages at runtime. This project focused mainly on the trapping variant of UBSan, which is evoked through <code>-fsanitize-trap=&lt;...&gt;</code> along with <code>-fsanitize=&lt;...&gt;</code>. Trapping UBSan is a lighter-weight version of UBSan because upon detection of undefined behavior a trap instruction is executed rather than calling into a runtime library to handle the undefined behavior. This makes it more appealing for kernel, embedded, and production hardening use cases. For cases of undefined behavior that can be detected by UBSan, check out the <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">official clang documentation</a>.</p><p>An issue with trapping UBSan prior to my work was that it was much harder to debug undefined behavior when it is detected when compared to the non-trapping mode. To illustrate this consider this C program that reads integers from the command line arguments and adds them.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;int add(int a, int b) { return a + b;}int main(int argc, const char** argv) { if (argc &lt; 3) return 1; int a = atoi(argv[1]); int b = atoi(argv[2]); int result = add(a, b); printf(&#34;Added %d + %d = %d\n&#34;, a, b, result); return 0;}</code></pre><p>If this program is compiled and executed using UBSan with its userspace runtime it provides helpful output diagnosing the problem and also allows execution to continue.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ bin/clang -fsanitize=undefined add.c -g -o add &amp;&amp; ./add 2147483647 1add.c:5:13: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 2147483647 + 1 cannot be represented in type &#39;int&#39;SUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior add.c:5:13 Added 2147483647 + 1 = -2147483648</code></pre><p>In contrast when using UBSan in trapping mode the program immediately terminates when undefined behavior is detected as shown below.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o add &amp;&amp; ./add 2147483647 1[1] 54357 trace trap ./add 2147483647 1</code></pre><p>This is the expected behavior of trapping mode but how should a developer debug what happened when a trap is hit? If we attach a debugger and run the example program this is the output LLDB shows.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ lldb ./add -- 2147483647 1 (lldb) target create &#34;./add&#34;(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args &#34;2147483647&#34; &#34;1&#34;(lldb) rProcess 17347 launched: &#39;add&#39; (arm64)Process 17347 stopped* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = EXC_BREAKPOINT (code=1, subcode=0x100003d3c) frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 2 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 3 4 int add(int a, int b) {-&gt; 5 return a + b; 6 } 7 8 int main(int argc, const char** argv) {(lldb) bt* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = EXC_BREAKPOINT (code=1, subcode=0x100003d3c) * frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 frame #1: 0x0000000100003eec add`main(argc=3, argv=0x000000016fdff110) at add.c:13:18 frame #2: 0x00000001842bab98 dyld`start + 6076(lldb) dis -padd`add:-&gt; 0x100003d3c &lt;+40&gt;: brk #0x5500 0x100003d40 &lt;+44&gt;: ldr w0, [sp, #0x4] 0x100003d44 &lt;+48&gt;: add sp, sp, #0x10 0x100003d48 &lt;+52&gt;: ret </code></pre><p>We can see that a <code>brk</code> instruction was hit while handling the <code>a + b</code> expression but there is no good explanation of what happened. <code>brk</code> is the trap instruction on arm64 but it is not particularly clear this has anything to do with UBSan. For this toy example we can speculate that integer overflow occurred because the program was built with trapping UBSan and the trap was hit while handling <code>a + b</code>. However, in real programs built with trapping UBSan and potentially other hardening mechanisms it is often far less obvious what happened.</p><p>For this particular example. The information that this is an integer overflow UBSan check is actually there but it is not very obvious. On x86_64 and arm64 the reason for trapping is actually <a href="https://maskray.me/blog/2023-01-29-all-about-undefined-behavior-sanitizer">encoded in the operand to the trap instruction</a>. In this case the <code>#0x5500</code> immediate to the brk instruction encodes that this is a UBSan trap for integer overflow. The UBSan immediate is encoded as <code>('U' &lt;&lt; 8) + SanitizerHandler</code> where <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/96195e7d44613e272475c90df187678036f21966/clang/lib/CodeGen/SanitizerHandler.h#L78"><code>SanitizerHandler</code> is the enum value from the <code>SanitizerHandler</code> enum inside Clang’s internals</a>.</p><p>As we can see the debugging experience with UBSan traps is not ideal and improving this was the primary goal of the GSoC project.</p><h2 id="human-readable-descriptions-of-ubsan-traps-in-lldb">Human readable descriptions of UBSan traps in LLDB</h2><p>The natural place to tackle the debugging experience was to look at debugger integration.</p><h3 id="let-the-debugger-handle-most-of-the-work">Let the debugger handle most of the work</h3><p>One approach to this would be to teach debuggers (e.g. LLDB) to decode the trap reason encoded in trap instructions in the debugger. However, this approach wasn’t taken for several reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Using the trap reason encoded in trap instructions only works for x86_64 and arm64. The approach that I used works for all targets where debug info is supported (many more).</p></li><li><p>Relying on decoding the trap reason encoded in the trap instruction creates a tight coupling between the compiler and the debugger because if the encoding ever changes:</p><ul><li><p>The debugger would need to be changed to adapt to the new encoding.</p></li><li><p>Older versions of the debugger would fail to work with binaries using the new encoding.</p></li><li><p>New versions of the debugger would fail to work with binaries using the old encoding.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>In contrast, encoding the trap reason as a string in the debug info is a much looser coupling because the compiler is free to change the trap reason without changes to the debugger.</p></li></ul><h3 id="encoding-the-trap-reason-in-the-debug-info">Encoding the trap reason in the debug info</h3><p>The approach I took is based on how <code>__builtin_verbose_trap</code> encodes its message into debug info [11] [12], a feature which was implemented in the past for <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-hardening-in-libc/73925">libc++ hardening</a>. The core idea is that the trap reason string gets encoded directly in the trap&rsquo;s debug information.</p><p>To accomplish this, we needed to find a place to &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; the string in the DWARF DIE tree. Using a <code>DW_TAG_subprogram</code> was deemed the most straightforward and space-efficient location. This means we create a synthetic <code>DISubprogram</code> which is not a real function in the compiled program; it exists only in the debug info as a container. While the string could have been placed elsewhere, for reasons outside the scope of this blog post, it resides on this fake function DIE, with the trap reason encoded in the <code>DW_TAG_subprogram</code>&rsquo;s name. For a deeper dive into this design decision, you can see <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967#issuecomment-3054319138">[15]</a>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at the LLVM IR of the previous example to see how this is implemented:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o - -o - -S -emit-llvm -fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons=basic; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind optnone ssp uwtable(sync)define i32 @add(i32 noundef %a, i32 noundef %b) #0 !dbg !17 !func_sanitize !22 {entry: %a.addr = alloca i32, align 4 %b.addr = alloca i32, align 4 store i32 %a, ptr %a.addr, align 4 #dbg_declare(ptr %a.addr, !23, !DIExpression(), !24) store i32 %b, ptr %b.addr, align 4 #dbg_declare(ptr %b.addr, !25, !DIExpression(), !26) %0 = load i32, ptr %a.addr, align 4, !dbg !27 %1 = load i32, ptr %b.addr, align 4, !dbg !28 %2 = call { i32, i1 } @llvm.sadd.with.overflow.i32(i32 %0, i32 %1), !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %3 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %2, 0, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %4 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %2, 1, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %5 = xor i1 %4, true, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 br i1 %5, label %cont, label %trap, !dbg !29, !prof !30, !nosanitize !21trap: ; preds = %entry call void @llvm.ubsantrap(i8 0) #4, !dbg !31, !nosanitize !21 unreachable, !dbg !31, !nosanitize !21cont: ; preds = %entry ret i32 %3, !dbg !34};...!29 = !DILocation(line: 5, column: 13, scope: !17)!30 = !{!&#34;branch_weights&#34;, i32 1048575, i32 1}!31 = !DILocation(line: 0, scope: !32, inlinedAt: !29)!32 = distinct !DISubprogram(name: &#34;__clang_trap_msg$Undefined Behavior Sanitizer$Integer addition overflowed&#34;, scope: !2, file: !2, type: !33, flags: DIFlagArtificial, spFlags: DISPFlagDefinition, unit: !14)</code></pre><p>The debug metadata for the <code>@llvm.ubsantrap</code> call is <code>!31</code>. That <code>DILocation</code> has the scope of the <code>DISubprogram</code> assigned to <code>!32</code> which is the artificial function which encodes the trap category. This function&rsquo;s name is formatted as <code>__clang_trap_msg$&lt;Category&gt;$&lt;TrapMessage&gt;</code> to encode the trap category (<code>Undefined Behavior Sanitizer</code>) and the specific message (<code>Integer addition overflowed</code>). This function does not actually exist in the compiled program. It only exists in the debug info as a convenient way to describe the reason for trapping. When a trap is hit in the debugger, the debugger retrieves this string from the debug info and shows it as the reason for trapping.</p><p>Note that the <code>DILocation</code> for <code>!31</code> has <code>inlinedAt:</code> which tells us that the trap was inlined from <code>!32</code> into the location at <code>!29</code> which is the location of the <code>a + b</code> expression in the <code>add</code> function.</p><p>I implemented this change on this <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967">PR</a>.</p><h3 id="debug-info-size-changes">Debug info size changes</h3><p>One concern that a reviewer had was the debug info size difference. This was one of the motivations for putting this feature under the new <code>-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code> flag because initially (prior to code review), my mentors and I planned to have the trap feature flag accompany the <code>-fsanitize-trap=</code> flag. Although the <code>-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code> flag is on by default (so long as trapping UBSan is enabled), having the trap reason feature under a flag allows users to opt-out by using the <code>-fno-sanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code> flag.</p><p>Using bloaty, I tested a release build of clang with the <code>-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code> flag enabled, and one with it disabled (<code>-fno-sanitize-debug-trap-reasons</code>).

      <source:markdown>## Introduction

My name is Anthony and I had the pleasure of working on improving the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer this Google Summer of Code 2025. My mentors were Dan Liew and Michael Buch.

## Background

Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan) is a tool for detecting a subset of the undefined behaviors in the C, C++, and Objective-C languages at runtime. This project focused mainly on the trapping variant of UBSan, which is evoked through `-fsanitize-trap=&#60;...&#62;` along with `-fsanitize=&#60;...&#62;`. Trapping UBSan is a lighter-weight version of UBSan because upon detection of undefined behavior a trap instruction is executed rather than calling into a runtime library to handle the undefined behavior. This makes it more appealing for kernel, embedded, and production hardening use cases. For cases of undefined behavior that can be detected by UBSan, check out the [official clang documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html).

An issue with trapping UBSan prior to my work was that it was much harder to debug undefined behavior when it is detected when compared to the non-trapping mode. To illustrate this consider this C program that reads integers from the command line arguments and adds them.

```
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;int add(int a, int b) { return a + b;}int main(int argc, const char** argv) { if (argc &#60; 3) return 1; int a = atoi(argv[1]); int b = atoi(argv[2]); int result = add(a, b); printf(&#34;Added %d + %d = %d\n&#34;, a, b, result); return 0;}
```

If this program is compiled and executed using UBSan with its userspace runtime it provides helpful output diagnosing the problem and also allows execution to continue.

```
$ bin/clang -fsanitize=undefined add.c -g -o add &#38;&#38; ./add 2147483647 1add.c:5:13: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 2147483647 + 1 cannot be represented in type &#39;int&#39;SUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior add.c:5:13 Added 2147483647 + 1 = -2147483648
```

In contrast when using UBSan in trapping mode the program immediately terminates when undefined behavior is detected as shown below.

```
$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o add &#38;&#38; ./add 2147483647 1[1] 54357 trace trap ./add 2147483647 1
```

This is the expected behavior of trapping mode but how should a developer debug what happened when a trap is hit? If we attach a debugger and run the example program this is the output LLDB shows.

```
$ lldb ./add -- 2147483647 1 (lldb) target create &#34;./add&#34;(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args &#34;2147483647&#34; &#34;1&#34;(lldb) rProcess 17347 launched: &#39;add&#39; (arm64)Process 17347 stopped* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = EXC_BREAKPOINT (code=1, subcode=0x100003d3c) frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 2 #include &#60;stdio.h&#62; 3 4 int add(int a, int b) {-&#62; 5 return a + b; 6 } 7 8 int main(int argc, const char** argv) {(lldb) bt* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = EXC_BREAKPOINT (code=1, subcode=0x100003d3c) * frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 frame #1: 0x0000000100003eec add`main(argc=3, argv=0x000000016fdff110) at add.c:13:18 frame #2: 0x00000001842bab98 dyld`start + 6076(lldb) dis -padd`add:-&#62; 0x100003d3c &#60;+40&#62;: brk #0x5500 0x100003d40 &#60;+44&#62;: ldr w0, [sp, #0x4] 0x100003d44 &#60;+48&#62;: add sp, sp, #0x10 0x100003d48 &#60;+52&#62;: ret
```

We can see that a `brk` instruction was hit while handling the `a + b` expression but there is no good explanation of what happened. `brk` is the trap instruction on arm64 but it is not particularly clear this has anything to do with UBSan. For this toy example we can speculate that integer overflow occurred because the program was built with trapping UBSan and the trap was hit while handling `a + b`. However, in real programs built with trapping UBSan and potentially other hardening mechanisms it is often far less obvious what happened.

For this particular example. The information that this is an integer overflow UBSan check is actually there but it is not very obvious. On x86\_64 and arm64 the reason for trapping is actually [encoded in the operand to the trap instruction](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-01-29-all-about-undefined-behavior-sanitizer). In this case the `#0x5500` immediate to the brk instruction encodes that this is a UBSan trap for integer overflow. The UBSan immediate is encoded as `(&#39;U&#39; &#60;&#60; 8) + SanitizerHandler` where [`SanitizerHandler` is the enum value from the `SanitizerHandler` enum inside Clang’s internals](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/96195e7d44613e272475c90df187678036f21966/clang/lib/CodeGen/SanitizerHandler.h#L78).

As we can see the debugging experience with UBSan traps is not ideal and improving this was the primary goal of the GSoC project.

## Human readable descriptions of UBSan traps in LLDB

The natural place to tackle the debugging experience was to look at debugger integration.

### Let the debugger handle most of the work

One approach to this would be to teach debuggers (e.g. LLDB) to decode the trap reason encoded in trap instructions in the debugger. However, this approach wasn’t taken for several reasons:

- Using the trap reason encoded in trap instructions only works for x86\_64 and arm64. The approach that I used works for all targets where debug info is supported (many more).

- Relying on decoding the trap reason encoded in the trap instruction creates a tight coupling between the compiler and the debugger because if the encoding ever changes:

  - The debugger would need to be changed to adapt to the new encoding.

  - Older versions of the debugger would fail to work with binaries using the new encoding.

  - New versions of the debugger would fail to work with binaries using the old encoding.
- In contrast, encoding the trap reason as a string in the debug info is a much looser coupling because the compiler is free to change the trap reason without changes to the debugger.


### Encoding the trap reason in the debug info

The approach I took is based on how `__builtin_verbose_trap` encodes its message into debug info \[11\] \[12\], a feature which was implemented in the past for [libc++ hardening](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-hardening-in-libc/73925). The core idea is that the trap reason string gets encoded directly in the trap’s debug information.

To accomplish this, we needed to find a place to “stuff” the string in the DWARF DIE tree. Using a `DW_TAG_subprogram` was deemed the most straightforward and space-efficient location. This means we create a synthetic `DISubprogram` which is not a real function in the compiled program; it exists only in the debug info as a container. While the string could have been placed elsewhere, for reasons outside the scope of this blog post, it resides on this fake function DIE, with the trap reason encoded in the `DW_TAG_subprogram`’s name. For a deeper dive into this design decision, you can see [\[15\]](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967#issuecomment-3054319138).

Let’s look at the LLVM IR of the previous example to see how this is implemented:

```
$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o - -o - -S -emit-llvm -fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons=basic; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind optnone ssp uwtable(sync)define i32 @add(i32 noundef %a, i32 noundef %b) #0 !dbg !17 !func_sanitize !22 {entry: %a.addr = alloca i32, align 4 %b.addr = alloca i32, align 4 store i32 %a, ptr %a.addr, align 4 #dbg_declare(ptr %a.addr, !23, !DIExpression(), !24) store i32 %b, ptr %b.addr, align 4 #dbg_declare(ptr %b.addr, !25, !DIExpression(), !26) %0 = load i32, ptr %a.addr, align 4, !dbg !27 %1 = load i32, ptr %b.addr, align 4, !dbg !28 %2 = call { i32, i1 } @llvm.sadd.with.overflow.i32(i32 %0, i32 %1), !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %3 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %2, 0, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %4 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %2, 1, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 %5 = xor i1 %4, true, !dbg !29, !nosanitize !21 br i1 %5, label %cont, label %trap, !dbg !29, !prof !30, !nosanitize !21trap: ; preds = %entry call void @llvm.ubsantrap(i8 0) #4, !dbg !31, !nosanitize !21 unreachable, !dbg !31, !nosanitize !21cont: ; preds = %entry ret i32 %3, !dbg !34};...!29 = !DILocation(line: 5, column: 13, scope: !17)!30 = !{!&#34;branch_weights&#34;, i32 1048575, i32 1}!31 = !DILocation(line: 0, scope: !32, inlinedAt: !29)!32 = distinct !DISubprogram(name: &#34;__clang_trap_msg$Undefined Behavior Sanitizer$Integer addition overflowed&#34;, scope: !2, file: !2, type: !33, flags: DIFlagArtificial, spFlags: DISPFlagDefinition, unit: !14)
```

The debug metadata for the `@llvm.ubsantrap` call is `!31`. That `DILocation` has the scope of the `DISubprogram` assigned to `!32` which is the artificial function which encodes the trap category. This function’s name is formatted as `__clang_trap_msg$&#60;Category&#62;$&#60;TrapMessage&#62;` to encode the trap category ( `Undefined Behavior Sanitizer`) and the specific message ( `Integer addition overflowed`). This function does not actually exist in the compiled program. It only exists in the debug info as a convenient way to describe the reason for trapping. When a trap is hit in the debugger, the debugger retrieves this string from the debug info and shows it as the reason for trapping.

Note that the `DILocation` for `!31` has `inlinedAt:` which tells us that the trap was inlined from `!32` into the location at `!29` which is the location of the `a + b` expression in the `add` function.

I implemented this change on this [PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967).

### Debug info size changes

One concern that a reviewer had was the debug info size difference. This was one of the motivations for putting this feature under the new `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` flag because initially (prior to code review), my mentors and I planned to have the trap feature flag accompany the `-fsanitize-trap=` flag. Although the `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` flag is on by default (so long as trapping UBSan is enabled), having the trap reason feature under a flag allows users to opt-out by using the `-fno-sanitize-debug-trap-reasons` flag.

Using bloaty, I tested a release build of clang with the `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` flag enabled, and one with it disabled ( `-fno-sanitize-debug-trap-reasons`). We found that the size difference was negligible; results are below.

```
 FILE SIZE VM SIZE -------------- -------------- +0.3% +6.01Mi +0.3% +6.01Mi ,__debug_info +2.0% +2.26Mi [ = ] 0 [Unmapped] +1.2% +1.35Mi +1.2% +1.35Mi ,__apple_names +0.0% +1.01Mi +0.0% +1.01Mi ,__debug_str +0.8% +636Ki +0.8% +635Ki ,__debug_line +0.4% +161Ki +0.4% +161Ki ,__debug_ranges +0.4% +47.9Ki +0.4% +47.9Ki ,__debug_abbrev +0.0% +14 +0.0% +14 ,__apple_types [ = ] 0 +0.0% +8 ,__common [ = ] 0 +7.1% +4 ,__thread_bss -0.0% -4 -0.0% -4 ,__const -0.0% -1.27Ki -0.0% -1.27Ki ,__cstring +0.2% +11.5Mi +0.1% +9.19Mi TOTAL
```

Note it is likely the code size difference is negligible because because in optimized builds trap instructions in a function get merged together which causes the additional debug info my patch adds to be dropped.

Realistically this will add a few more abbreviations into .debug\_abbrev (the DWARF abbreviation section) and only a few extra bytes per-UBSAN trap (abbreviation code + 1 ULEB128 for the index into the string offset table) into .debug\_info (the DWARF debug-info section). The rest of the DW\_TAG\_subprogram is encoded in the abbreviation for that fake frame [\[16\]](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145967#issuecomment-3068862442). It would also be contingent on the number of traps emitted since a new `DW_TAG_subprogram` DIE is emitted for each trap with this new feature. [A later comparison on a larger code base (“Big Google Binary”)](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154618#issuecomment-3225724300), actually found a rather significant size increase of about 18% with trap reasons enabled. Future work may involve looking into why this is happening, and how such drastic size increases can be reduced.

### Displaying the trap reason in the debugger

With the support in the compiler for encoding the trap reasons for UBSan implemented I then turned my attention to displaying these in the LLDB debugger.

In this particular case nothing new needs to be implemented in LLDB because the `VerboseTrapFrameRecognizer` in LLDB which was implemented for `__builtin_verbose_trap` is general enough that it already supports any artificial function in the debug info of the form `__clang_trap_msg$&#60;Category&#62;$&#60;TrapMessage&#62;`.

So if we take the running example and run it under LLDB, its output now looks like.

```
$ clang -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined add.c -g -o add$ lldb ./add -- 2147483647 1(lldb) target create &#34;add&#34;(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args &#34;2147483647&#34; &#34;1&#34;(lldb) rProcess 81705 launched: &#39;/add&#39; (arm64)Process 81705 stopped* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = Undefined Behavior Sanitizer: Integer addition overflowed frame #1: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 2 #include &#60;stdio.h&#62; 3 4 int add(int a, int b) {-&#62; 5 return a + b; 6 } 7 8 int main(int argc, const char** argv) {(lldb) bt* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = Undefined Behavior Sanitizer: Integer addition overflowed frame #0: 0x0000000100003d3c add`__clang_trap_msg$Undefined Behavior Sanitizer$Integer addition overflowed at add.c:0 [inlined] * frame #1: 0x0000000100003d3c add`add(a=2147483647, b=1) at add.c:5:13 frame #2: 0x0000000100003eec add`main(argc=3, argv=0x000000016fdff110) at add.c:13:18 frame #3: 0x00000001842bab98 dyld`start + 6076(lldb) dis -padd`__clang_trap_msg$Undefined Behavior Sanitizer$Integer addition overflowed:-&#62; 0x100003d3c &#60;+40&#62;: brk #0x5500 0x100003d40 &#60;+44&#62;: ldr w0, [sp, #0x4] 0x100003d44 &#60;+48&#62;: add sp, sp, #0x10 0x100003d48 &#60;+52&#62;: ret
```

Notice that:

The stop reason now shows as `Undefined Behavior Sanitizer: Integer addition overflowed`. Previously no helpful stop reason was shown.We are stopped with `frame #1` selected and the artificial frame ( `frame #0`) is present in the backtrace. LLDB does this so stopping is not shown in the artificial function which would be confusing.The `dis -pc` output claims we are inside the artificial function. This is an artifact of the implementation that is a little confusing but worth the trade-off.

So for this portion of my GSoC project the only thing I need to do was added a test case to ensure LLDB behaved appropriately. This was done on [this PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/151231).

## RFC: Add a warning when `-fsanitize=` is passed without associated `-fsanitize-trap=`

The next part of my GSoC project was to post an RFC and implement a sketch fix for a usability problem with trapping UBSan.

Currently, clang does not warn about cases where `-fsanitize-trap=` does nothing (silent no-op), particularly [in the case where `-fsanitize-trap=` is passed without `-fsanitize=`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html#id5):

Ex:

`$ clang -fsanitize-trap=undefined foo.c`

Emits no warning, even though `-fsanitize-trap=undefined` is not doing anything here.

We thought it would be more user-friendly to add a warning for such cases, but due to some [initial community pushback](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/clang-gsoc-2025-usability-improvements-for-trapping-undefined-behavior-sanitizer/84568/11), it was decided that an RFC should be opened. I ended up writing a [sketch patch that emitted a warning for such cases](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/147997).

Ex:

`$ clang -fsanitize-trap=undefined foo.c`

Would now emit:

`warning: -fsanitize-trap=undefined has no effect because the &#34;undefined&#34; sanitizer is disabled; consider passing &#34;-fsanitize=undefined&#34; to enable the sanitizer`

Unfortunately, we found that the emission of such warnings could become exceedingly complicated and a point of contention due to the existence of sanitizer groups, subgroups, and individual sanitizers. Determining the correct behavior for various cases, historical precedence with no-ops, interference with current build systems, prioritization of existing build systems over the user experience, and compatibility with gcc led to the end of [the RFC](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-emit-a-warning-when-fsanitize-trap-is-passed-without-associated-fsanitize/87893).

## Expand upon the hard-coded strings in `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` to be more specific

There were two initial design decisions to pick from here. Either I could:

**(a)** Use some string formatting, such as LLVM’s formatvariadic or raw\_ostream. For some implementation context, the function in which the trap messages were generated was called in a function called `EmitTrapCheck`, so the idea was to pass down extra information from earlier in the call stack before `EmitTrapCheck` was called.

or

**(b)** Extend clang’s diagnostic system to accomodate trap reasons. This is explained further below.

Due to the time it took to complete the first two tasks, I chose the first option. I deemed the second option to be a large commitment that I wouldn’t have been able to do by the end of the GSoC coding period. Additionally, I was unsure if building on top of the diagnostics subsystem would be approved since diagnostics were originally intended to emit messages within the command line, not debug info.

After taking some time to investigate possible cases where extra information in trap messages could be useful, I put up [a PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153845). The patch was admittedly quite messy, so to take a cleaner approach that was more aligned with clang’s frontend, one of my mentors, Dan, ended up following through with option (b) to [create the extension to the clang diagnostics subsystem to work with trap messages](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154618). By extending the diagnostics subsystem, it allows us to leverage the powerful string formatting engine of the diagnostics system.

However, this doesn’t mean that the effort used to write proper hard-coded trap messages under `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons` was thrown away. Rather as of [Dan’s patch](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154618), the flag now has two options: `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons=basic` for the hard-coded trap messages and `-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons=detailed` for the detailed trap messages which utilize the trap reasons diagnostics API. This was done in case users did not want to deal with the larger binary sizes that came with the trap reasons.

## What I’ve Learned

Before I started this GSoC, I barely even knew how to build clang and LLVM or use git in a large open-source project. My mentors showed me the ropes on a lot of things (particularly how to properly use git and build and configure clang), and I came out of this summer knowing a lot more of how to get my changes properly reviewed and upstreamed. I was also able to get a firmer understanding of the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer, better C++ programming practices, and the LLVM codebase.

## Work to Do

As stated prior, some research needs to be conducted to figure out how size increase can be minimalized.

Also stated previously, the diagnostics extension for trap messages has been [upstreamed by Dan](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154618). As of right now, only signed and unsigned overflow for addition, subtraction, and multiplication are being used by this system. I plan to integrate what I found on my [abandoned PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153845) by building on top of what Dan has already done. This will be done after the GSoC coding period.

There is [an issue](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/150707) where trap messages are not emitted in cases where they should be due to a null check. The purpose of the null check was to prevent a nullptr dereference that occurred in the debug-info prologue. This is a known issue to which there isn’t a concrete solution as of current.

## Conclusion

I want to give a special thanks to my mentors, Dan and Michael, for being there for me the whole way. They helped a lot with guiding me through git, the LLVM code base, and even this blog post. I appreciate their commitment to the project and their patience with me.

I’m incredibly grateful that I was able to work on this project and I wouldn’t have traded it for anything else. Being a beginner to both LLVM and open-source, I have to admit I was overwhelmed at first, but slowly, along with their help, I was able to gain at least a semblance of understanding of how things worked. I could not have asked for a better set of mentors, so again, a huge thanks to them. I want to also extend my gratitude to the LLVM Foundation for this opportunity.

I’ve had a lot of fun with this project and I hope to contribute more to LLVM, or in open-source in general, in the future.

      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/more-control-equals-less-performance/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I’ve been thinking about <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-07-18T0946" >a note</a> from Alex Russell where he says:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>any time you&#39;re running JS on the main thread, you&#39;re at risk of being left behind by progress.</p>
        <p>The zen of web development is to spend a little time in your own code, and instead to glue the big C++/Rust subsystems together, then <em>get out of the bloody way.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In his thread on Bluesky, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/infrequently.org/post/3lu7j6gwjf2cd" >Alex continues</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>How do we do this? Using the declarative systems that connect to those big piles of C++/Rust: CSS for the compositor (including scrolling &amp; animations), HTML parser to build DOM, and for various media, dishing off to the high-level systems in ways that don&#39;t call back into your JS.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I keep thinking about this difference:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I need to write code that does X.</li>
        <li>I need to write code that calls a browser API to do X.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There’s a big difference between A) making suggestions for the browser, and B) being its <a href="https://bell.bz/be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager/" >micromanager</a>.</p>
        <p>Hence the title: you can write code that will run in the browser, or you can write code that calls the browser to run.</p>
        <h2 id="a-few-examples">A Few Examples</h2>
        <p>So what are the browser ‘subsystems’ I can glue together? What are some examples of things I can ask the browser to do rather than doing them myself?</p>
        <p>A examples come to mind:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>View transitions API (instead of JS DOM diffing and manual animation).</li>
        <li>CSS transitions or <code>@keyframes</code> (GPU-accelerated) vs. manual JS with <code>setInterval</code> updates.</li>
        <li><code>scroll-behavior: smooth</code> in CSS vs. JS scroll logic.</li>
        <li>CSS grid or flexbox vs. JS layout engines (e.g., Masonry clones).</li>
        <li><code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> elements with native decoding and hardware acceleration vs. JS media players.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> with <code>srcset</code> for responsive images vs. manual image swapping logic in JS.</li>
        <li>Built-in form state (<code>formData</code>) and validation (<code>required</code>, <code>pattern</code>, etc.) vs. JS-based state, tracking, and validation logic.</li>

      <source:markdown>I’ve been thinking about [a note](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-07-18T0946) from Alex Russell where he says:

&#62; any time you&#39;re running JS on the main thread, you&#39;re at risk of being left behind by progress.
&#62;
&#62; The zen of web development is to spend a little time in your own code, and instead to glue the big C++/Rust subsystems together, then _get out of the bloody way._

In his thread on Bluesky, [Alex continues](https://bsky.app/profile/infrequently.org/post/3lu7j6gwjf2cd):

&#62; How do we do this? Using the declarative systems that connect to those big piles of C++/Rust: CSS for the compositor (including scrolling &#38; animations), HTML parser to build DOM, and for various media, dishing off to the high-level systems in ways that don&#39;t call back into your JS.

I keep thinking about this difference:

- I need to write code that does X.
- I need to write code that calls a browser API to do X.

There’s a big difference between A) making suggestions for the browser, and B) being its [micromanager](https://bell.bz/be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager/).

Hence the title: you can write code that will run in the browser, or you can write code that calls the browser to run.

## A Few Examples

So what are the browser ‘subsystems’ I can glue together? What are some examples of things I can ask the browser to do rather than doing them myself?

A examples come to mind:

- View transitions API (instead of JS DOM diffing and manual animation).
- CSS transitions or `@keyframes` (GPU-accelerated) vs. manual JS with `setInterval` updates.
- `scroll-behavior: smooth` in CSS vs. JS scroll logic.
- CSS grid or flexbox vs. JS layout engines (e.g., Masonry clones).
- `&#60;video&#62;` and `&#60;audio&#62;` elements with native decoding and hardware acceleration vs. JS media players.
- `&#60;picture&#62;` or `&#60;img&#62;` with `srcset` for responsive images vs. manual image swapping logic in JS.
- Built-in form state ( `formData`) and validation ( `required`, `pattern`, etc.) vs. JS-based state, tracking, and validation logic.
- Native elements like `&#60;details&#62;`, `&#60;dialog&#62;`, `&#60;select&#62;`, etc., which provide built-in keyboard and accessibility behavior vs. custom ARIA-heavy components.

## Going Galaxy Brain

![Galaxy brain meme from top to bottom: setTimeout -&#62; requestAnimationFrame -&#62; document.startViewTransition -&#62; @view-transition](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/galaxy-brain-animation.jpg)

The trick is to let go of your need for control. Say to yourself, “If I don’t micromanage the browser on this task and am willing to let go of control, in return it will choose how to do this itself with lower-level APIs that are more performant than anything I can write.”

For example, here are some approaches to animating transitions on the web where each step moves more responsibility from your JavaScript code on the main thread to the browser’s rendering engine:

- `setTimeout`
  - JS timers, DOM manipulation, browser repaints when it can. Dropped frames.
- `requestAnimationFrame`
  - Syncs to browser repaint cycle. Smooth, but you gotta handle a lot yourself (diffing, cleanup, etc.)
- View Transitions in JS
  - JS triggers, browser snapshots and animates. Native performance, but requires custom choreography on your part.
- View Transitions in CSS
  - Declare what you expect broadly, then let the browser take over.

It’s a scale from:

I want the most control, and in exchange I’ll worry about performance.

To:

I don’t need control, and in exchange you’ll worry about performance.

I don’t know about you, but I’d much rather hand over performance, accessibility, localization, and a whole host of issues to the experts who build browsers.

## It’s Trade-offs All the Way Down

Building on the web is a set of choices:

- Do it yourself.
- Let the browser do it.
- Somewhere in between.

Anytime you choose to do something yourself, you’re choosing to make a trade-off. Often that increase in control comes at the cost of a degradation in performance.

Why do it yourself? Often it’s because you want a specific amount of control over the experience you’re creating. That may be perfectly ok! But it should be a deliberate choice, not because you didn’t consider (or know) the browser offers you an alternative. Maybe it does!

So instead of asking yourself, “How can I write code that does what I want?” Consider asking yourself, “Can I write code that ties together things the browser already does to accomplish what I want (or close enough to it)?”

Building this way will likely improve your performance dramatically — not to mention decrease your maintenance burden dramatically!

      <source:markdown>No, honest, it did.

Windows 2 was kinda ugly.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win203](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win203)

Windows 3/3.1/3.11 were fine.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win30](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win30)

Muted, boring, but you could look at it all day. And we did.

95 improved it.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win95osr2](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win95osr2)

Tasteful greys, spot colour.

NT 4 improved that a bit more.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/winnt40](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/winnt40)

Categorised Start menu, for instance. But nearly identical.

95/NT4 were visibly inspired by NeXTstep, IMHO the most beautiful GUI ever written.

Then it all started to go a bit wrong. The first pebbles bouncing down the mountainside presaging a vast avalanche.

Windows 98.

[https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win98](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win98)

IE4 built in so Microsoft didn&#39;t get broken up my the US DOJ. Explorer rendered local content via HTML. Ugly extra toolbars. Some floating, some embedded in the task bar. Ugly gradients and blends in window title bars.

Cheap and plastic and tacky.

_But_ that is around the time that media and gaming PCs went mainstream, home internet use (often over dialup) went mainstream, and the alternatives died out (Amiga, ST &#38; GEM, Arm &#38; RISC OS) or very nearly died (classic MacOS, NeXT merger, Rhapsody).

So it&#39;s what many saw first and loved and remembered.

Result, people write entire new OSes designed in affectionate homage:

[https://serenityos.org/](https://serenityos.org/)

Look at the toolbars. Look at the textures in the title bars. This isn&#39;t Win9x, this is specifically Win98.

[https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/i...](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/index.htm)

Specifically:

[https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/h...](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/hansen1.jpg)

&#60;\- textured title bars

[https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/t...](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/tinypanel.jpg)

&#60;\- gradients in title bars

[https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/m...](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/screenshots/KDE%201-x/matthiase2.jpg)

&#60;\- Windows-style colour schemes

KDE started out as a reproduction of Windows 98/98SE by a team who didn&#39;t realise that what they were looking at was WordPerfect 5.x instead of WordPerfect 4.x -- as the late great Guy Kewney put it:

&#34;WordPerfect 4.2 was a bicycle. A great bicycle. Everyone agreed it was a great bicycle, just about _the_ best. So what Wordperfect did was, they put together a committee, looked at the market, and said: &#39;what we&#39;ll do is, we&#39;ll put 11 more wheels on it&#39;.&#34;

Win98 is Win95 festooned with pointless needless Internet widgetry because the DOJ was about to split MS into separate apps and OS companies, because MS drove Netscape into bankruptcy by bundling IE free of charge with Windows.

Strip all that junk off and what&#39;s left underneath is a better UI. But the German kids writing their &#34;Kool Desktop Environment&#34; didn&#39;t realise.

After that came WinME and Windows 2000, which turned down the bling a bit as the lawsuit was over, but it was only a blip.

Then came XP with its &#34;Fischer-Price&#34; themes.

Then Vista with gratuitous transparency everywhere because GDI.EXE had been ripped out and replaced with a compositor and that&#39;s no fun if you don&#39;t use some 3D features like see-through stuff.

Then 7 toned that down a bit and everyone love it.

Then the universally detested Win8, and then that was toned down and the Start menu put back for Win10, which is roughly what UKUI and Deepin copied in China, or Wubuntu in the West.

Then Win11, as copied by AnduinOS and a few others, which for this long-term Windows user is the worst release ever. I can&#39;t even have a vertical taskbar any more. It&#39;s abhorrent.

        <![CDATA[<p>Regular readers know that I maintain <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/"><code>gssr</code></a> and <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/"><code>gssrdoc</code></a>, two packages for <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>. The former makes the <a href="http://gss.norc.org/">General Social Survey</a>&rsquo;s annual, cumulative and panel datasets available in a way that&rsquo;s easy to use in R. The latter makes the survey&rsquo;s codebook available in R&rsquo;s integrated help system in a way that documents every GSS variable as if it were a function or object in R, so you can query them in exactly the same way as any function from the R console or in the IDE of your choice. As a bonus, because I use <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org"><code>pkgdown</code></a> to document the packages, I get a website as a side-effect. In the case of <code>gssrdoc</code> this means <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/reference/index.html">a browsable index of all the GSS variables</a>. The GSS is the Hubble Space Telescope of American social science; our longest-running representative view of many aspects of the character and opinions of American households. The data is <a href="https://gss.norc.org">freely available from NORC</a>, but they distribute it in SPSS, SAS, and STATA formats. I wrote these packages in an effort to make it more easily available in <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>. If you want to know the relationship between these various platforms, <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2019/02/07/statswars/">I have you covered</a>. But the important thing is that R is a free and open-source project, and the others are not.</p>
        <p>This week I spent a little time updating <code>gssrdoc</code> a bit to clean up how the help pages looked and make some other improvements. Inside R, you can say, e.g., <code>?govdook</code> at the console and have this pop up in the help:</p>

            <img src="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-rstudio.png"
                 alt="RStudio with help page for govdook"/></a><figcaption>
                    <p>Yeah govdook is short for &lsquo;Gov Do OK&rsquo;, not &lsquo;Go v Dook&rsquo;.</p>
                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The package also includes <code>gss_doc</code>, a data frame containing all of the information that the help pages are built from. I included it because it can be useful to work with directly, as when you might want to extract summary information about a subset of variables.</p>

        <p>The <code>gss_doc</code> object has regular columns but also a series of <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html">list-columns</a> to (insert meme here, you know the one) put data frames inside your data frames. (They&rsquo;re labeled as &ldquo;<a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org">tibbles</a>&rdquo; here; basically the same thing).</p>
        <p>Why a list-column? Why a list? Well, a list is one of the fundamental ways to store data of any sort. Lists are useful because they can contain heterogeneous elements:</p>

        <p>One thing to notice about a list like this is that it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to represent it as a table.

        <p>In its bones, R is a LISP/Scheme-like list-processing language fused with features of classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming">array languages</a> like APL. This is because, in the world of data analysis, what we deal with all the time are rectangular tables, or arrays, where rows are cases and columns are different sorts of variables. The wrinkle is that, unlike a beautiful array of pure numbers, each column might measure something (a date, a True/False answer, a location, a score, a nationality) that we&rsquo;d prefer not to represent directly as a number. Sure, underneath in the computer everything is all just ones and zeros. (Or rather, electromagnetic patterns in some physical substrate that we can interpret as meaning ones and zeros.) And if we want to do any sort of data analysis that involves treating our table as a matrix then we&rsquo;ll want numeric representations of all the columns. But for many uses we&rsquo;d like to see &ldquo;France&rdquo; or &ldquo;Strongly Agree&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;33&rdquo; or &ldquo;5&rdquo;. Just a table of rows and columns, where different things can be represented across columns, but any particular column is all the same kind of thing.</p>
        <p>A rectangular table like that is called a data frame. One way to think of a data frame is just as a special case of a list. A data frame is a list where you can put all the list elements side by side and treat them as columns, and where all these elements are made of vectors of the same length. Beyond that, it&rsquo;s a list where the nth element of each vector refers to some property of the same underlying entity, i.e. the thing that&rsquo;s in the row, or case; the thing the columns are showing you measurements or properties of. You can have empty entries if needed, as when some bit of data is missing. The important thing is that each column has as many slots as there are cases, and you fill in the values for each case in the same slot in each column. Whenever you look at any table of data, one of your first questions should always be &ldquo;What is a row in this table?&rdquo; In this case, each row is a variable in the full GSS dataset, and each column describes some property of that variable.</p>

        <p>Because R was designed by statisticians&mdash;R is a descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)">S</a>, which like everything else in computing traces its origins to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)">Bell Labs</a>&mdash;it has this concept of a data frame built-in to its core instead of being bolted-on afterwards, which is extremely handy. Normally data frames are just ordinary rectangles, but there&rsquo;s no reason why any particular column can&rsquo;t itself be thought of as a list of something else. That&rsquo;s what we have here. The <code>yr_vartab</code> column contains data frames of crosstabs of the answers to each question by year. Except where it doesn&rsquo;t (e.g. for <code>id</code>), and this is fine because lists don&rsquo;t have to be internally homogeneous. Similarly <code>yrballot_df</code> has a little table of which ballots, or internal portions of the survey, a question was asked on for each year it was asked.</p>
        <p>The upshot is that having assembled the <code>gss_doc</code> object we can use it to emit, like, seven thousand pages of documentation on the GSS&rsquo;s many, many questions over the years. We can build them as standardized R help pages, as above. On the <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/index.html">website</a> that <code>pgkdown</code> builds for us, we get this:</p>

                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The cross-referencing to other relevant variables in the &ldquo;See Also&rdquo; section is new in this version. It comes courtesy of the GSS&rsquo;s own information about survey modules and an ad hoc topic index they keep for the variables. I just use a subset of possible cross-references as we don&rsquo;t want, e.g., every single question in the GSS core to be cross-referenced to every other core question on any particular help page. On the website, I gather these into a <a href="https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/articles/topics.html">single page</a>:</p>

                </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The GSS has its own handy <a href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org">data explorer</a> which is very useful for quickly checking on particular trends and getting a quick graph of what the data look like, or a summary view of the content of particular variables. Each help page in <code>gssrdoc</code> now links to the GSS Data Explorer page for that variable, in case you want to hop over and take a look there. Of course, the <code>gssrdoc</code> package doesn&rsquo;t and isn&rsquo;t meant to replace the Data Explorer; it&rsquo;s just a different view of the same information, with a different use-case in mind.</p>]]>
      </description>
      <source:markdown>Regular readers know that I maintain [`gssr`](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/) and [`gssrdoc`](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/), two packages for [R](https://www.r-project.org). The former makes the [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org/)’s annual, cumulative and panel datasets available in a way that’s easy to use in R. The latter makes the survey’s codebook available in R’s integrated help system in a way that documents every GSS variable as if it were a function or object in R, so you can query them in exactly the same way as any function from the R console or in the IDE of your choice. As a bonus, because I use [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org) to document the packages, I get a website as a side-effect. In the case of `gssrdoc` this means [a browsable index of all the GSS variables](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/reference/index.html). The GSS is the Hubble Space Telescope of American social science; our longest-running representative view of many aspects of the character and opinions of American households. The data is [freely available from NORC](https://gss.norc.org), but they distribute it in SPSS, SAS, and STATA formats. I wrote these packages in an effort to make it more easily available in [R](https://www.r-project.org). If you want to know the relationship between these various platforms, [I have you covered](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2019/02/07/statswars/). But the important thing is that R is a free and open-source project, and the others are not.

This week I spent a little time updating `gssrdoc` a bit to clean up how the help pages looked and make some other improvements. Inside R, you can say, e.g., `?govdook` at the console and have this pop up in the help:

[![RStudio with help page for govdook](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-rstudio.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-rstudio.png)

Yeah govdook is short for ‘Gov Do OK’, not ‘Go v Dook’.

The package also includes `gss_doc`, a data frame containing all of the information that the help pages are built from. I included it because it can be useful to work with directly, as when you might want to extract summary information about a subset of variables.

The `gss_doc` object has regular columns but also a series of [list-columns](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html) to (insert meme here, you know the one) put data frames inside your data frames. (They’re labeled as “ [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org)” here; basically the same thing).

Why a list-column? Why a list? Well, a list is one of the fundamental ways to store data of any sort. Lists are useful because they can contain heterogeneous elements:

```
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

```

```r
items &#60;- list(
  todo_home = c(&#34;Laundry&#34;, &#34;Clean bathroom&#34;, &#34;Feed cat&#34;, &#34;Bring out rubbish bins&#34;),
  important_dates = as.Date(c(&#34;1776-07-04&#34;, &#34;1788-06-21&#34;, &#34;2025-01-18&#34;)),
  keycode = 8675309,
  storage_tiers = c(128, 256, 512, 1024)
)

items
#&#62; $todo_home
#&#62; [1] &#34;Laundry&#34;                &#34;Clean bathroom&#34;         &#34;Feed cat&#34;               &#34;Bring out rubbish bins&#34;
#&#62;
#&#62; $important_dates
#&#62; [1] &#34;1776-07-04&#34; &#34;1788-06-21&#34; &#34;2025-01-18&#34;
#&#62;

#&#62;
#&#62; $storage_tiers
#&#62; [1]  128  256  512 1024
```

One thing to notice about a list like this is that it doesn’t really make sense to represent it as a table. This is partly because the elements of the list are of different lengths, but really it’s because if we _did_ represent it as a table, it would not mean anything to read across the rows:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

```

```r
items_df
#&#62; # A tibble: 4 × 4
#&#62;   todo_home              important_dates keycode storage_tiers
#&#62;   &#60;chr&#62;                  &#60;date&#62;            &#60;int&#62;         &#60;int&#62;
#&#62; 1 Laundry                1776-07-04      8675309           128
#&#62; 2 Clean bathroom         1788-06-21           -            256
#&#62; 3 Feed cat               2025-01-18           -            512
#&#62; 4 Bring out rubbish bins -                    -           1024
```

The rows don’t form “cases” of anything. We just have four unrelated categories with various pieces of information in them.

Lists are also useful because they lend themselves easily to being nested:

```

In its bones, R is a LISP/Scheme-like list-processing language fused with features of classic [array languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming) like APL. This is because, in the world of data analysis, what we deal with all the time are rectangular tables, or arrays, where rows are cases and columns are different sorts of variables. The wrinkle is that, unlike a beautiful array of pure numbers, each column might measure something (a date, a True/False answer, a location, a score, a nationality) that we’d prefer not to represent directly as a number. Sure, underneath in the computer everything is all just ones and zeros. (Or rather, electromagnetic patterns in some physical substrate that we can interpret as meaning ones and zeros.) And if we want to do any sort of data analysis that involves treating our table as a matrix then we’ll want numeric representations of all the columns. But for many uses we’d like to see “France” or “Strongly Agree” instead of “33” or “5”. Just a table of rows and columns, where different things can be represented across columns, but any particular column is all the same kind of thing.

A rectangular table like that is called a data frame. One way to think of a data frame is just as a special case of a list. A data frame is a list where you can put all the list elements side by side and treat them as columns, and where all these elements are made of vectors of the same length. Beyond that, it’s a list where the nth element of each vector refers to some property of the same underlying entity, i.e. the thing that’s in the row, or case; the thing the columns are showing you measurements or properties of. You can have empty entries if needed, as when some bit of data is missing. The important thing is that each column has as many slots as there are cases, and you fill in the values for each case in the same slot in each column. Whenever you look at any table of data, one of your first questions should always be “What is a row in this table?” In this case, each row is a variable in the full GSS dataset, and each column describes some property of that variable.

Because R was designed by statisticians—R is a descendant of [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which like everything else in computing traces its origins to [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language))—it has this concept of a data frame built-in to its core instead of being bolted-on afterwards, which is extremely handy. Normally data frames are just ordinary rectangles, but there’s no reason why any particular column can’t itself be thought of as a list of something else. That’s what we have here. The `yr_vartab` column contains data frames of crosstabs of the answers to each question by year. Except where it doesn’t (e.g. for `id`), and this is fine because lists don’t have to be internally homogeneous. Similarly `yrballot_df` has a little table of which ballots, or internal portions of the survey, a question was asked on for each year it was asked.

The upshot is that having assembled the `gss_doc` object we can use it to emit, like, seven thousand pages of documentation on the GSS’s many, many questions over the years. We can build them as standardized R help pages, as above. On the [website](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/index.html) that `pgkdown` builds for us, we get this:

[![Website view.](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-varpage.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-varpage.png)

Website view.

The cross-referencing to other relevant variables in the “See Also” section is new in this version. It comes courtesy of the GSS’s own information about survey modules and an ad hoc topic index they keep for the variables. I just use a subset of possible cross-references as we don’t want, e.g., every single question in the GSS core to be cross-referenced to every other core question on any particular help page. On the website, I gather these into a [single page](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssrdoc/articles/topics.html):

[![Topic index page.](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-topics.png)](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2025/10/19/gssrdoc-updates/gssrdoc-topics.png)

Topic index page.

The GSS has its own handy [data explorer](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org) which is very useful for quickly checking on particular trends and getting a quick graph of what the data look like, or a summary view of the content of particular variables. Each help page in `gssrdoc` now links to the GSS Data Explorer page for that variable, in case you want to hop over and take a look there. Of course, the `gssrdoc` package doesn’t and isn’t meant to replace the Data Explorer; it’s just a different view of the same information, with a different use-case in mind.</source:markdown>
