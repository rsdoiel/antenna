      <title>The Invisibles</title>
      <link>https://adactio.com/journal/22100</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>When I was talking about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22099">monitoring web performance yesterday</a>, I linked to the <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">CrUX data for The Session</a>.</p>
        
        <p>CrUX is a contraction of Chrome User Experience Report. CrUX just sounds better than CEAR.</p>
        
        <p>It‚Äôs data gathered from actual Chrome users worldwide. It can be handy as part of a balanced performance-monitoring diet, but it‚Äôs always worth remembering that it only shows a subset of your users; those on Chrome.</p>
        
        <p>The actual CrUX data is imprisoned in some hellish Google interface so some kindly people have put more humane interfaces on it. I like <a href="https://calibreapp.com/tools/core-web-vitals-test/thesession.org">Calibre‚Äôs CrUX tool</a> as well as <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">Treo‚Äôs</a>.</p>
        
        <p>What‚Äôs nice is that you can look at the numbers for any reasonably popular website, not just your own. Lest I get too smug about the performance metrics for <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>, I can compare them to <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/en.wikipedia.org">the numbers for WikiPedia</a> or <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/www.bbc.co.uk">the BBC</a>. Both of those sites are made by people who prioritise speed, and it shows.</p>
        
        <p>If you scroll down to the numbers on navigation types, you‚Äôll see something interesting. Across the board, whether it‚Äôs The Session, Wikipedia, or the BBC, the BFcache‚Äîback/forward cache‚Äîis used around 16% to 17% of the time. This is when users use the back button (or forward button).</p>
        
        <p>Unless you do something to stop them, browsers will make sure that those navigations are super speedy. You might inadvertently be <a href="https://web.dev/articles/bfcache">sabotaging the BFcache</a> if you‚Äôre sending a <code>Cache-Control: no-store</code> header or if you‚Äôre using an <code>unload</code> event handler in JavaScript.</p>
        
        <p>I guess it‚Äôs unsurprising the BFcache numbers are relatively consistent across three different websites. People are people, whatever website they‚Äôre browsing.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">The Session</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/en.wikipedia.org">WikiPedia</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/www.bbc.co.uk">The BBC</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Where it gets interesting is in the differences. Take a look at pre-rendering. It‚Äôs 4% for the BBC and just 0.4% for Wikipedia. But on The Session it‚Äôs a whopping 35%!</p>
        
        <p>That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm using <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21139">speculation rules</a>. They‚Äôre quite straightforward to implement and they pair beautifully with full-page view transitions for a slick, speedy user experience.</p>
        
        <p>It doesn‚Äôt look like WikiPedia or the BBC are using speculation rules at all, which kind of surprises me.</p>
        
        <p>Then again, because they‚Äôre a hidden technology I can understand why they‚Äôd slip through the cracks.</p>
        
        <p>On any web project, I think it‚Äôs worth having a checklist of The Invisibles‚Äîthings that aren‚Äôt displayed directly in the browser, but that can make a big difference to the user experience.</p>
        
        <p>Some examples:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest">web application manifest</a> JSON file to help people install your website.</li>
        <li>A <a href="https://goingoffline.adactio.com/">service worker</a>, even if it‚Äôs just to cache static assets.</li>
        <li>Open Graph <a href="https://metatags.io/"><code>meta</code> elements</a> in the <code>head</code> of documents so they ‚Äúunroll‚Äù nicely when the link is shared.</li>
        <li>An appropriate <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/">content security policy</a> header.</li>
        <li>A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API"><code>Speculation-Rules</code></a> header that points to a JSON file.</li>
        <li>An <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/Guides/OpenSearch">OpenSearch XML file</a> if your site has search functionality.</li>
        <li>An icon, or as us olds call it, a favicon.</li>
        <li>A <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>body</code> of every page.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you‚Äôve got a checklist like that in place, you can at least ask ‚ÄúWhose job is this?‚Äù All too often, these things are missing because there‚Äôs no clarity on whose responsible for them. They‚Äôre sorta back-end and sorta front-end.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>A few years back, Craig wrote a great piece called <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/">Fast Software, the Best Software</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>Speed in software is probably the most valuable, least valued asset. To me, speedy software is the difference between an application smoothly integrating into your life, and one called upon with great reluctance.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Nelson Elhage said much the same thing in his <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/">reflections on software performance</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>I‚Äôve really come to appreciate that performance isn‚Äôt just some property of a tool independent from its functionality or its feature set. Performance ‚Äî in particular, being notably fast ‚Äî is a feature in and of its own right, which fundamentally alters how a tool is used and perceived.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Or, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/accessibility-and-web-performance-are-not-features-theyre-the-baseline/">as Robin put it</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>I don‚Äôt think a website can be good until it‚Äôs fast.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Those sentiments underpin <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. Speed is as much a priority as usability, accessibility, <a href="https://thesession.org/privacy">privacy</a>, and security.</p>
        
        <p>I‚Äôm fortunate in that the site doesn‚Äôt have an underlying business model at odds with these priorities. I‚Äôm under no pressure to add <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/18676">third-party code that would track users and slow down the website</a>.</p>
        
        <p>When it comes to making fast websites, most of the obstacles are put in place by front-end development, mostly JavaScript. I‚Äôve been pretty ruthless in my pursuit of speed on The Session, <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20448">removing as much JavaScript as possible</a>. On the bigger pages, the bottleneck now is DOM size rather than parsing and excuting JavaScript. As bottlenecks go, it‚Äôs not the worst.</p>
        
        <p>But even with all my core web vitals looking good, I still have an issue that can‚Äôt be solved with front-end optimisations. <a href="https://calibreapp.com/tools/core-web-vitals-test/thesession.org#ttfb">Time to first byte</a> (or TTFB if you‚Äôd rather use an initialism that takes just as long to say as the words it‚Äôs replacing).</p>
        
        <p>When it comes to <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2019/08/time-to-first-byte-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/">reducing the time to first byte</a>, there are plenty of factors that are out of my control. But in the case of The Session, something I do have control over is the server set-up, specifically the database.</p>
        
        <p>Now I could probably solve a lot of my speed issues by throwing money at the problem. If I got a bigger better server with more RAM and CPUs, I‚Äôm pretty sure it would improve the time to first byte. But my wallet wouldn‚Äôt thank me.</p>
        
        <p>(It‚Äôs still worth acknowledging that this is a perfectly valid approach when it comes to back-end optimisation that isn‚Äôt available on the front end; you can‚Äôt buy all your users new devices.)</p>
        
        <p>So I‚Äôve been spending some time really getting to grips with the MySQL database that underpins The Session. It was already normalised and indexed to the hilt. But perhaps there were server settings that could be tweaked.</p>
        
        <p>This is where I have to give a shout-out to <a href="https://releem.com/">Releem</a>, a service that is <em>exactly</em> what I needed. It monitors your database and then over time suggests configuration tweaks, explaining each one along the way. It‚Äôs a seriously good service that feels as empowering as it is useful.</p>
        
        <p>I wish I could afford to use Releem on an ongoing basis, but luckily there‚Äôs a free trial period that I could avail of.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks to Releem, I was also able to see which specific queries were taking the longest. There was one in particular that had always bothered me‚Ä¶</p>
        
        <p>If you‚Äôre a member of The Session, then you can see any activity related to something you submitted in the past. Say, for example, that you added a tune or an event to the site a while back. If someone else comments on that, or bookmarks it, then that shows up in your ‚Äúnotifications‚Äù feed.</p>
        
        <p>That‚Äôs all well and good but under the hood it was relying on a fairly convuluted database query to a very large table (a table that‚Äôs effectively a log of all user actions). I tried all sorts of query optimisations but there always seemed to be some combination of circumstances where the request would take ages.</p>
        
        <p>For a while I even removed the notifications functionality from the site, hoping it wouldn‚Äôt be missed. But a couple of people wrote to ask where it had gone so I figured I ought to reinstate it.</p>
        
        <p>After exhausting all the technical improvements, I took a step back and thought about the <em>purpose</em> of this particular feature. That‚Äôs when I realised that I had been thinking about the database query too literally.</p>
        
        <p>The results are ordered in reverse chronological order, which makes sense. They‚Äôre also chunked into groups of ten, which also makes sense. But I had allowed for the possibility that you could navigate through your notifications back to the very start of your time on the site.</p>
        
        <p>But that‚Äôs not really how we think of notifications in other settings. What would happen if I were to limit your notifications only to activity in, say, the last month?</p>
        
        <p>Boom! Instant performance improvement by orders of magnitude.</p>
        
        <p>I guess there‚Äôs a lesson there about switching off the over-analytical side of my brain and focusing on actual user needs.</p>
        
        <p>Anyway, thanks to the time I‚Äôve spent honing the database settings and optimising the longest queries, I‚Äôve reduced the latency by quite a bit. I‚Äôm hoping that will result in an improvement to the time to first byte.</p>
        
        <p>Time‚Äîand <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">monitoring tools</a>‚Äîwill tell.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Story. I'm on a mail list for Berkman, where I spent two years at Harvard. Alumnae of all generations are on this list, and it's interesting.</p>
        <p>Just got an email that someone was proud of having their picture taken with Susan Landau. I didn't know who she was, so I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Landau">looked her up</a>.</p>
        <p>She was born in 1954. And is a highly accomplished math and comp sci wizard, with cred at Harvard, Google, and now teaches at Tufts. </p>
        <p>Then I get to the place where they say she went to <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Bronx%20Science%22">Bronx Science</a>. </p>
        <p>That was my class, unless she, like I, skipped a grade. We both would have started in 1969 and graduated in 1972.</p>
        <p>I just wanted to write this up because I've noticed in the last few years, now that I live in the northeast, not far from the Bronx, I tend to come across more Science alums, and when I do, I generally find we have a lot to talk about, and share a New York style nerd sense of humor. </p>
        <p>And as a math major myself, I conclude that their test was pretty good, it definitely selected a certain kind of mind, and the people it selected generally went on to do interesting, creative and useful things. </p>]]>

Glad to finally get the whole plan down in one place. Each piece of the puzzle took a while to come together in concept and then in implementation. I'm still working on all levels, last week I added a feature to <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> that makes it fit in better with the (new) timeline and WordPress (20+ years). It takes a while to change your thinking from WordPress being just another blogging CMS, to being an open platform that hosts <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">web writing</a> in a way that's open to competition. We're on the same page. It's still a competitive environment, but there are rules to competing, you don't cash in the interop that took patience and respect to develop and maintain. That's been the pity of the open web, lots of opportunists who are willing to stink up the ecosystem to squeeze a few more bucks for themselves from things <i>they didn't create.</i> Let your competitors in, and the users, if they have their heads screwed on right, will respect you for it. And even if they don't, still do it, because it's the right thing to do. That's why, at my age, just turned 70 earlier this year, I'm in a position to help revive the web, because I've made enough money, now it's time to make sure the gift that I got from the open web is available to future generations, no matter how greedy and selfish the <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/08/29/the-wealthy-and-dominant-giants-of-tech/">giants of tech</a> are. People may question Matt, and that's cool, as I said <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a142100">yesterday</a>, but also remember he's stood up for your freedom, and that's also important.]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I just heard about <a href="https://www.fodors.com/news/news/there-are-warnings-about-the-bag-tag-scam-but-is-it-really-a-scam">this</a>:</p>
        <blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://travelnoire.com/luggage-tag-scam">travel scam warning</a> going around the internet right now: You should keep your baggage tags on your bags until you get home, then shred them, because scammers are using luggage tags to file fraudulent claims for missing baggage with the airline.</p></blockquote>
        <p>First, the scam is possible. I had a bag destroyed by baggage handlers on a recent flight, and all the information I needed to file a claim was on my luggage tag. I have no idea if I will successfully get any money from the airline, or what form it will be in, or how it will be tied to my name, but at least the first step is possible...</p>]]>

I'm going to be introducing a very weird idea about WordPress, one that's going to bend your mind a lot, especially if you're a member of the WordPress community, but also if you're a developer who has used WordPress in an application sometime in the last 20 years, or a user who has used it to keep a blog, or to run a business website, or just someone who hangs around the web. It's famous, but not in the way I'm going to present it. I'm going to ask you to see WordPress the same way you think of Mastodon or Bluesky. It's a way of storing realtime text and graphics, and arrange them by time, and read and write them, subscribe to people, comment on what others have written, communicate with other people you find on a twitter-like network. If you look at the actual sofware, you'll see that WordPress and the other two systems have very similar features. They all store messages. And arrange them chronologically and in relation to other messages and people. But WordPress does it better.</p>]]>

      <title>2025-08-28 Online safety, maybe</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-08-28-online-safety-maybe">2025-08-28 Online safety, maybe</h1>
        
        <p>The longer I provide web services to strangers, the more I feel that data is toxic. I used to think I only had to worry about spam and vandalism, but with every regulator thinking that far more terrible material is just waiting to show up, and that they need to go after the recipients instead of the perpetrators, I&rsquo;m really starting to feel it.</p>
        
        <p>DMCA and its descendants all over the world were pretty bad when it came to the anti-circumvention clauses but pretty OK when it came to a lack of moderation. And I know, moderation is good. But I also like the fact that I can host a lot of wikis without having to moderate. Luckily, it wasn&rsquo;t necessary in the last 20 years (other than spam and vandalism). It&rsquo;s getting somewhat harder to be excited by it all, though.</p>
        
        <p>For example, the Online Safety Act in the UK basically requires moderation before publication (or geo-blocking the UK).</p>
        
        <p>Another example is my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/xobaque.git/">Xobaque</a> &ldquo;search engine with no crawler&rdquo; that relies on feeds to provide the pages to index. The feeds are untrusted data provided by strangers on the Internet. Should Xobaque check that the pages actually exist? Should I check that they are on-topic and don&rsquo;t violate the law? (In what jurisdictions?) Should I verify the identities of the people that upload the feeds? The people writing the feeds?</p>
        
        <p>Or should I just stand on the balcony and water the plants, listening to the drone of planes above and constant rumbling of cars in the distance, tending my garden, as it were.</p>
        
        <p>I suspect this is the beginning of chilling effects. For a short while, tinkering at home felt the same, whether it was a little something for the household or for &ldquo;the Internet&rdquo;. As it becomes clear that private and public spheres are in fact different, something must change. The first time I realised this was during the Napster days of copyright and music. The more this happens, the more I feel that online activity basically requires a lawyer, a company (the sacrificial lamb should you stumble somewhere on the way), and all the other contraptions of corporate life. Blech!</p>

      <title>Big bird in my pool</title>
      <link>http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/133314.html?title=bigBirdInMyPool</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Last week I did an unusual podcast about three huge birds fighting over a fish in a nearby pond. Usually I write and talk about technology or politics, but this was such a compelling story and I didn't have any photos or video, so I did a verbal story. Hope you enjoyed it. Well now I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxgN2uUYAU">video</a>! </p>
        <p>On Tuesday I went out to my pool, there was one of the big birds, in the pool. He couldn't get out. The pool is fenced in, as it must be, to keep animals and children from drowning, and the fence was too tall for the bird to fly out, or so it seemed. When it spotted me, it freaked out and tried to squeeze through the fence, which was impossible, the holes in the fence were too small for his sizeable body. </p>
        <p>The bird did eventually manage to fly out, thankfully -- maybe I'll do another verbal podcast to explain why that was such an accomplishment. But for right now I just want to share the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxgN2uUYAU">video</a>.  </p>

        <![CDATA[<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/27/chefBoyardeeLasagna.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It's the future, and the great power of the X galaxy, on the planet Y of star Z, has accidentally elected a despotic prime minister who also happens to be an excellent standup comic. Kind of like Robin Williams, from the planet you come from, but he's a centipede and only breathes what you would think of as Chef Boyardee lasagna, but it's not really that, it's different. </p>
        <p>Anyway, he's old, 757 centuries give or take, and they're expecting him to die soon, and they can elect someone boring so they can forget about politics. Everyone is looking forward to the relaxation. </p>
        <p>And then one day he does die, and everyone breathes a huge sigh of relief, until later that night, on the 10-screen equivalent of what you would think of as TV, hilarity ensues when the "dead" PM showed up, looking fit, young and dashing, doing slapstick and talking about how he's going to make a mess of something. </p>
        <p>Everyone was furious and then puzzled, we thought he was dead -- until the rumor started going around that the scientists had invented a sort of "artificial" thing that could perfectly emulate anyone or anything, including a Lasagna-breathing centipede comic despot from planet Y of star Z in the X galaxy. Everyone was pissed, but mostly agreed the PM was still pretty funny.</p>
        <p>End of pilot. </p>

On the web seemed relatively easy. But of the web is a bit more elusive. Until <a href="https://x.com/KenSmith/status/1960475445457039601">Ken Smith</a> found <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html#:~:text=%22Hypertext%22%20is%20a%20term%20coined,together%20in%20an%20unconstrained%20way">this quote</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a> in the original 1989 proposal by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> for what would become the web. "Human-readable information linked together in an unconstrained way." I like this, because it, like the definition I came up with for <a href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/">weblog</a>, talks about the activity as opposed to the technology. Human-readable is essential. And most essential is "unconstrained." If something requires a link, you should link to it. If you don't it ain't the web.]]>

But inside the document, Bargury hid a 300-word malicious prompt that contains instructions for ChatGPT.

Most of C21 IT today is &ldquo;kayfabe&rdquo;: deliberately fake, to fool the audience.</p> <p><strong>SaaS:</strong> fake corporate IT services for company directors too cheap to hire competent IT staff.</p> <p>The lie: it&rsquo;s OK and safe to let other companies run your IT for you.</p> <p>The truth: if it matters, own it, run it yourself.</p> <p><strong>Public cloud:</strong> it&rsquo;s cheaper to&nbsp;leave your server  hosting up to specialists. The lie: no it isn&rsquo;t, but worse, you lose  control of core key assets. The truth: you only need this for your  public website, if that.</p> <p><strong>Kubernetes:</strong> you, yes <em>you,</em> you could be the  next viral success and you need a website that scales to 10 million  visitors a second.

You can&rsquo;t.

        <![CDATA[I think perhaps I should have one day every week where I never link to anything. Just to provide a demo of what the web would be like without linking. Which is most of the sites that say they are part of the web. I think that's a lie we should stop tolerating. Or maybe I should just stop offsite linking for one day a week. That would be interesting wouldn't it. Or I could charge extra for the version with the links. (It's very rare that I charge anything to use any of my web work, but I <i>have</i> done that at times.)]]>

        <![CDATA[I'm working my way through Mr Robot, for the third time I think. If you want to know what I do, it's like what Elliot does, for about four hours pretty much every day. I used to work longer hours but I've found this amount of work is optimal. I make more mistakes after about 1PM. Anyway Mr Robot is a very good thing to watch for the times we live in. The technology is already a little outdated, but they thought of that, there are some scenes where they use old PCs from the 80s, with total respect. I like that. And the utilities he uses are pretty much the same ones I use these days. And the context of a world in technological meltdown, I think that's a very realistic scenario. I don't see how our networks can't avoid breaking down. And our health care system, which these days is pretty much the same thing.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/newslettered/">Ethan tagged me in a post</a>. I didn‚Äôt feel a thing.</p>
        
        <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to invite a few other folks to share their favorite newsletters‚Äù, he wrote.</p>
        
        <p>My immediate thought was that I don‚Äôt actually subscribe to many newsletters. But then I remembered that most newsletters are available as RSS feeds, and I very much <em>do</em> subscribe to those.</p>
        
        <p>Reading RSS and reading email feel very different to me. A new item in my email client feels like a task. A new item in my feed reader feels like a gift.</p>
        
        <p>Anyway, I poked around in <a href="https://adactio.com/feeds/subscriptions/">my subscriptions</a> and found some newsletters in there that I can heartily recommend.</p>
        
        <p>First and foremost, there‚Äôs <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/">The History Of The Web</a> by Jay Hoffman. Each newsletter is a building block for the timeline of the web that he‚Äôs putting together. It‚Äôs very much up my alley.</p>
        
        <p>On the topic of the World Wide Web, <a href="https://matthiasott.com/">Matthias</a> has a newsletter called <a href="https://buttondown.com/ownyourweb">Own Your Web</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>Whether you want to get started with your own personal website or level up as a designer, developer, or independent creator working with the ever-changing material of the Web, this little email is for you. ‚ù§‚úä</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>On the inescapable topic of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, I can recommend <a href="https://buttondown.com/maiht3k">Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000: The Newsletter</a> by Professor Emily M. Bender and Doctor Alex Hanna.</p>
        
        <p>Journalist <a href="https://www.clivethompson.net/">Clive Thompson</a> has a fun newsletter called <a href="https://buttondown.com/clivethompson">The Linkfest</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>The opposite of doomscrolling: Every two weeks (roughly) I send you a collection of the best Internet reading I&#8217;ve found &#8212; links to culture, technology, art and science that fascinated me.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>If you like that, you‚Äôll love <a href="https://thewhippet.org/">The Whippet</a> by <a href="https://mckinleyvalentine.com/">McKinley Valentine</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>A newsletter for the terminally curious</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Okay, now there are three more newsletters that I like, but I‚Äôm hesitant to recommend for the simple reason that they‚Äôre on <a href="https://leavesubstack.com/">Substack</a> alongside a pile of racist trash. If you decide you like any of these, please don‚Äôt subscribe by email; use the RSS feed. For the love of Jeebus, don‚Äôt give Substack your email address.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/">Age of Invention</a> by Anton Howes is a deep, deep dive into the history of technology and industry:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>I‚Äôm interested in everything from the exploits of sixteenth-century alchemists to the schemes of Victorian engineers.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Finally, there are two newsletters written by people whose music I listened to in my formative years in Ireland‚Ä¶</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://paulpage.substack.com/">When We Were Young</a> by Paul Page recounts his time in the band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IutkqyUU5o">Whipping Boy</a> in the ‚Äô90s:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>This will be the story of Whipping Boy told from my perspective.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=popslMUM_mE">Toasted Heretic</a> were making very different music around the same time as Whipping Boy. Their singer <a href="https://www.juliangough.com/">Julian Gough</a> has gone on to write books, poems, and now a newsletter about cosmology called <a href="https://theeggandtherock.com/">The Egg And The Rock</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>The Egg and the Rock makes a big, specific argument (backed up by a lot of recent data, across many fields), that our universe appears to be the result of an evolutionary process at the level of universes.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>There you go‚Äîquite a grab bag of newsletter options for you.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[The <a href="https://this.how/web/what.opml#1756211321000">consensus</a> among the people who responded to my what does "on the web" mean query is this. Something is on the web if it has a URL you can use to view it in a web browser. That means, in 2025, that the URL begins with HTTP or HTTPS. Every "page" on a site must have a URL so they can be pointed to independently, otherwise known as deep linking. It's not enough to just have a home page that's on the web. So for example, an iPhone app isn't on the web just because it has an information page that is.]]>

        <blockquote><p>Three Dutch security analysts discovered the vulnerabilities¬≠&#8212;five in total&#8212;¬≠in a European radio standard called TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), which is used in radios made by Motorola, Damm, Hytera, and others. The standard has been used in radios since the ‚Äô90s, but the flaws remained unknown because encryption algorithms used in TETRA were kept secret until now. </p></blockquote>
        <p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/encryption-made-for-police-and-military-radios-may-be-easily-cracked-researchers-find/">new news</a>:</p>
        <blockquote><p>In 2023, Carlo Meijer, Wouter Bokslag, and Jos Wetzels of security firm <a href="https://www.midnightblue.nl/">Midnight Blue</a>, based in the Netherlands, discovered vulnerabilities in encryption algorithms that are part of a European radio standard created by ETSI called TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), which has been baked into radio systems made by Motorola, Damm, Sepura, and others since the ‚Äô90s. The flaws remained unknown publicly until their disclosure, because ETSI refused for decades to let anyone examine the proprietary algorithms...</p></blockquote>]]>

      <title>Trump&#39;s secret was comedy</title>
      <link>http://scripting.com/2025/08/25/212400.html?title=trumpsSecretWasComedy</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Trump is a comedian. He makes people laugh the way Joan Rivers or Don Rickles did. </p>
        <p>It's verbal slapstick, which is for some reason I don't understand immensely funny and entertaining.</p>
        <p>Newsom is making us laugh by imitating Trump imitating Joan and Don. It's working. He must keep doing it, and he should evolve the schtick, he should make Trump match <i>him. </i>And where Trump is promoting depraved policies with his comedy, we can count on Newsom to stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law and all the progress we've made. </p>
        <p>He can invite famous comedians on his podcast to play opposite him, sometimes the straight man, playing their SNL roles. So much potential. He's got the attention, don't throw it away. </p>
        <p>Politics was boring, it's not boring anymore. But there's no reason excitement and entertainment can't be good for us too! ;-)</p>
        <p>Trump's secret is comedy and Newsom is stealing his thunder</p>]]>

      <title>Successive Prototypes Bridge the Gap Between Idea and Reality</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/idea-to-reality-with-prototypes/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Dismissing an idea because it doesn‚Äôt work in your head is doing a disservice to the idea.</p>
        <p>(Same for dismissing someone else‚Äôs idea because it doesn‚Äôt work in your head.)</p>
        <p>The only way to truly know if an idea works is to test it. </p>
        <p>The gap between an idea and reality is the work. </p>
        <p>You can‚Äôt dismiss something as ‚Äúnot working‚Äù without <em>doing</em> the work.</p>
        <p>When collaborating with others, different ideas can be put forward which end up in competition with each other.</p>
        <p>We debate which is best, but verbal descriptions don‚Äôt do justice to ideas ‚Äî so the idea that wins is the one whose champion is the most persuasive (or has the most institutional authority).</p>
        <p>You don‚Äôt want that. You want an environment where ideas can be evaluated based on their substance and not on the personal attributes of the person advocating them.</p>
        <p>This is the value of prototypes. </p>
        <p>We can‚Äôt visualize or predict how our own ideas will play out, let alone other people‚Äôs. This is why it‚Äôs necessary to bring them to life, have them take concrete form. It‚Äôs the only way to do them justice.</p>
        <p>(Picture a cute puppy in your head. I‚Äôve got one too. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/the-power-of-prototypes-in-the-creative-process/" >Now how do we determine who‚Äôs imagining the cuter puppy?</a> We can‚Äôt. We have to produce a concrete manifestation for contrast and comparison.)</p>
        <p>Prototypes are how we bridge the gap between idea and reality. They‚Äôre an iterative, evolutionary, exploratory form of birthing ideas that test their substance.</p>
        <p>People will bow out to a good persuasive argument.</p>
        <p>They‚Äôll bow out to their boss saying it should be one way or another.</p>
        <p>But it‚Äôs hard to bow out to a good idea you can see, taste, touch, smell, or use. </p>

      <title>2025-08-18 Z√ºrich Zoo</title>
      <link>https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-18-zoo</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-08-18-z√ºrich-zoo">2025-08-18 Z√ºrich Zoo</h1>
        
        <p>We went to the Z√ºrich Zoo.</p>
        
        <p>We started in the Australian section where they have a bunch of wallabies.
        You can enter the enclosure. There were three wallabies chasing each other, grunting.
        We suspected it was related to intercourse but when they stopped there was just short attempt at it and then they all preferred to drink water instead.</p>
        
        <p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-necked_wallaby">red-necked wallaby</a>, <em>Notamacropus rufogriseus</em>.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-7.jpg" alt="A wallaby eating salad. The pink pouch is very visible." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-8.jpg" alt="Wallaby head with backlight, showing the long whiskers." /></p>
        
        <p>The same enclosure also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu">emus</a>, <em>Dromaius novaehollandiae</em>.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-9.jpg" alt="An emu head with backlight, showing the delicate feathers around its face." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-10.jpg" alt="A super fluffy young (?) emu head." /></p>
        
        <p>We went on to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanaco">guanaco</a>, <em>Lama guanicoe</em>.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-11.jpg" alt="A wet guanaco who&rsquo;s been standing in a water spray to cool down." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-12.jpg" alt="A super cute young guanaco with huge black eyes." /></p>
        
        <p>Next we saw some strange birds with strange, featherless heads. It&rsquo;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_bald_ibis">northern bald ibis</a>, <em>Geronticus eremita</em>. These used to be extinct in Switzerland but now they&rsquo;re back. They migrate south and so for rewilding, people had to adopt them and then fly with them across the alps with some ultralight flying vehicles. These days they fly to southern Spain instead, I heard. You can find some pictures about the project <a href="https://www.srf.ch/wissen/natur-tiere/rueckkehr-des-waldrapps-die-kueken-sind-da-das-comeback-eines-schraegen-vogels">on the Swiss radio and television site</a>.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-13.jpg" alt="A bird with black feathers and a bald red head with patches of grey, with orange eyes and a typical long, bent ibis beak" /></p>
        
        <p>We went to see the great cats because the zoo has a new setup wherein the tigers, lions and snow leopards move between enclosures every now and then. This keeps them more active because they smell the presence of the other great cats that were here before them. But as usual, the cats were asleep during the day.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-14.jpg" alt="A lioness&rsquo; paw. It big!" /></p>
        
        <p>There&rsquo;s also an &ldquo;insect forest&rdquo; where you can step into a room with a bunch of branches full of stick insects and the like.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-15.jpg" alt="A green, leaf-like insect with plenty of thorns. This is the Heteropteryx dilatata." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-16.jpg" alt="Sadly, I was unable to find anything about this insect on the zoo site. It&rsquo;s very large, green, and its wings look like leaves that it keeps close to the body." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-17.jpg" alt="A big beetle seen from below. This is Mecynorhina ugandensis." /></p>
        
        <p>When we went to eat a snack at the <em>Altes Kl√∂sterli</em> restaurant, we had a view at the back of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelada">gelada</a> enclosure, <em>Theropithecus gelada</em>.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-18.jpg" alt="A female monkey sitting in front of a male. She has a bright red patch of hairless skin on her breast looking like a very strange, red necklace." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-19.jpg" alt="The male monkey has superb hairstyle, a bit like David Bowie in The Labyrinth." /></p>
        
        <p>The elephants are great. There&rsquo;s a young one with its mother and its aunt, all Asian elephants, <em>Elephas maximus</em>.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-20.jpg" alt="A tiny elephant between two huge adults." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-21.jpg" alt="The two sisters seem to like each other, pressing their faces against each other, while the little kid disappears behind them." /></p>
        
        <p>The rhinos are nearby. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_white_rhinoceros">southern white rhinoceroses</a>, <em>Ceratotherium simum simum</em>. Closing time was approaching and these were the first rhinos to come back into their enclosure from the outside, where they mingle with some antelopes and giraffes.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-22.jpg" alt="The first rhino is looking into the enclosure and seeing humans on the other side, so it stops and tries to evaluate the situation." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-23.jpg" alt="The head of a rhinoceros with a very, very large horn." /></p>
        
        <p>Outside, more rhinos, antelopes, ostriches and giraffes were still out and about.</p>
        
        <p>These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_giraffe">reticulated giraffes</a>, <em>Giraffa reticulata</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_ostrich">South African ostriches</a>, <em>Struthio camelus australis</em>.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-24.jpg" alt="The heads of two giraffes with their huge black eyes " />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-25.jpg" alt="The head of an ostrich with its grey feathers." /></p>
        
        <p>Nearby, the super cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat">meerkat</a>, <em>Suricata suricatta</em>. One of them is always on the lookout.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-26.jpg" alt="The lookout is standing upright and looking at the horizon and the sky, not at the people." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-27.jpg" alt="A meerkat baby!" /></p>
        
        <p>And finally, on the way out, we walked through the Masoala hall. So beautiful!</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-4.jpg" alt="The Masoala hall, from one of the two towers. A green jungle below." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-6.jpg" alt="A picture showing the walkway above the tree canopy connecting the two towers, with me standing there in the greenery." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-5.jpg" alt="A passion flower growing on a handrail." /></p>
        
        <p>The greatest moment was when we approached the bottom of one of the two towers. I walked around the corner and was looking at two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_ruffed_lemur">red ruffed lemurs</a>, <em>Varecia rubra</em>.</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-3.jpg" alt="Two super cute lemurs with bright yellow eyes, black heads, red fur and black paws that look more like hands, and a long tail held up like a question-mark." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-1.jpg" alt="The lemurs climbed up a stone wall and walked around me." />
        <img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-2.jpg" alt="The lemurs disappear into the jungle." /></p>
        
        <p>And then, we left!</p>
        
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-28.jpg" alt="A very bright green gecko, Phelsuma grandis" /></p>

        <![CDATA[I've been following Mark Cuban's recent posts on Bluesky, coming up with constructive things successful entrepreneurs can do to help. I had a different idea. Apply for a fellowship at a university, away from where you live, maybe in a place you've always wanted to try. In your application say you bring your entrepreneurial experience, but you're leaving your money on the side. You're coming to the university with the idea of creating something collaboratively, bringing the entrepreneurial approach of startups to the mix of people you find among academics. You're there to learn from the teachers and the students, and help them understand what you do. Use your mind, experience, creativity, even your contacts, but leave the money at home. You can live in a nice house, drive a nice car, but eat in the places people in the university eat, go to the lectures, concerts, sporting events, in other words, go back to school with your new perspective, and make a <i>personal</i> contribution. It's much more satisfying than spending money is, I speak from experience. There's a different kind of success in the collaboration. Another way to test yourself and develop new perspectives and experience. I wrote about this a few years back in <a href="https://this.how/phoenix/">Developing Better Developers</a>.]]>

        <![CDATA[I've been exchanging emails and voicemails with <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/dpknauss/">Dan Knauss</a>, a longtime WordPress developer and one of the hosts of WordCamp Canada which I am speaking at in October. Learning a lot about the community and culture. I wonder, have I ever been part of a community that's over 20 years old? I can't think of one off the top of my head. I have gotten this far without knowing much about the WordPress community, other than what I've heard via Matt and what I've been able to infer from that. I've known Matt since he was a teenage boy wonder in the tech industry working at CNET and then as an entrepreneur. I think my point of view is a new one, I don't bring much baggage with me. I am generally sympathetic with Matt, having been the leader of the blogging world when it started, and found it a pretty thankless place, a position I was happy to relinquish in 2003 when I went to academia.]]>

I actually liked that the docs were old and kind of dusty. It says that the engineering culture is to not mess around with things that developers have already built on.

      <title>2025-08-21 Looking at web server logs</title>
      <link>https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-21-web-server-logs</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-08-21-looking-at-web-server-logs">2025-08-21 Looking at web server logs</h1>
        
        <p><a class="account" href="https://scholar.social/@bookandswordblog" title="@bookandswordblog@scholar.social">@bookandswordblog</a> recently wondered how to look at web server logs. Ever since I&rsquo;m fighting the bots, I&rsquo;ve had to look at the web server stats and my <a href="/admin">admin</a> folder is full of small scripts. But if you&rsquo;re new to it all, how do you start?</p>
        
        <h2 id="where-are-the-files">Where are the files?</h2>
        
        <p>If you use Apache on Debian, the current log file is in <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code> so look for something similar. If you use nginx instead of Apache, it might be a folder like <code>/var/log/nginx</code>. The log file itself might be called differently, too.</p>
        
        <h2 id="log-format">Log format</h2>
        
        <p>The log file format can vary, too. If you use Apache on Debian, the log formats are set in <code>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</code> using the <code>LogFormat</code> directive, and each virtual host can pick one of them using the <code>CustomLog</code> directive.
        See <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#accesslog">Log Files</a>.</p>
        
        <p>In my case, I use a config file that sets the following:</p>
        
        <pre><code>LogFormat &quot;%v:%p %h %l %u %t \&quot;%r\&quot; %&gt;s %O \&quot;%{Referer}i\&quot; \&quot;%{User-Agent}i\&quot; %&gt;D&quot; vhost_combined
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log vhost_combined
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>This adds <code>%&gt;D</code> at the end of the format and is otherwise identical to the default <code>vhost_combined</code> format.
        The format codes are documented on the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats">mod_log_config</a> page.</p>
        
        <p>And example line from my logs:</p>
        
        <p><code>social.alexschroeder.ch:443 37.27.248.47 - - [21/Aug/2025:00:59:49 +0200] &quot;POST /users/alex/inbox HTTP/1.1&quot; 202 4207 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mastodon/4.4.2 (http.rb/5.3.1; +https://beige.party/)&quot; 33180</code></p>
        
        <p>This means:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>a request to host <code>social.alexschroeder.ch</code> on port <code>443</code></li>
        <li>from IP address <code>37.27.248.47</code></li>
        <li>with no remote log name</li>
        <li>and no remote user</li>
        <li>on 2025-08-21 00:59:49 CEST</li>
        <li>posted information to <code>/users/alex/inbox</code> (to read information the request would have used <code>GET</code> instead of <code>POST</code>)</li>
        <li>the response was a status 202 (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status">HTTP response status codes</a> for a list)</li>
        <li>and contained 4207 bytes</li>
        <li>with no referrer provided</li>
        <li>from a Mastodon user agent self-identifying as from beige.party</li>
        <li>taking 33180 microseconds, or about 33 milliseconds (this is the information I added)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="processing-the-log-using-awk">Processing the log using <code>awk</code></h2>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;m going to use <code>awk</code> to process the log files. It&rsquo;s a very old programming language.</p>
        
        <p>Every line is split into words based on spaces. Each word is numbered and available as a variable starting with the dollar sign and its number. Therefore, when processing the <code>access.log</code> file using the format shown above, the number variables contain the following:</p>
        
        <pre><code> $1  social.alexschroeder.ch:443
         $2  37.27.248.47
         $3  -
         $4  -
         $5  [21/Aug/2025:00:59:49
         $6  +0200]
         $7  &quot;POST
         $8  /users/alex/inbox
         $9  HTTP/1.1&quot;
        $10  202
        $11  4207
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>You&rsquo;ll note that those square brackets and double quotes are sometimes very annoying. ü§®</p>
        
        <p>A block is enclosed in braces <code>{ like this }</code> and is executed for every line. You don&rsquo;t need to declare variables before assigning to them. An element of a an associative array (a hash map in Perl or Java, a Dictionary in Python) is accessed using square brackets <code>like[this]</code>.</p>
        
        <p>A block after <code>END</code> is executed just once, at the end of the input.</p>
        
        <h2 id="counting-the-hits-per-ip-number">Counting the hits per IP number</h2>
        
        <p>We use an associative array where the key is the IP address of the visitor and the value is the number of hits. At the end, we print the number hits, a tab, and the IP address, for every address. The <code>++</code> operator increments the operand by one. <code>$2</code> is the IP address, and <code>hits</code> is the associative array.</p>
        
        <p>We then use <code>sort --sort-numerically --reverse</code> to sort these lines by their hits, putting more hits at the top. <code>head --lines=20</code> then prints the first 20 lines.</p>
        
        <pre><code>awk '{hits[$2]++} END {for (ip in hits) printf &quot;%d\t%s\n&quot;, hits[ip], ip}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
        | sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
        | head --lines=20
        </code></pre>
        
        <h2 id="counting-the-bytes-per-ip-number-the-bandwidth-used">Counting the bytes per IP number (the bandwidth used)</h2>
        
        <p>In order to sum the bandwidth used, we need to sum the bytes send per IP number.
        The <code>awk</code> script here does that and prints the number of MB (1000000 bytes) per IP number.</p>
        
        <p>We then use <code>sort --sort-numerically --reverse</code> to sort these lines by their hits, putting more volume at the top. <code>head --lines=20</code> then prints the first 20 lines.</p>
        
        <pre><code>awk '{vol[$2] += $11} END {for (ip in vol) printf &quot;%dM\t%s\n&quot;, vol[ip]/1E6, ip}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
        | sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
        | head --lines=20
        </code></pre>
        
        <h2 id="ranking-the-requests-by-popularity">Ranking the requests by popularity</h2>
        
        <p>In order to rank the requests we need to print the requests and count them, then sort them.
        The <code>awk</code> script just prints the request itself; <code>sort</code> sorts the lines and <code>uniq -c</code> counts the unique lines (it requires a sorted input)</p>
        
        <p>We then use <code>sort --sort-numerically --reverse</code> to sort these lines, putting more hits at the top. <code>head --lines=20</code> then prints the first 20 lines.</p>
        
        <pre><code>awk '{print $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
        | sort \
        | uniq --count \
        | sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
        | head --lines=20
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Sometimes it can be interesting to note what sort requests are not OK (Status 200). Instead of starting with the whole access log, we only print requests if the status is not 200.
        This uses a new feature of <code>awk</code> that we haven&rsquo;t used before. You can have conditions before the block.</p>
        
        <pre><code>awk '$10 != 200 {print $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
        | sort \
        | uniq --count \
        | sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
        | head --lines=20
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in the status itself:</p>
        
        <pre><code>awk '$10 != 200 {print $10, $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
        | sort \
        | uniq --count \
        | sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
        | head --lines=20
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Or if you&rsquo;re interested only in errors for one particular virtual host:</p>
        
        <pre><code>awk '$1 == &quot;alexschroeder.ch:443&quot; &amp;&amp; $10 &gt;= 400 {print $10, $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
        | sort \
        | uniq --count \

      <title>2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</title>
      <link>https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-15-xobaque</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-08-15-an-opt-in-search-engine-xobaque">2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</h1>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been writing a search engine that doesn&rsquo;t crawl the web.
        I called it <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/xobaque.git/">Xobaque</a>.</p>
        
        <p>On <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2025-08-22">2025-08-22</a> I set it up to <a href="https://search.emacslife.com/">search Planet Emacslife</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Xobaque is entirely opt-in and push based: web admins have total control over what they want to have indexed. The drawback is that web admins have to upload their pages!</p>
        
        <p>I foresee this to be a solution for sites that don&rsquo;t have good local search, like <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/">Emacs Wiki</a>, or communities, like all the blogs on <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>. If we want to rely less on big search engines, we have to provide our own.</p>
        
        <p>Technically, Xobaque is writen on top of the <a href="https://sqlite.org/fts5.html#sorting_by_auxiliary_function_results">SQLite FTS5 Extension</a>. This extension does all the heavy lifting: indexing, searching, ranking, highlighting, snippets, boolean operators. Boolean operators! Do you remember those? Good times. The extension is quite amazing, really.</p>
        
        <p>What Xobaque provides is the command-line interface and the web interface. Right now, the command-line interface has a command to initialize an empty database and a command to upload a single page.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some examples of how to use this in a script.</p>
        
        <p>My homepage:</p>
        
        <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
        cd /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki
        for line in (/home/oddmu/oddmu list)
          set --local info (string split &quot;	&quot; $line)
          set --local name (string replace --regex '^/home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/' '' $info[1] | string replace --regex '.md' '')
          set --local title $info[2]
          /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
            -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
            -base &quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/&quot; \
            -local &quot;$name&quot; \
            -title &quot;$title&quot; \
            -filename &quot;$name.md&quot;
        end
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Emacs Wiki:</p>
        
        <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
        for path in (grep --files-without-match '^#FILE ' /home/alex/emacswiki/git/* /home/alex/emacswiki/git/.*)
          set --local name (string replace '/home/alex/emacswiki/git/' '' $path)
          set --local title (string replace '_' ' ' $name)
          /home/xobaque/xobaque upload \
            -db &quot;/home/xobaque/index.db&quot; \
            -base &quot;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/&quot; \
            -local &quot;$name&quot; \
            -title &quot;$title&quot; \
            -filename &quot;/home/alex/emacswiki/git/$name&quot;
        end
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>The alternative to uploading via the command-line, I think, will be feed ingestion. Web site owners can send their feeds to Xobaque and it will index the entries in the feed. If the entries have the full text, that&rsquo;s great. If they have an excerpt, that works, too. You opt-in with whatever you provide.</p>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;m assuming that this will be a system for friends only, so the upload will be protected by a login. Otherwise, people will be able to upload other people&rsquo;s sites and that violates the opt-in idea.</p>
        
        <p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Xobaque">#Xobaque</a></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-15</strong>. I have that vague idea that it would process OPML files like the <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/opml.xml">Planet Emacslife OPML</a> or the three RPG Planet OPML files, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/indie.opml">Indie</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/osr.opml">OSR</a> and <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/other.opml">Other</a>. From the OPML files Xobaque would know a bunch of feeds which it could then use for updates. I have written <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/planet-jupiter.git/">Planet Jupiter</a>, so I know that from 80% to 90% is handling blogs that are down and from 90% to 100% it&rsquo;s all about fiddling with the markup‚Ä¶ There&rsquo;s also the question of consent. So perhaps one would have to start a new list of feeds for those people who explicitly consent. And if by chance that covers all the feeds on Planet Emacslife or RPG Planet that&rsquo;d be a reason to laugh and party! üéâ</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-17</strong>. Adding feeds and collections of feeds (via OPML files) works, now. üéâ</p>
        
        <p>The feed import from the net should use ETags and If-Modified-Since headers if possible, but the convenience functions of bot the feed and the OPML library don‚Äôt provide this, so I‚Äôll have to roll my own. And then think of parallelising the requests. Go channels ahoy! üò¨</p>
        
        <p>And then a web UI for uploads and accounts? ü•∫</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-19</strong>. Xobaque now knows how to skip feeds that haven‚Äôt updated using <code>If-Modified-Since</code> and <code>If-None-Match</code> headers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-19</strong>. The errors I&rsquo;m finding in the feeds of Planet Emacslife OPML:</p>
        
        <pre><code>Error importing feed https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss: XML syntax error on line 1: illegal character code U+FFFF
        Error importing feed https://blog.laurentcharignon.com/index.xml: XML syntax error on line 231: illegal character code U+0008

        </code></pre>
        
        <p>But I guess I have 248/253 feeds imported.</p>
        
        <p>Other issues I have noticed: Endless repeats of news items that overwrite each other, only differing in title and description, and no GUID set:</p>
        
        <pre><code> Update http://tromey.com/elpa/news.html
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Then again, the items all have dates set from 2007 to 2010, so perhaps that&rsquo;s OK.</p>
        
        <p>And now I find:</p>
        
        <pre><code># ./xobaque search alex schroeder
        Emacs: Take Two
        https://takeonrules.com/2025/06/10/emacs-take-two/emacs-take-two
        extend &lt;span&gt;Emacs&lt;/span&gt;
        .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Third, learning of Alex Schroeder, both involved in &lt;abbr title=&quot;Role Playing Games&quot;&gt;RPGs
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>It works! And I really need to strip HTML, here! üòÇ</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[I picked up my Android phone to record a voice memo. I had to dismiss a dialog that said the phone had updated overnight and asked if I wanted to see a list of changes. I thought, clicked No because I had an idea I wanted to record. Opened the voice app, hit record, couldn't remember the idea. Wanted to kill the message, but the UI had changed, so the Delete button that was there before wasn't there now. Great so now I have a 4-second recording in the queue that's nothing but frustration. There ought to be some basic rules of how software evolves. You can't take away a very basic function like this. And find a way not to get in the way of the user getting done what they use your product for. One of the most basic things is recording an idea. If you're lucky enough to be the app the user uses for that, don't screw with it. Same for listening to podcasts, and a few other things. That's about all I do with my phone.]]>

Also half devils with their bat wings and stone skin, and thinking themselves to be perfect because they don&rsquo;t have any wants. And also nothing to do but stare down on us. Brrr!</p>

      <title>TrueNAS on Arm is finally a thing</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">TrueNAS on Arm is finally a thing</span>
        
                    <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few years ago, I admit it was rare to find someone running Arm hardware more powerful than a Raspberry Pi in a homelab (or more serious) setting, outside of cloud providers running Ampere or custom Arm CPUs.</p>
        
        <p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>
        
        <p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>
        
        <p>Even for storage.</p></div>

        <![CDATA[Among the many things that boomers did, for better or worse, is be a generation. Prior to that, the concept appears not to exist -- they had ages and eras. The gilded age, the roaring twenties. It wasn't about the people, it's about what was hot. If you look at it that way, there were lots of things the boomers were. We were anti-war. We turned on, tuned in and dropped out. Free sex and drugs. Rock and roll. And then we got to work. The PC era, the dotcom boom, social media. 2008, billionaires in DC, etc. Some realllly awful people are/were boomers. But we're still here to write our epitaph. The leading edge is dying at a fast clip now. It won't be long before the idea of a boomer is the stuff of legend. I really hope that Robert Reich's bullshit view of this doesn't be the conventional wisdom. Oh they were fucked up and did all this bad shit to us. Fuck you. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/210838-if-you-don-t-like-the-news-go-out-and-make">Make your own world</a>. That would be a boomer thing too, btw. The world we got, btw, was totally fucked. Someday I'll tell you that story. ;-)]]>

All this is in response to the idiotic idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Reich">little dude</a> who just wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROBERT-B-REICH-Americas-Economic/dp/B0FMD7876H/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3MQJJTEFB8PSZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g4ibja9uP1kYYBF13ImLxx8MrFyKHvaA93LcJoYIT7xNW6RN-z_DzNHG864S0EKhXt5HmX2gFZ21sUs0BOln_ubIAOz0oYcY4A0SuNo4sgIJHvRMyhjRvD7d6HXpVHHFsmcxEA17eVNjTkQYg7ocLP67CQAzzQgpiFX7AZj9f_4-XSBjmmEStej9FdNNofvuTS2zGUWwdMsSNYK4-EM1DgoLk9zGsxUImXuB17EzyHM.iOUwwGt2pQ_ndfxmAXm1yyJnXSrSIgwoHpY-3Cum40U&dib_tag=se&keywords=coming+up+short&qid=1755875758&sprefix=coming+up+short%2Caps%2C122&sr=8-2">book</a>, nine years older than me, what a putz. He apologizes for boomers, feeding the bullshit idea that somehow we are a unitary thing. A lot of boomers voted for Trump. The boomers I come from liked the Grateful Dead and yes I know some deadheads voted for Trump, so there you go, more evidence that it's all bullshit. The thing we had in common is that we were children at roughly the same times, but even that's bullshit, a 20-year old boomer in 1965 could be the <i>parent</i> of a boomer, literally a different generation, fwiw.]]>

This is fairly technical stuff, but important. I've come to see WordPress as an integral part of the web. Making the connection between a feed and the info needed to edit an item is a big usability feature. Next up, adding the equivalent feature at the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql">FeedLand level</a> (reallySimple is how it does its feed reading). Remember, this is the feed-o-verse, it's all feeds, top to bottom. Posts in some feeds can be edited. :-)]]>

      <title>Limiting YouTube to a Single Tab</title>
      <link>https://daverupert.com/2025/08/limiting-youtube-to-a-single-tab/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This week I decided to go nuclear on my bad YouTube habit. I installed a plugin called <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-limiter/ahifadmfdpgnjkchbmoafedinacdfomc">Tab Limiter</a> that lets me limit <code>youtube.com</code> to one tab at a time. Clicking links that open in new tabs will now auto-close the tab.</p>
        <p>Why do this? I talked about it before but <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/06/productivity-traps/">when I‚Äôm bored I open tabs</a>. Adding friction here prevents me from CMD+clicking videos during moments of boredom and creating a month‚Äôs-worth unclose-able tabs of videos to watch. It encourages me to stay focused and nudges me towards YouTube‚Äôs lossy<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> ‚ÄúAdd to queue‚Äù feature to queue up one video at a time in a single tab. I sort of prefer this way of using YouTube and it makes it feel a lot more like a native app.</p>
        <p>That inspired me to install the YouTube Progressive Web App and because the PWA is basically a dedicated tab, Tab Limiter keeps me from opening other videos in new tabs. I‚Äôm now funneled into the application.</p>
        <p>Opening a dropdown and clicking ‚ÄúAdd to queue‚Äù is adding more ‚Äúgood friction‚Äù to the process. It also comes with a counter. 20 tabs open, no big deal, I‚Äôm immune to that effect. 20 items in a queue. Yeesh. That‚Äôs a todo list.</p>
        <browser-window shadow>
        <img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/tablimiter.jpg" width="1200" height="800" alt="Screenshot of the tablimiter UI, it has unstyled for fields for URL and a tab limit quantity">
        </browser-window>
        <p>Tab Limiter has a brutalist UI and that‚Äôs what makes it perfect. It‚Äôs also open sourced on GitHub which is important to me so I can make sure it‚Äôs not sending my browsing history to China. And I can fork it. One improvement I‚Äôm considering is to add the closed video‚Äôs ID to the YouTube queue before closing the tab. It seems easy enough, but probably not as easy as I‚Äôm hoping. The core idea there is that it might be helpful if I come across an urgent watch-now link or someone sends me a link.</p>
        <p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/01/raycast-focus/">I‚Äôm also still using Raycast Focus</a> which is a great way to blockout time and stop distractions at the source.</p>
        <script src="https://esm.sh/@zachleat/browser-window@1.0.12" type="module"></script>
        <section class="footnotes">
        <ol>
        <li id="fn1">
        <p>YouTube queues only exist in memory in the tab context, it‚Äôs not a cross-tab feature so if you close a tab and started a new one, the entire old queue got erased forever. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></p>

      <title>2025-08-21 Initramfs</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-08-21-initramfs">2025-08-21 Initramfs</h1>
        
        <p>I just had a little system administration nightmare. It all started yesterday when I decided that I wasn&rsquo;t going to move the MNT Pocket Reform to Debian stable (Trixie) after all. I had changed the apt sources a while ago, pointing them at Trixie and yesterday I had them point back at unstable.</p>
        
        <p>This is what I had:</p>
        
        <pre><code>&gt; cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources
        # Modernized from /etc/apt/sources.list
        Types: deb
        URIs: http://deb.debian.org/debian/
        Suites: unstable
        Components: main contrib non-free
        Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>And of course:</p>
        
        <pre><code>&gt; cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mntre.sources 
        Types: deb
        URIs: https://mntre.com/reform-debian-repo
        Suites: reform
        Components: main
        Architectures: arm64
        Trusted: yes
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Then I did and <code>sudo apt update</code> and somewhere after that my problems started.
        There was a critical bug in <code>systemd</code> so held it using <code>sudo apt-mark hold systemd</code>.
        I tried <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> and I guess something didn&rsquo;t work (something about Linux kernels?) and there was something about uninstalling <code>udev</code>. The history shows I did <code>sudo apt install udev</code> to recover and that there was a <code>systemd</code> circular dependency because I did <code>sudo apt-mark unhold systemd</code>, then <code>sudo apt --fix-broken install</code> and <code>sudo apt full-upgrade</code>.</p>
        
        <p>All good? Maybe not.</p>
        
        <p>Today I tried to boot and got dropped into <code>busybox</code> on the <code>initramfs</code>. It said it couldn&rsquo;t determine the type of the root device. And indeed, <code>ls /root</code> showed nothing.</p>
        
        <p>After a lot of struggling, I finally determined that I had to mount one of the devices from <code>/dev</code> as <code>/root</code>. After some trial and error I found that the magical incantation was <code>mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk2p2 /root</code>.</p>
        
        <p>Now what?</p>
        
        <p>What appeared to help is <code>chroot /root</code> to switch to the new system. I got a real shell! I&rsquo;m a bit unclear on the details. But now I think I ran <code>update-initramfs -u</code> and then did <code>exit</code> twice. And booted successfully!</p>
        
        <p>What a nightmare.</p>
        
        <p>The first thing is to write this up, then to update the system and then to reboot. Let&rsquo;s see how this ends. Wish me luck.</p>
        
        <p>And ‚Ä¶ it&rsquo;s still broken in the same way. I can get it to boot but something is still very wrong.</p>
        
        <p>Whatever it was, it seems that installing <code>reform-desktop-minimal</code> fixed it. It looked like I got a new kernel? I have no idea. (<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/initramfs-problem-solved/3724/3">More info on the community forum</a>.)</p>
        
        <p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-21</strong>. Josch noted:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>You only mounted your root file system but you did not mount <code>/boot</code> into it. So the initramfs you created here will be stored in the <code>/boot</code> directory of your root file system but it will not be stored in the filesystem which then gets mounted as <code>/boot</code>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Makes sense!</p>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;m not sure why update-initramfs after I had booted didn&rsquo;t work, though. Perhaps I still needed the correct kernel for all of this to work? I have no idea and no way to investigate.</p>]]>

        <p>Marion and I have <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-sovereign-individual-and-the-paradox-of-the-digital-age">an essay in Aeon</a> today:</p>
        
        
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>What is happening here is more than an abstract flow of information. It is more than a means of surveillance. It is more than a price mechanism. Rather, it‚Äôs as if the air traffic control and insurance commission functions of the IBM 650 have been fused, shrunk, and wholly generalised. This is the real computing revolution. Much of what we do is immediately authenticated as we do it, stored as data, classified or scored on some sort of scale, and deployed in real time to modulate some outcome of interest ‚Äì usually, the behaviour of a person, or a machine, or an organisation. &hellip; Because of this transformation, our sense of who we are is assembled in a strange and tangled fashion. The machinery of ordinalisation attends carefully to individuals rather than coarse classes or groups. By doing so, it appears to liberate people from the constraints of social affiliations and to judge them for their distinctive qualities and contributions. It promises incorporation for the excluded, recognition for the creative, and just rewards for the entrepreneurial. And yet this emancipatory promise is delivered through systems that classify, sort and, above all, rank people with ever-greater precision and on a previously unimaginable scale. The resulting social order is a sort of paradox, characterised by constant tensions between personal freedom and social control, between the subjective elan of inner authenticity and the objective forces of external authentication. It gives rise to a certain way of being, a new kind of self, whose experiences are defined by the push for personal autonomy and the pull of platform dependency.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><p>The auction, which will include other items related to cryptology, will be held Nov. 20. RR Auction, the company arranging the sale, estimates a winning bid between $300,000 and $500,000.</p>
        <p>Along with the original handwritten plain text of K4 and other papers related to the coding, Mr. Sanborn will also be providing a 12-by-18-inch copper plate that has three lines of alphabetic characters cut through with a jigsaw, which he calls &#8220;my proof-of-concept piece&#8221; and which he kept on a table for inspiration during the two years he and helpers hand-cut the letters for the project. The process was grueling, exacting and nerve wracking. &#8220;You could not make any mistake with 1,800 letters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It could not be repaired.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]>

      <link>http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html?title=whatPodcastingIs</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><i>Note: Posted on Facebook eleven years ago. Still relevant today.</i></p>
        <p>You couldn't have had podcasting without a lot of things coming together. They all had to be there.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Networks of writers who shared links. Blogging.</li>
        <li>A protocol for moving links around a network. HTTP.</li>
        <li>Something to attach links and recordings to. RSS.</li>
        <li>A standard format for recording. MP3.</li>
        <li>Inexpensive, easy to use playback devices, that could hook up to all this. iPod.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You might argue that we still haven't gotten all the pieces needed for it to really work. But one thing is for sure, none of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. </p>
        <p>Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.</p>
        <p>Postscript: The EFF filed suit against the patent troll, but didn't listen to what I said here, which is really fucked up because they didn't create podcasting, I did. There's a tremendous lack of respect for generosity in tech, yet without generosity there's no interop, only silos. Either you made billions from something, or you don't exist. That's why I stopped supporting EFF long ago, even though I gave them what was to me a significant amount of money when they started up, and why they get involved in so many wrong-headed ideas.  They don't respect tech, they respect money.</p>

        <![CDATA[<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Jellyfin on macOS for a quick self-hosted media library</span>
        
                    <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I forgot to bring my portable Pi media server running Jellyfin on a family trip, but had a small selection of my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/how-i-rip-dvds-and-blu-rays-my-mac-2022-edition">ripped movie and TV show library</a> on my portable SSD.</p>
        
        <p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>
        
        <p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

      <title>Consistent Navigation Across My Inconsistent Websites, Part II</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/consistent-nav-across-inconsistent-sites-pt-ii/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I refreshed the little thing that let‚Äôs you <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/consistent-nav-across-inconsistent-sites/" >navigate consistently between my inconsistent subdomains</a> (<a href="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-video.mp4" >video recording</a>).</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-animation.gif" width="305" height="245" alt="Animated gif of a dynamic-island like control that expands smoothly up when clicked to reveal additional selection options." />
        
        </p><p>Here‚Äôs the tl;dr on the update:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I had to remove some features on each site to make this feel right.<ul>
        <li>Takeaway: adding stuff is easy, removing stuff is hard.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The element is a web component and not even under source control (ü§´). I serve it directly from <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/netlify-public-folder-part-i-what/" >my cdn</a>. If I want to make an update, I tweak the file on disk and <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/deploying-with-netlify-shortcuts/" >re-deploy</a>.<ul>
        <li>Takeaway: cowboy codin‚Äô, yee-haw! Live free and die hard.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>So. Many. Iterations. All of which led to what? A small, iterative evolution. <ul>
        <li>Takeaway: it‚Äôs ok for design explorations to culminate in updates that look more like an evolution than a mutation.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Want more info on the behind-the-scenes work? Read on!</p>
        <h2 id="design-explorations">Design Explorations</h2>
        <p>It might look like a simple iteration on what I previously had, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt explore the universe of possibilities first before coming back to the current iteration.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-explorations.png" width="976" height="834" alt="Screenshot of a Figma canvas with lots of artboards too small to see but denoting a lot of iterations." />
        
        </p><h3 id="v0-tabs">v0: Tabs!</h3>
        <p>A tab-like experience seemed the most natural, but how to represent it? I tried a few different ideas. On top. On bottom. Different visual styles, etc.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v0.png" width="922" height="668" alt="3 mobile-sized UI mockups of a blog post with different navigation bars." />
        
        </p><p>And of course, gotta explore how that plays out on desktop too.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v0-desktop.png" width="2363" height="752" alt="Three desktop-sized UI mockups of a blog post with different navigation bars." />
        
        </p><p>Some I liked, some I didn‚Äôt. As much as I wanted to play with going to the edges of the viewport, I realized that every browser is different and you won&#39;t be able to get a consistent ‚Äúbleed-like‚Äù visual experience across browsers. For example, if you try to make tabs that bleed to the edges, it looks nice in a frame in Figma, and even in some browsers. But it won‚Äôt look right in all browser, like iOS Safari.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v0-tabs.png" width="1348" height="550" alt="Mobile UI mockups showing a folder-style segmented tab control. One is in the frame of an iPhone where the control bleeds up into the restricted space where the dynamic island lives as well as down into the website. Whereas the other mockup is in a frame in Figma, so the highlighted tab only bleeds down into the website." />
        
        </p><p>So I couldn‚Äôt reliably leverage the idea of a bounded canvas as a design element ‚Äî which, I should‚Äôve known, has always been the case with the web.</p>
        <h3 id="v1-bottom-tabs-with-a-site-theme">v1: Bottom Tabs With a Site Theme</h3>
        <p>I really like this pattern on mobile devices, so I thought maybe I‚Äôd consider it for navigating between my sites.</p>
        <p>But how to theme across differently-styled sites? The favicon styles seemed like a good bet!</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v1.png" width="939" height="682" alt="Mobile-sized mocksups with a bottom tab bar whose active highlight color changes with the active color of each subdomain." />
        
        </p><p>And, of course, what do to on larger devices? Just stacking it felt like overkill, so I explored moving it to the edge.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v1-desktop.png" width="1591" height="758" alt="Desktop-sized mocks with tab controls on the far left of the page and the active site is higlighted according to the site's active theme color." />
        
        </p><p>I actually prototyped this in code, but I didn‚Äôt like how it felt so I scratched the idea and went other directions.</p>
        <h2 id="v2-the-unification">v2: The Unification</h2>
        <p>The more I explored what to do with this element, the more it started taking on additional responsibility.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúWhat if I unified its position <em>with</em> site-specific navigation?‚Äù I thought.</p>
        <p>This led to design explorations where the disparate subdomains began to take on not just a unified navigational element, but a unified header.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v2-1.png" width="899" height="645" alt="Mobile-sized UI mocks for Home, Blog, and Notes on jim-nielsen.com" />
        
        </p><p>And I made small, stylistic explorations with the tabs themselves too.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v2-2.png" width="885" height="645" alt="Mobile-sized UI mocks for Home, Blog, and Notes on jim-nielsen.com" />
        
        </p><p>You can see how I played toyed with the idea of a consistent header across all my sites (not an intended goal, but ya know, scope creep gets us all).</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v2-3.png" width="594" height="398" alt="Different header + navigation styles for submdomains on jim-nielsen.com including a hamburger button." />
        
        </p><p>As I began to explore more possibilities than I planned for, things started to get out of hand.</p>
        <h2 id="v3-do-more-more-more">v3: Do More. MORE. MORE!!</h2>
        <p>Questions I began asking:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Why aren‚Äôt these all under the same domain?!</li>
        <li>What if I had a single domain for feeds across all of them, e.g. <code>feeds.jim-nielsen.com</code>?</li>
        <li>What about icons instead of words?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v3.png" width="1184" height="659" alt="Four mobile-sized mockups for subdomains on jim-nielsen.com, each one getting a different highlight color." />
        
        </p><p>Wait, wait, wait Jim. Consistent navigation across inconsistent sites. That‚Äôs the goal. Pare it back a little.</p>
        <h2 id="v4-reigning-it-back-in">v4: Reigning It Back In</h2>
        <p>To counter my exploratory ambitions, I told myself I needed to ship something without the need to modify the entire design style of all my sites.</p>
        <p>So how do I do that?</p>
        <p>That got me back to a simpler premise: consistent navigation across my inconsistent sites.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/new-pill-v4.png" width="1070" height="768" alt="Dynamic-island-like navigational pill for the subdomains on www, blog, and notes subdomains of jim-nielsen.com" />
        
        </p><p>Better ‚Äî and implementable.</p>
        <h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
        <p>The implementation was pretty simple. I basically just forked my previous web component and changed some styles. That‚Äôs it.</p>
        <p>The only thing I did different was I moved the web component JS file from being part of my <code>www.jim-nielsen.com</code> git repository to a standalone file (not under git control) on my CDN.</p>
        <p>This felt like one of the exceptions to the rule of always keeping stuff under version control. It‚Äôs more of the classic FTP-style approach to web development. Granted, it‚Äôs riskier, but it‚Äôs also way more flexible. And I‚Äôm good with that trade-off for now. (Ask me again in a few months if I‚Äôve done anything terrible and now have regrets.)</p>
        <p>Each site implements the component like this (with a different <code>subdomain</code> attribute for each site):</p>
        <pre><code class="language language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;module&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/shared/jim-site-switcher.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">jim-site-switcher</span> <span class="hljs-attr">subdomain</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;blog&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">jim-site-switcher</span>&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>That‚Äôs really all there is to say. Thanks to Zach for <a href="https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/114942811780696272" >prodding me to make this post</a>.</p>

      <title>Classifiers and cosmotechnics</title>
      <link>https://daverupert.com/2025/08/classifiers-and-cosmotechnics/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôve been playing around with Midjourney for work and the one thing that makes Stable Diffusion cool and useful to me is the <code>--sref</code> flag to summon results in a specific visual style or ‚Äústyle reference‚Äù (e.g. <a href="https://midlibrary.io/styles/83450e8">Celestial Swirlscape</a> is <code>--sref 2566192150</code>). They differ a bit from traditional or ‚Äúartist‚Äù styles (e.g. ‚ÄúIn the style of Picasso‚Äù or ‚ÄúRip off Studio Ghibli‚Äù) but can be that or they can be more generic or compositional like ‚Äú<a href="https://midlibrary.io/styles/78ed0e">Pink Retronetic Dreamscape</a>‚Äù. I‚Äôve read <a href="https://midlibrary.io/midguide/deep-dive-into-midjourney-sref-codes">a deep-dive on SREF codes</a> and it‚Äôs still a bit unclear how they work to me. They‚Äôre like a hybrid between prompt shorthand and style classification. Curated and collected by humans, but a code generated by machines. I have to imagine there‚Äôs some clumped circles on a node graph chart somewhere that determine this‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt know those answers.</p>
        <p>The idea of a classifier (human assisted or otherwise) that can suck up and analyze all the art on the internet and end up with a 10-digit number that represents nearly any visual style of imagery I‚Äôve ever seen is mind-bending. Not to mention the ability to overlay that style reference on any image I want in under a minute. ‚ÄúAnime waifu. <code>--sref 3196580341</code>‚Äù is the ‚ÄúTea. Earl gray. Hot‚Äù of digital imagery. It feels unreal.</p>
        <p>Could we apply a universal classifier to blog posts so that your ‚Äúlongread about cool bugs‚Äù and my ‚Äúlongread about cool bugs‚Äù have the same <code>--sref</code> tag? And then we retro-actively apply human-readable tag names to this stylistic tag? And then could I subscribe to a feed of those specific types of posts? That might be interesting‚Ä¶ or radicalizing.</p>
        <p>Design tokens? Could those be a system of classifiers instead of arbitrary language? Probably not. But why not? Web design almost certainly could, if it isn‚Äôt already.</p>
        <p>While the idea of classifiers tickles the logical computer part of my brain, reducing the entirety of the visual arts down to a set of ten billion categories offends the artist part of my brain. It is odious. There‚Äôs an observer effect to it whereby in the act of classifying the art you‚Äôve limited and altered your ability to understand it. And any mimicked generation has an imposter-like, soul-less character to it, no matter the quality. I can‚Äôt explain that. Even though I‚Äôve seen the machine generate incredible art beyond anything I‚Äôm capable of, I still feel that intangible void on my retinas when I interact with it.</p>
        <p>My wife and I were joking about how the algorithm is serving us videos about certain personality quirks that map to (possibly made-up) niche disorders. My wife ‚Äìwho can remember the melody to every guitar solo but can‚Äôt remember the words of the songs from her own band‚Äì has a diagnosis from Dr. TikTok that she has ‚Äúpolyphonic perception‚Äù. My personality quirks all point to my particular flavor of ADHD. How long until our entire personalities are all tied to a collection of niche diagnoses? How long until our brains are all classified by a ten-digit number? That could be incredibly useful for getting help but brings up nature versus nurture questions for me. Did God make me this way or did I dent the packaging?  Can people with <code>--brainSpiceRef 2566192150</code> even apply for this job? How long until the machines build these types of preferences? Myers-Briggs but instead of made by a racist, it‚Äôs made by MechaHitler.</p>
        <p>When I think about the future I want, it always comes down to one idea: I want <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZvpIE5g5Fo">a pod-like chamber I can walk into</a> that scans my entire body, makes bleep-bloop noises to show that it‚Äôs working, and prints out a receipt with a list of all my ailments (cancers, deformities, disorders, and otherwise) and recommends a diet and exercise plan until my next scheduled visit to the pod. Bonus points if it orders groceries accordingly after my entire family has exited the chamber. I‚Äôm aware this has ‚ÄúBig Theranos Energy‚Äù and is an incredible surface area for conspiracy theories‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs the science fiction future I want. Classifiers seem inevitable on that pathway. But how do we preserve our humanity when reducing the human race ‚Äìwho we are and what we create‚Äì down to a series of ten-digit codes?</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[I had an idea that <a href="https://globalvoices.org/">Global Voices</a>, at least in concept, could help us prepare in the US for what's coming. I wrote: I'd love to have is an <b>idea-sharing network</b> where i could drop this idea in a box named "helping the US stay free" and have it find it's way to the right people in Ukraine who are saying "if only I could talk to people in the US trying to figure this out, we know so much about this!" That's the thing. How to connect know-how with the place that needs to know. To make our resistance more effective use the lessons learned in Ukraine over the last decades.]]>

        <![CDATA[The purpose of the National Guard occupation of American cities is to control who votes. It doesn‚Äôt take much disruption to turn a blue district red. They just allocated <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/big-beautiful-bill-immigration-border-security/">$170 billion</a> to fund ICE. They don't need all that money for border enforcement. It's meant to fund the transformation of the US into a Russian-style oligarchy. That's fear-inducing, but Ukraine has been fighting against becoming a  Russian-style oligarchy for decades, with ups and downs, but so far, considerable success.]]>

      <link>https://blog.dshr.org/2025/08/2025-optical-media-durability-update.html</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Seven years ago I posted <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/08/optical-media-durability.html"><i>Optical Media Durability</i></a> and discovered:<br />
        <blockquote class="tr_bq">
        Surprisingly, I'm getting good data from CD-Rs more than 14 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 12 years old. Your mileage may vary.</blockquote>
        Here are the subsequent annual updates:<br />

        </ul>
        It is time once again for the mind-numbing process of feeding 45 disks through the readers to verify their checksums, and yet again this year every single MD5 was successfully verified. Below the fold, the details.<br />
        <a name='more'></a><br />
        <br />
        <table align="right" border="3" cols="5">
        <thead>
        <tr><td>Month</td><td>Media</td><td>Good</td><td>Bad</td><td>Vendor</td>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td>01/04</td><td>CD-R</td><td align="right">5x</td><td align="right">0</td><td>GQ</td></tr>

        </tbody>
        </table>
        The fields in the table are as follows:<br />
        <ul>
        <li><i>Month</i>: The date marked on the media in Sharpie, and verified via the on-disk metadata.</li>
        <li><i>Media</i>: The type of media.</li>
        <li><i>Good</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which all MD5 checksums were correctly verified.</li>
        <li><i>Bad</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which any file failed MD5 verification.</li>
        <li><i>Vendor</i>: the vendor name on the media</li>
        </ul>
        The drives I use from ASUS and LG report read errors from the CDs and older DVDs but verify the MD5s correctly.<br />
        <br />
        Surprisingly, with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost media, and consumer drives, I'm getting good data from CD-Rs more than 21 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 19 years old. Your mileage may 
        vary. Tune in again next year for another episode.<br />
        <br />Previously I found a <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/08/optical-media-durability-update.html?showComment=1632161672704#c889599305877938325">NetBSD1.2 CD</a> dating from October 1996. Each directory has checksums generated by <tt>cksum(1)</tt>, all but one of which verified correctly despite a few read errors. So some of the data on that CD is bad after nearly 29 years.<br />

        <![CDATA[What if you made a social network out of RSS? Then your blogroll would be the list of people you follow. Their updates would show up in a reverse chronologic list of posts that would look like something from <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinesnapshot.png">Bluesky</a> or <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinetwitter.png">Twitter</a>. You could view a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timeline.png">list</a> of the people you follow, and expand each person to see their most recent five posts, summarized, with a link to each to read the whole thing. Since there are no limits to the length of a post in RSS there would be no limit to the length of one of these posts, but of course you wouldn't show all the text in the timeline without the reader clicking on something.]]>

It's hard to watch at times, because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes">main character</a> of the show, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is such a horrible person. She lies to everyone about everything, but she's cute and the VCs like her, so they pump hundreds of millions of dollars into her startup, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos">Theranos</a>, which was a real company, and made a product that never worked, but she doesn't get around to telling anyone that, including the board of directors, until long after it's too late. I haven't reached the end yet, but I know how it ends, because it's based on a true story. She ends up in the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Camp,_Bryan">prison</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> is in, in Texas. The only reason I mention it is that in my tenure in Silicon Valley, about 30 years worth, I saw everything she did, done by other entrepreneurs and VCs, in real life. Only now, in the second Trump administration, its craptitude is maxed out far beyond anything I saw personally. They're selling the biggest lie yet, that they've invented machines that think. This is not true, and it's so big a lie, its too-big-to-fail quotient is far higher than anything we've seen before. ChatGPT should stop pretending to be human because that will destroy real humans who believe it. But the euphoria is so great, they're probably going to continue to insist it is capable of thought, and that leads to something far worse than Theranos, or any of the other billion-dollar scams they have foisted on us previously.]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In the middle of the night on the morning of July 4th, a storm parked over the Texas Hill Country and caused the Guadalupe river to rise more than 25 feet in two hours. 135 dead, including dozens of children from summer camps along the river. As a parent, this is the greatest tragedy you could imagine. My heart goes out to the families and friends who lost a little one that week.</p>
        <p>As a Texan, this is yet another tragedy in a growing list of rare but forecastable tragedies where federal, state, and local officials failed Texans. I‚Äôm tired.</p>
        <p>With that event casting a dark shadow on the summer acknowledged, here‚Äôs a recap of the last couple months.</p>
        <h2>A trip to the Grand Canyon</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/grandcanyon.jpg" width="1200" height="675" alt="the grand canyon near bright angel trailhead"/>
        <p>In late June my family stole away for a quick trip to Arizona. My in-laws bought a vacation place in Flagstaff to escape the Phoenix heat. We wanted to check out the new place and figured we could do something American and tag on a quick trip to the Grand Canyon.</p>
        <p>On the morning of the second day we arrived at Grand Canyon National Park early. We found a good parking spot steps from the canyon‚Äôs edge and told our kids to get out and see the view. I‚Äôve been to the canyon a couple times but nothing can truly prepare you for the enormity and pastel grandeur you‚Äôre about to see. I enjoyed re-living the first glimpses through my kids‚Äô collective gasps of awe‚Ä¶ and after about 10 minutes they were ready to go home and get on their iPads.</p>
        <p>We milled around the park for nearly two hours making frequent stops. We stopped at the Devil‚Äôs Watchtower on the way out of the park which I‚Äôd recommend. All-in-all, we saw something truly remarkable together and my wife and I felt like we checked off a big ‚ÄúThis is good for you and you‚Äôll thank us later‚Äù parenting checkbox.</p>
        <p>The next day the kids rode back with the grandparents to Phoenix while my wife and I took a short detour to go see Sedona. All these years visiting Arizona and I‚Äôd never been. We don‚Äôt buy into all the energy crystal woo-woo the town advertises, but it‚Äôs a beautiful and inspiring piece of America with incredible vistas and sculpture-like red stone mountains. I‚Äôd like to spend more time there.</p>
        <p>We had a couple days in Phoenix to hang with cousins and celebrated my great-nephew‚Äôs second birthday. He‚Äôs a cool dude. Mid-week we headed back to Austin to send the kids to summer camp. That week could have been a great one for my wife and I to enjoy an empty house, but I ended up (over-)working all week.</p>
        <h2>Trip to San Diego</h2>
        <p>The day after the kids got back from summer camp we packed our bags again and headed to San Diego with my wife‚Äôs entire family. The next four days were beach days; digging holes, <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/07/always-buy-the-yamaha/">playing guitar</a>, hitting the smashball, dozing off to books, and chasing a toddler around. I stayed in my solar fortress most of the time to avoid my enemy: The Sun.</p>
        <p>But it wouldn‚Äôt be a Rupert Family Vacation without some calamities! On the second day my son got the worst sunburn of his life; no blisters, just red. He‚Äôd survive‚Ä¶ but he didn‚Äôt know that. I sympathize because I had tons of sunburns as a kid. When it itches, it sucks.</p>
        <p>And then there‚Äôs my daughter‚Ä¶</p>
        <p>At the end of the week we tagged on a couple more days and visited Austin friends who spend the summer in Encinitas. Our daughters who have been besties since daycare slotted right back into their brand of silly lip sync routines and giggling. To soak up more beach time, we hiked down the cliff to Beacons beach and set up some chairs in the rocks while the girls boogie boarded their hearts out having the time of their life until‚Ä¶</p>
        <p>My daughter comes to us holding her arm crying. When she reached for the loose boogie board leash she slammed her hand down and said she felt something fold over her arm and sting her. We walked over to the lifeguard stand and got the bad news, ‚ÄúThat looks like a sting ray.‚Äù</p>
        <p>The untold irony here is all week long my daughter was telling anyone who would listen that her two greatest fears about the ocean were: getting caught in a rip current and getting stung by a stingray. We tried to diffuse those fears but she kept talking about it. And here we were, the prophecy came true.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúI can call a lifeguard truck to meet you at the top of the hill but you have to take care of it now.‚Äù Uh-oh. That‚Äôs when I knew we were in a serious situation. We said no to the lifeguard truck but needed to submerge her arm in 115¬∫F water (hot tap water) for 30-90 minutes to neutralize the proteins in the venom. We hiked back up the cliff and walked the three blocks to the house. Tears the whole way.</p>
        <p>After a couple hours everything was sore but stable. She‚Äôs a tough kid and that was a difficult situation. What a champ.</p>
        <h2>We survived: A skunk attack</h2>
        <p>Late one night my daughter (who has a sensitive smeller) said ‚ÄúSomething smells like skunk!‚Äù I caught a faint whiff of it and thought ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably some neighbors smoking weed‚Äù and opened the back door to assess the situation and in rushed my two mutts, one of them covered in skunk juice! Yikes!</p>
        <p>We did our best to corral them to the garage where we washed them with an internet-recommended concoction. I can‚Äôt even describe the degree to how awful this was. The smell infiltrated our house and sulfur burned in the eyes and nose all night long. We spent the next day Fabreezing and disposing of any rogue object the smell might have transferred to: the backdoor mat, collars, one kids sandal, the dead skunk near the trash‚Ä¶ Ah, gross.</p>
        <p>A skunk attack is not a situation you can control (dogs being dogs) but it‚Äôs not one I want to relive any time soon.</p>
        <h2>Another school year begins</h2>
        <p>This week we strap ourselves into the bobsled and push the sled downhill on an out-of-control course where the breaks do nothing and it sends us crashing into Christmas. Feeling optimistic about this year, but there will be more homework for both our kids which is historically not a strength we operate in as a family. Lord help us.</p>
        <h2>Stats</h2>
        <p>Here you go, number perverts. All the dopamine deep-dives and drive-thrus I collected over the summer.</p>
        <h3>üß†¬†<strong>Learning</strong></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Sovietology -  Based on a space race analogy I heard at work I made a deep-dive on the Soviet space program which led me to Sovietology and trying to understand how the Soviet central planning system (‚Äúcybernetics‚Äù) failed its fellow comrades.</li>
        <li>ADHD - Been watching a lot of videos on ADHD and trying to understand it more</li>
        <li>Minimalism and decluttering - ADHD videos lead me into minimalism and decluttering videos and it makes a difference if you view clutter as stimulus. If I could just get the rest of the family on board‚Ä¶</li>
        <li>Drawing - I‚Äôd like to be good at drawing, so I spent a lot of learning about shapes, perspectives, sketching, and more</li>
        <li>Studio Setups - Because ShopTalk has a YouTube now, I‚Äôve become a little bit obsessed with optimal YouTube setups but I haven‚Äôt done anything‚Ä¶ yet</li>
        <li>Budgeting - After all our summer trips and feeling spent (physically and fiscally), I sat down one weekend and did some budgeting and ingested a lot on the subject.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Health and wellness</h3>
        <p>A lot of updates here but still untangling the Gordion knot of stress, anxiety, weight, and ADHD. I‚Äôm talking to doctors and making some changes and I believe they are helping even if it‚Äôs not fully realized yet.</p>
        <h3>üìù¬†<strong>Blogging</strong></h3>
        <p>Over a dozen posts over two months with some vacations in there, that‚Äôs about all you can ask for.</p>

        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/42C0Bx1">System Collapse</a> <small>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</small> - The last book in the Murderbot Diaries. This one was a slog, to be honest. The action at the end was good but the crescendo right before that, the big group project‚Ä¶ was disappointing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3SZMflH">The Wrong Stuff</a> <small>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</small> - A great book about the relative failure of the Soviet Cosmonaut program compared to NASA even though the USSR had many ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù they did so without regard to the safety and stability of their program and rockets.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/43qaO1z">Space Battleship Yamato</a> <small>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω</small> - Got this from Kinokuniya to satiate my retro space manga obsession. It delivered on the space opera promise but had a lot of the early-days manga pitfalls. That wasn‚Äôt a deal-breaker for me but could be for some I‚Äôm sure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/447GMzL">Red Plenty</a> <small>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</small> - A historical fictional narrative about site managers and scientists under Khrushchev‚Äôs rule. It paints a nice picture about the economics (‚Äúcybernetics‚Äù) and central planning of that time, but sometimes the narrative was too thick (like Dostoyevsky thick). Reaffirming I‚Äôm a non-fiction guy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3TZuW4Y">ADHD and Us</a> <small>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</small> - A good book for people in a relationship where one or more partners are neurodiverse. Recommended by my psychiatrist.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/4o98ggp">A Different Kind of Power</a> <small>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω</small> - Jacinda Arden‚Äôs autobiography is a bit hard to read because of how calm, cool, collected, and capable she seems compared to her American contemporary Donald Trump who was nothing but chaos and incompetence.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3U1gfOP">Dungeon Crawler Carl</a> <small></small> - [In progress]</p>

        <li>
        <p><a href="https://amzn.to/44PvjFy">Moral Ambition</a> <small>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</small> - I enjoyed Bregman‚Äôs other books more, but this book certainly is challenging. It asks you to consider how you can make the biggest, moral, positive change and adjust your life towards that goal. That certainly tugs at my heartstrings but is a tough call to action in uncertain times.</p>

        <li>Superman - I enjoyed a DC movie; a Superman movie! Unbelievable. Has James Gunn saved the DC cinematic universe? Hopefully.</li>
        <li>K-Pop Demon Slayers (Netflix) - An wonderful animated film and you can see the foundation of fun from the creative and technical teams come out. Great job Sony Animation.</li>
        <li>Fantastic Four: First Steps - The art direction in this movie is incredible‚Ä¶ fantastic even. A real cinematic feat. Worth seeing in theaters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>TV</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Welcome to Wrexham S4 (Hulu) - Up the town. Unreal ending.</li>
        <li>Murderbot (Apple TV) - Loved the books‚Ä¶ and uh‚Ä¶ you can watch the show, if you want to, it‚Äôs fine I guess.</li>
        <li>Mythic Quest S5 (Apple TV) - Not for everyone but feels algorithmically generated for me.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Streaming</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Game Changer S7 (Dropout) - This season of Game Changer has managed to outdo itself and that‚Äôs an incredible a feat.</li>

        <ul>
        <li>Mobile Suite Gundam Gquuuuuux (Prime)</li>

        <p>This hobby isn‚Äôt dead yet! I‚Äôve got five or so in the backlog but three of them are practice kits for a larger project I have in mind. In service to that project, I tried my hand at anime cel-shading an Entry Grade RX-78-2. I tried half-a-dozen application techniques and didn‚Äôt find a way that I liked. I need to do more research and keep trying.</p>

        <li>Made my homepage tie-dyed for funsies. It‚Äôs based off the accent color and changes a bit every day.</li>
        <li>Built some automation for my vibechecks, will hopefully post more later.</li>

        <li>The only <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22billionaire-proof%22">billionaire-proof</a> social network will be based on RSS. </li>

      <title>Bottomless Subtleties</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/bottomless-subtleties/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Jason Fried writes in his post <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/knives-and-battleships-ac8dc8c2" >‚ÄúKnives and battleships‚Äù</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Specific tools and familiar ingredients combined in different ratios, different molds, for different purposes. Like a baker working from the same tight set of pantry ingredients to make a hundred distinct recipes. You wouldn&#39;t turn to them and say &quot;enough with the butter, flour, sugar, baking powder, and eggs already!&quot;</p>
        <p>Getting the same few things right in different ways is a career&#39;s worth of work.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Mastery comes from a lifetime of putting together the basics in different combinations. </p>
        <p>I think of Beethoven‚Äôs 5th and its famous ‚Äúshort-short-short-long‚Äù motif. The entire symphony is essentially the same core idea repeated and developed relentlessly! The same four notes (da-da-da-DAH!) moving between instruments, changing keys, etc.</p>
        <p>Beethoven took something basic ‚Äî a four note motif ‚Äî and extracted an enormous set of variations. Its genius is in illustrating how much can be explored and expressed within constraints (rather than piling on ‚Äúmore and more‚Äù novel stuff).</p>
        <p>Back to Jason‚Äôs point: the simplest building blocks in any form ‚Äî music, code, paint, cooking ‚Äî implemented with restraint can be combined in an almost infinite set of pleasing ways.</p>
        <p>As <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/precarious-modern-computing/" >Devine noted</a> (and I constantly link back to): we haven‚Äôt even begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with less.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Before starting the upgrade, make sure your <code>/boot</code> partition is at least 768 MB in size, and has about 300 MB free. If your system does not have a separate /boot partition, there should be nothing to do. &ndash; <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/release-notes/issues.html#ensure-boot-has-enough-free-space">5.1.5. Ensure /boot has enough free spaceÔÉÅ</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>I am missing 34M for boot!</p>
        
        <pre><code># df -h | grep boot
        /dev/sda2               734M  141M  540M  21% /boot
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;m ignoring this for the moment. :(</p>
        
        <p>Deleting files from the last upgrade:</p>
        
        <pre><code>find /etc '(' -name '*.dpkg-*' -o -name '*.ucf-*' -o -name '*.merge-error' ')' -exec rm '{}' ';'
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Purging config files:</p>
        
        <pre><code>apt purge '?narrow(?config-files)'
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Removing old stuff and making space:</p>
        
        <pre><code>apt autoremove
        apt clean
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Lots of reading.
        Replacing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> with <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources</code>:</p>
        
        <pre><code>Types: deb
        URIs: https://deb.debian.org/debian
        Suites: trixie trixie-updates
        Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
        Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
        
        Types: deb
        URIs: https://security.debian.org/debian-security
        Suites: trixie-security
        Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
        Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>And then:</p>
        
        <pre><code>apt update
        apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs
        apt full-upgrade
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;m ignoring the warnings about directories the upgrade process was unable to delete:
        The ones I did check contained scripts and the like.
        I would have felt OK to delete directories with generated files, or files modified by me.
        But this? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
        
        <p>Conflicts I ran into:</p>
        
        <pre><code>/etc/exim4/conf.d/main/03_exim4-config_tlsoptions
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>This file showed up as a conflict but it was nothing I remember doing. Install the maintainer version!</p>
        
        <pre><code>/etc/systemd/journald.conf
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I had added <code>SystemMaxUse=200M</code> and <code>MaxRetentionSec=7d</code> because I didn&rsquo;t want to give the log files that much space. So I redid those changes for the maintainer version.</p>
        
        <pre><code>/etc/pam.d/login
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;m not sure what this is about. Did I comment <code>session    optional   pam_motd.so motd=/run/motd.dynamic</code>? Perhaps I did. Let&rsquo;s go with the maintainer version and see if that&rsquo;s OK.</p>
        
        <p>To do after the upgrade:</p>
        
        <pre><code>rm /var/log/wtmp* /var/log/lastlog* /var/log/btmp*
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I noticed that the sway background image is back.
        I had to add a line at the very end of my config file:</p>
        
        <pre><code>#
        # Debian
        #
        # Include all the extra config
        include /etc/sway/config.d/*
        # Override the background
        output * bg &quot;#333333&quot; solid_color
        </code></pre>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-11</strong>. The things that aren&rsquo;t working on the server:</p>
        
        <p>Getting Node.js installed was a pain. It has a separate sources list from NodeSource. ‚òπÔ∏è</p>
        
        <p><em>Solved, hopefully.</em></p>
        
        <p>Services that rely on Monit starting a Mojolicious app via Hypnotoad no longer work.
        Monit claims &ldquo;File &lsquo;/home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/hypnotoad&rsquo; does not exist&rdquo;. ‚òπÔ∏è</p>
        
        <p><em>Rewriting the wrappers as systemd services.</em></p>
        
        <p>My local Emacs can no longer connect to the server via Tramp. It just hangs. <code>ssh</code> and <code>mosh</code> still work, the config files are unchanged. ‚òπÔ∏è</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-12</strong>. Ah, if I start Gnome, my old enemy is back: <code>localsearch-3</code>.</p>
        
        <p>Looking at <a href="2018-05-07_Laptop_Fan">2018-05-07 Laptop Fan</a> and trying to disable to crawling:</p>
        
        <pre><code># gsettings get org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files crawling-interval 
        -2
        # gsettings get org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files enable-monitors
        false
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>The old <code>tracker</code> package is now a transitional package that depends on <code>tinysparql</code>. Trying to <code>apt remove</code> either of them will attempt to remove <code>gnome-session gnome-sushi tinysparql xdg-desktop-portal-gnome gnome-session-xsession nautilus tracker-extract</code>. Fuuuck.</p>
        
        <p>Looking at the man pages, I get the feeling that <code>localsearch-daemon(3)</code> is what I need kill the processes. But how to disable them?</p>
        
        <pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .service
        /etc/systemd/user/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
        /usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-3.service
        /usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-control-3.service
        /usr/lib/systemd/user/localsearch-writeback-3.service
        /usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
        /var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/localsearch-3.service.dsh-also
        /var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-user-helper-enabled/gnome-session.target.wants/localsearch-3.service
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>OK, some candidates!</p>
        
        <p>The manual page for <code>localsearch-3(1)</code> mentioned that it was started by a <code>.desktop</code> file.
        But perhaps I can just disable the service?</p>
        
        <p>Maybe not.</p>
        
        <pre><code># systemctl --user disable localsearch-3
        The following unit files have been enabled in global scope. This means
        they will still be started automatically after a successful disablement
        in user scope:
        localsearch-3.service
        # sudo systemctl disable localsearch-3.service
        Failed to disable unit: Unit localsearch-3.service does not exist
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to do.</p>
        
        <pre><code># locate localsearch|grep .desktop
        /etc/xdg/autostart/localsearch-3.desktop
        /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/localsearch-3.0/extract-modules/libextract-desktop.so
        /usr/share/localsearch3/extract-rules/10-desktop.rule
        /usr/share/localsearch3/miners/org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Miner.Files.service
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s that first file. But how to disable <em>that</em>?</p>
        
        <p>Ah, I am not alone. With that info I found <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=299586">a discussion on the Arch Linux forum</a> with various strategies being discussed. I will try to change the <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled</code> line to <code>false</code> and see whether that helps. And while I am at it, I will also change <code>X-GNOME-HiddenUnderSystemd</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and I can no longer edit remote files with my Emacs at home. It just hangs there and waits for the prompt or something, I guess.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-13</strong>. Oh, and that annoying Gnome keyring? <a href="https://www.xmodulo.com/disable-gnome-keyring-linux-desktop.html">How to disable GNOME Keyring on GNOME desktop</a> by Dan Nanni suggests to copy the <code>gnome-keyring-*.desktop</code> files from <code>/etc/xdg/autostart</code> to <code>~/.config/autostart</code> and append the line <code>X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false</code> to each one.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-14</strong>. The chkrootkit mail I get every day has a lot of useless information. One looks like <em>all</em> the dotfiles? Ugh.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2025-08-17</strong>. Ah, at the very end of the <code>chkrootkit</code> email is the answer:</p>
        
        <pre><code>cp -a /var/log/chkrootkit/log.today /var/log/chkrootkit/log.expected
        </code></pre>]]>

I'm working a few hours a day on the integration of writing and timelines built around feeds. Instead of using Bluesky or Mastodon, with their limits, we use WordPress for storage. It has none of their limits, has a high performance open source server back-end, debugged complete API, it's not without problems, but far ahead of where the competition is in terms are reliablity and ease of implementation. <i>To be part of this network, all you need is an RSS feed. </i>Seems pretty openly billionaire-proof wouldn't you say.]]>

I don't want it giving me answers to questions I didn't ask, because it's trying to navigate in my mind, and it has no information about that, so it's basically always wrong. I keep looking back on problems that took hours to solve because it drove the process and I went along with it. I want to tell it in advance to not make suggestions, to just answer questions.

        <![CDATA[<p>Conrad Irwin has an article on the Zed blog <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software" >‚ÄúWhy LLMs Can&#39;t Really Build Software‚Äù</a>. He says it boils down to:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>the distinguishing factor of effective engineers is their ability to build and maintain clear mental models</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We do this by:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Building a mental model of what <em>you want</em> to do</li>
        <li>Building a mental model of what the <em>code does</em></li>
        <li>Reducing the difference between the two</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It‚Äôs kind of an interesting observation about how we (as humans)  problem solve vs. how we use LLMs to problem solve:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>With LLMs, you stuff more and more information into context until it (hopefully) has enough to generate a solution.</li>
        <li>With your brain, you tweak, revise, or simplify your mental model more and more until the solution presents itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One adds information ‚Äî complexity you might even say ‚Äî¬†to solve a problem. The other eliminates it.</p>
        <p>You know what that sort of makes me think of? NPM driven development.</p>
        <p>Solving problems with LLMs is like solving front-end problems with NPM: the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù comes through installing more and more things ‚Äî adding more and more context, i.e. more and more packages.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>LLM: Problem? Add more context. </li>
        <li>NPM: Problem? There‚Äôs a package for that.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contrast that with a solution that comes through simplification. You don‚Äôt add more context. You simplify your mental model so you need less to solve a problem ‚Äî if you solve it at all, perhaps you eliminate the problem entirely!</p>
        <p>Rather than install another package to fix what ails you, you simplify your mental model which often eliminates the problem you had in the first place; thus eliminating the need to solve any problem at all, or to add any additional context or complexity (or dependency).</p>
        <p>As I‚Äôm typing this, I‚Äôm thinking of that image of the evolution of the Raptor engine, where it evolved in simplicity:</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/more-context-bro-rocket-1.jpg" width="540" height="339" alt="Photograph of three versions of the raptor engine, each one getting progressively simplified in mechanical parts." />
        
        </p><p>This stands in contrast to my working with LLMs, which often wants more and more context from me to get to a generative solution:</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/more-context-bro-rocket-2.jpg" width="540" height="339" alt="Photograph of three versions of the raptor engine, but the image is reversed showing the engine get progressively complicated in mechanical parts over time. Each engine represents an LLM prompt." />
        
        </p><p>I know, I know. There‚Äôs probably a false equivalence here. This entire post started as <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com" >a note</a> and I just kept going. This post itself needs further thought and simplification. But that‚Äôll have to come in a subsequent post, otherwise this never gets published lol.</p>

      <title>2025-08-15 The liberal democrats in Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-15-fdp</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-08-15-the-liberal-democrats-in-switzerland">2025-08-15 The liberal democrats in Switzerland</h1>
        
        <p>One of the founding parties of the current state are the liberal democrats. My limited understanding of the situation is that they were all about liberty ‚Äì against the ancient r√©gime (the semi-feudal system before Napoleon and the French revolution helped us get rid of them) and against the church. My wife still remembers the small-scale feuding betweens catholics and protestants. My father in law still remembers that uneasy peace: going to school as a protestant in a mostly catholic village. His father was very much engaged in that struggle against the powers of the church.</p>
        
        <p>These days, those battles are no longer that important. And so the liberal democrats turned to economic freedom. They turned into the part of bankers and industrialist. They rode that neoliberal devil. And now as it is faltering, a new change is afoot. Sadly, when they last looked for leadership, the only candidate who stood up was a xenophobe. But we already have a party of racists! The Swiss people&rsquo;s party. These people were originally more of a farmer&rsquo;s party but under the influence of billionaire Blocher they also rode that neoliberal horse. Down with taxes! Up with the banks! Down with regulation! Down with the European Union! Yeah, Blocher was a good demagogue.</p>
        
        <p>The liberal democrats liked what they heard about taxes and didn&rsquo;t mind kicking out foreigners and so they worked together. But you know how it is: When in doubt, people prefer the clearer message. And on the non-demagoguery front, there was a strange thing that happened with the Green party. Like in many places, they had a left wing and a right wing. And their differences became so large, that the split! The Greens are now &ldquo;melon green&rdquo;: green on the outside and red on the inside. They work well with the socialists. The right wingers were the green liberals. The rational voice calling for a lowering of taxes.</p>
        
        <p>A while ago there was a session of the liberal democrats where one of the delegates present was muttering against some decisions in favour of the environment. &ldquo;If we continue like this we might as well join the liberal greens!&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Ah, and that&rsquo;s the dilemma. Those who want less taxes and don&rsquo;t mind kicking foreigners around can join the Swiss people&rsquo;s party. Those who want less taxes and still save at least some of the planet can join the liberal greens.</p>
        
        <p>Naturally, one of the more famous members of the Anti-Vaccination party, whose star has not been rising in recent months, wants to join the liberal democrats again.</p>
        
        <p>That&rsquo;s how far this party has fallen.</p>

Then I realized that sometimes in software I'm climbing a cliff that's too tall to climb in one session, so I have to carry a tent and backpack with food and water. I hate this kind of programming more than anything, because it comes from not having a high-level enough runtime to support me in big corner turns. Or not having invested enough time in creating a layer I can build on. Anyway I'm in the middle of one of those corner-turns now. Hell has not broken loose although at times it looks like it might have. I'm being sure not to create another mess that needs to be cleaned up in the future. Not stressful, but I'd rather be doing anything but this. :-)]]>

        <![CDATA[<h1 id="2025-08-12-influential-games">2025-08-12 Influential games</h1>
        
        <p><a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@Ashigaru" title="@Ashigaru@dice.camp">@Ashigaru</a> mentioned how D&amp;D 3.0 was really important for him at the time and <a class="account" href="https://metalhead.club/@dereisenhofer" title="@dereisenhofer@metalhead.club">@dereisenhofer</a> mentioned him playing DSA (Das Schwarze Auge, i.e. The Dark Eye). And I thought about my gaming history.</p>
        
        <p>I moved from The Dark Eye 1st ed that I played as a kid and again as a 15-year old to AD&amp;D 1st ed when I was around 16 because a Canadian exchange student said it was the original and obviously it had to better. Some mere months later my group switched to the new AD&amp;D 2nd ed because obviously new had to be better. And then my interest waned.</p>
        
        <p>Years later, I got into M20 because of the blogs, and my players wanted to play the just released D&amp;D 3.5 because obviously new had to better. With the switch to D&amp;D 4 I put my foot down and went with Labyrinth Lord ‚Äì and lost almost all my players. ü•∫</p>
        
        <p>But I found new ones and kept on playing. So for me, D&amp;D 3.5 stands for those special years just before the OSR blogs took off, when I came back to the game.</p>

        In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/07/the-selling-of-ai.html"><i>The Selling Of AI</i></a> I compared the market strategy behind the AI bubble to the drug-dealer's algorithm, "the first one's free". As the drugs take hold of an addict, three things happen:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Their price rises.</li>
          <li>The addict needs bigger doses for the same effect.</li>
          <li>Their deleterious effects kick in. </li>
        </ul>
        As expected, this what is happening to AI. Follow me below the fold for the details.<br />
        <span><a name='more'></a></span>
        <br />
        <h3>The price rises</h3>
        Ethan Ding starts <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed"><i>tokens are getting more expensive</i></a> thus:<br />
        <blockquote>
        imagine you start a company knowing that consumers won't pay more than $20/month. fine, you think, classic vc playbook - charge at cost, sacrifice margins for growth. you've done the math on cac, ltv, all that. but here's where it gets interesting: you've seen the <a href="https://a16z.com/llmflation-llm-inference-cost/">a16z chart showing llm costs dropping 10x every year</a>.<br />
        <br />
        so you think: i'll break even today at $20/month, and when models get 10x cheaper next year, boom - 90% margins. the losses are temporary. the profits are inevitable.<br />
        <br />
        it‚Äôs so simple a VC associate could understand it:<br />
        <br />
        year 1: break even at $20/month<br />
        <br />
        year 2: 90% margins as compute drops 10x<br />
        <br />
        year 3: yacht shopping<br />
        <br />
        it‚Äôs an understandable strategy: "the cost of LLM inference has dropped by a factor of 3 every 6 months, we‚Äôll be fine‚Äù

        The workers will have access to ChatGPT Enterprise, a type of account that includes access to frontier models and cutting-edge features with relatively high token limits, alongside a more robust commitment to data privacy than general consumers of ChatGPT get. ChatGPT Enterprise has been trialed over the past several months at several corporations and other types of large organizations.<br />
        <br />
        The workers will also have unlimited access to advanced features like Deep Research and Advanced Voice Mode for a 60-day period. After the one-year trial period, the agencies are under no obligation to renew.

        But that's not one of the two problems Ding is discussing.  He is wondering why instead of yacht shopping, <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">this happened</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        but after 18 months, margins are about as negative as they‚Äôve ever been‚Ä¶ windsurf‚Äôs been sold for parts, and claude code has had to roll back their original unlimited $200/mo tier this week.<br />
        <br />
        companies are still bleeding. the models got cheaper - gpt-3.5 costs 10x less than it used to. but somehow the margins got worse, not better.
        </blockquote>
        What the A16Z graph shows is the rapid reduction in cost per token of <i>each specific model</i>, but also the rapid pace at which each specific model is supplanted by a better successor. Ding notes that users want the <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">current best model</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        gpt-3.5 is 10x cheaper than it was. it's also as desirable as a flip phone at an iphone launch.<br />
        <br />
        when a new model is released as the SOTA, 99% of the demand immediatley shifts over to it. consumers expect this of their products as well.

        Which causes the first of the two problems Ding is describing. His graph shows that the cost per token of the model users actually want is <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">approximately constant</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        the 10x cost reduction is real, but only for models that might as well be running on a commodore 64.<br />
        <br />
        so this is the first faulty pillar of the ‚Äúcosts will drop‚Äù strategy: demand exists for "the best language model," period. and the best model always costs about the same, because that's what the edge of inference costs today.<br />
        ...<br />
        when you're spending time with an ai‚Äîwhether coding, writing, or thinking‚Äîyou always max out on quality. nobody opens claude and thinks, "you know what? let me use the shitty version to save my boss some money." we're cognitively greedy creatures. we want the best brain we can get, especially if we‚Äôre balancing the other side with our time.
        </blockquote>
        So the business model based on the cost of inference dropping 10x per year doesn't work. But that isn't the worst of the two problems. While it is true that the cost in dollars of a set number of tokens is roughly constant, the number of tokens a user needs <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">is not</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        while it's true each generation of frontier model didn't get more expensive per token, something else happened. something worse. the number of tokens they consumed went absolutely nuclear.<br />
        <br />
        chatgpt used to reply to a one sentence question with a one sentence reply. now deep research will spend 3 minutes planning, and 20 minutes reading, and another 5 minutes re-writing a report for you while o3 will just run for 20-minutes to answer ‚Äúhello there‚Äù.<br />
        <br />
        the explosion of rl and test-time compute has resulted in something nobody saw coming: the length of a task that ai can complete has been doubling every six months. what used to return 1,000 tokens is now returning 100,000.

        Users started by trying fairly simpple tasks on fairly simple models. The power users, the ones in the 8%, were happy with the results and graduated to trying complex questions on frontier models. So their consumption of tokens <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">exploded</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        today, a 20-minute "deep research" run costs about $1. by 2027, we'll have agents that can run for 24 hours straight without losing the plot‚Ä¶ combine that with the static price of the frontier? that‚Äôs a ~$72 run. per day. per user. with the ability to run multiple asynchronously.<br />
        <br />
        once we can deploy agents to run workloads for 24 hours asynchronously, we won't be giving them one instruction and waiting for feedback. we'll be scheduling them in batches. entire fleets of ai workers, attacking problems in parallel, burning tokens like it's 1999.<br />
        <br />
        obviously - and i cannot stress this enough - a $20/month subscription cannot even support a user making a single $1 deep research run a day. but that's exactly what we're racing toward. every improvement in model capability is an improvement in how much compute they can meaningfully consume at a time.
        </blockquote>
        The power users were on Anthropic's unlimited plan, so <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">this happened</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        users became api orchestrators running 24/7 code transformation engines on anthropic's dime. the evolution from chat to agent happened overnight. 1000x increase in consumption. phase transition, not gradual change.<br />
        <br />
        so anthropic rolled back unlimited. they could've tried $2000/month, but the lesson isn't that they didn't charge enough, it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs no way to offer unlimited usage in this new world under any subscription model.<br />
        <br />
        it's that <b>there is no flat subscription price that works in this new world</b>.
        </blockquote>
        Ed Zitron's <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/"><i>AI Is A Money Trap</i></a> looks at the effect of Anthropic figuring this out on Cursor:<br />
        <blockquote>
        the single-highest earning generative AI company that isn‚Äôt called OpenAI or Anthropic, and the highest-earning company built on top of (primarily) Anthopic‚Äôs technology.
        </blockquote>
        When Anthropic decided to reduce the rate at which they were losing money, Cursor's <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/">business model collapsed</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        In mid-June ‚Äî a few weeks after Anthropic introduced ‚Äú<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/service-tiers">priority tiers</a>‚Äù that required companies to pay up-front and guarantee a certain throughput of tokens and increased costs on using prompt caching, a big part of AI coding ‚Äî <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/">Cursor massively changed the amount its users could use the product, and introduced a $200-a-month subscription</a>.<br />
        </blockquote>
        Cursor's customers <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/">weren't happy</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Cursor‚Äôs product is now worse. People are going to cancel their subscriptions. Its annualized revenue will drop, and its ability to raise capital will suffer as a direct result. It will, regardless of this drop in revenue, have to pay the cloud companies what it owes them, as if it had the business it used to. I have spoken to a few different people, including a company with an enterprise contract, that are either planning to cancel or trying to find a way out of their agreements with Cursor.
        </blockquote>
        So Cursor, which was already losing money, will have less income and higher costs. They are the largest company buit on the AI major's platforms, despite only earning "around $42 million a month", and Anthropic just showed that their business model doesn't work. This isn't a good sign for the generative AI industry and thus, as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/">Zitron explains in details</a>, for the persistence of the AI bubble.<br />

        Ding explains why OpenAi's $1/year/agency deal is all about with similar deals at the <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed">big banks</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        this is what devins all in on. they‚Äôve recently announced their citi and goldman sachs parterships, deploying devin to 40,000 software engineers at each company. at $20/mo this is a $10M project, but here‚Äôs a question: would you rather have $10M of ARR from goldman sachs or $500m from prosumer devleopers?<br />
        <br />
        the answer is obvious: six-month implementations, compliance reviews, security audits, procurement hell mean that that goldman sachs revenue is hard to win ‚Äî but once you win it it‚Äôs impossible to churn. you only get those contracts if the singular decision maker at the bank is staking their reputation on you ‚Äî and everyone will do everything they can to make it work.<br />

        <blockquote>
        The US IT jobs market hasn't exactly been robust thus far in 2025, and downward revisions to May and June's Bureau of Labor Statistics data mean IT jobs lost in July are part of an even deeper sector slowdown than previously believed.<br />
        <br />
        The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported relatively flat job growth last month, but unimpressive payroll growth numbers hid an even deeper reason to be worried: Most of the job growth <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">reported</a> (across all employment sectors) in May and June was incorrect. <br />
        <br />
        According to the BLS, May needed to be revised down by 125,000 jobs to just 19,000 added jobs; June had to be revised down by even more, with 133,000 erroneous new jobs added to company payrolls that month. That meant just 14,000 new jobs were added in June.<br />
        ...<br />
        Against that backdrop, Janco reports that BLS data peg the IT-sector unemployment rate at 5.5 percent in July - well above the national rate of 4.2 percent. Meanwhile, the broader tech occupation unemployment rate was just 2.9 percent, as reported by CompTIA. 
        </blockquote>
        Note these points from Janco's table:<br />
        <ul>
        <li>The huge spike of 107,100 IT jobs lost last November.</li>
        <li>The loss of 26,500 IT jobs so far this year.</li>
        <li>That so far this year losses are 327% of the same period last year.</li>

        CEOs have been enthusiastically laying off expensive workers and replacing them with much cheaper indentured servnts on H-1B visas, as Dan Gooding reports in <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/h1b-visa-immigrants-tech-jobs-impact-college-grads-2106392"><i>H-1B Visas Under Scrutiny as Big Tech Accelerates Layoffs</i></a>:<br />

Some 80,000 tech jobs have been eliminated so far this year, according to the tracker Layoffs.fyi.
        </blockquote>
        Gooding <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/h1b-visa-immigrants-tech-jobs-impact-college-grads-2106392">notes that</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        In 2023, U.S. colleges graduated 134,153 citizens or green card holders with bachelor's or master's degrees in computer science. But the same year, the federal government also issued over 110,000 work visas for those in that same field, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (IFSPP).<br />
        <br />
        "The story of the H-1B program is that it's for the best and the brightest," said Jeremy Beck, co-president of NumbersUSA, a think tank calling for immigration reform. "The reality, however, is that most H-1B workers are classified and paid as 'entry level.' Either they are not the best and brightest or they are underpaid, or both."

        While it is highly likely that most CEOs have drunk the Kool-Aid and actually believe that AI will replace the workers they fired, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lizthegrey.com/post/3lvkvyf3euc2u">Liz Fong-Jones</a> believes that:<br />
        <blockquote>
        the megacorps use AI as pretext for layoffs, but actually rooted in end of 0% interest, changes to R&amp;D tax credit (S174, h/t <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3y5mmnrkhxkv37szj7twlc6n">@pragmaticengineer.com</a> for their reporting), &amp; herd mentality/labour market fixing. they want investors to believe AI is driving cost efficiency.<br />
        <br />
        AI today is literally not capable of replacing the senior engineers they are laying off. corps are in fact getting less done, but they're banking on making an example of enough people that survivors put their heads down and help them implement AI in exchange for keeping their jobs... for now.
        </blockquote>
        Note that the megacorps are monopolies, so "getting less done" and delivering worse product by using AI isn't a problem for them ‚Äî they won't lose business. It is just more enshittification.<br />
        <br />
        Presumably, most CEOs think they have been laying off the fat, and replacing it with cheaper workers whose muscle is enhanced by AI, thereby pumping the stock. But they can't keep doing this; they'd end up with C-suite surrounded by short-termers on H-1Bs with no institutional memory of how the company actually functions. This information would have fallen off the end of the AIs' context.<br />
        <h3>The deleterious effects kick in</h3>
        The deleterious effects come in three forms.
        Within the companies, as the hype about AI's capabilities meets reality.  For the workers, and not just those who were laid off.  And in the broader economy, as the rush to build AI data centers meets limited resources.<br />
        <h4>The companies</h4>
        But Raval sees the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04a83e0d-0128-4f59-9835-cb434a4257ec">weakening starting</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        But are leaner organisations necessarily better ones? I am not convinced these companies are more resilient even if they perform better financially. Faster decision making and lower overheads are great, but does this mean fewer resources for R&amp;D, legal functions or compliance? What about a company‚Äôs ability to withstand shocks ‚Äî from supply chain disruptions to employee turnover and dare I say it, runaway robots?<br />
        <br />
        Some companies such as Klarna have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-08/klarna-turns-from-ai-to-real-person-customer-service">reversed tack</a>, realising that firing hundreds of staff and relying on AI resulted in a poorer customer service experience. Now the payments group wants them back.<br />
        </blockquote>
        Of course, the tech majors have already enshittified their customer experience, so they can impose AI on their customers without fear. But AI is enshittifying the customer experience of smaller companies who have acutal competitors.<br />
        <h4>The workers</h4>
        Shannon Pettypiece reports that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/job-market-report-college-student-graduates-ai-trump-tariffs-rcna221693"><i>'A black hole': New graduates discover a dismal job market</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        NBC News asked people who recently finished technical school, college or graduate school how their job application process was going, and in more than 100 responses, the graduates described months spent searching for a job, hundreds of applications and zero responses from employers ‚Äî even with degrees once thought to be in high demand, like computer science or engineering. Some said they struggled to get an hourly retail position or are making salaries well below what they had been expecting in fields they hadn‚Äôt planned to work in.
        </blockquote>
        And Anjli Raval note that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04a83e0d-0128-4f59-9835-cb434a4257ec"><i>The AI job cuts are accelerating</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Younger workers should be particularly concerned about this trend. Entire rungs on the career ladder are taking a hit, undermining traditional job pathways. This is not only about AI of course. Offshoring, post-Covid budget discipline, and years of underwhelming growth have made entry-level hiring an easy thing to cut. But AI is adding to pressures.<br />
        ...<br />
        The consequences are cultural as well as economic. If jobs aren‚Äôt readily available, will a university degree retain its value? Careers already are increasingly ‚Äú<a href="https://www.amazingif.com/">squiggly</a>‚Äù and not linear. The rise of freelancing and hiring of contractors has already fragmented the nature of work in many cases. AI will only propel this. <br />
        ...<br />
        The tech bros touting people-light companies underestimate the complexity of business operations and corporate cultures that are built on very human relationships and interactions. In fact, while AI can indeed handle the tedium, there should be a new premium on the human ‚Äî from creativity and emotional intelligence to complex judgment. But that can only happen if we invest in those who bring those qualities and teach the next generation of workers ‚Äî and right now, the door is closing on many of them.

        In <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34071"><i>Rising Young Worker Despair in the United States</i></a>,  David G. Blanchflower &amp; Alex Bryson describe some of the consequences:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Between the early 1990s and 2015 the relationship between mental despair and age was hump-shaped in the United States: it rose to middle-age, then declined later in life. That relationship has now changed: mental despair declines monotonically with age due to a rise in despair among the young. However, the relationship between age and mental despair differs by labor market status. The hump-shape in age still exists for those who are unable to work and the unemployed. The relation between mental despair and age is broadly flat, and has remained so, for homemakers, students and the retired. The change in the age-despair profile over time is due to increasing despair among young workers. Whilst the relationship between mental despair and age has always been downward sloping among workers, this relationship has become more pronounced due to a rise in mental despair among young workers. We find broad-based evidence for this finding in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of 1993-2023, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2008-2023, and in surveys by Pew, the Conference Board and Johns Hopkins University.
        </blockquote>
        History tends to show that large numbers of jobless young people despairing of their prospects for the future is a pre-revolutionary situation.<br />

        <blockquote>
        The entire high-yield bond market is only valued at about $1.4tn, so private credit investors putting in $800bn for data centre construction would be huge. A predicted $150bn of ABS and CMBS issuance backed by data centre cash flows would triple those markets‚Äô current size. Hyperscaler funding of $300bn to $400bn a year compares with annual capex last year for <i>all S&amp;P 500 companies</i> of about $950bn.<br />
        <br />
        It‚Äôs also worth breaking down where the money would be spent. Morgan Stanley estimates that $1.3tn of data centre capex will pay for land, buildings and fit-out expenses. The remaining $1.6tn is to buy GPUs from Nvidia and others. Smarter people than us can work out how to securitise an asset <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a96d65c1-8ba7-4055-b952-61c5b5d500fc">that loses 30 per cent of its value every year</a>, and good luck to them.
        </blockquote>
        Brian Merchant argues that this spending is so big it is offsetting the impact of the tariffs in <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-bubble-is-so-big-its-propping"><i>The AI bubble is so big it's propping up the US economy (for now)</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Over the last six months, capital expenditures on AI‚Äîcounting just information processing equipment and software, by the way‚Äîadded more to the growth of the US economy than all consumer spending combined. You can just pull any of those quotes out‚Äîspending on IT for AI is so big it might be making up for economic losses from the tariffs, serving as a <i>private sector stimulus program</i>.

        Over-investment is back, but might this be a <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">good thing?</a><br />
        <blockquote>
        I think it‚Äôs important to look at the telecom boom of the 1990s rather than the one in the 2010s, because the former led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecoms_crash">a gigantic crash</a>. The railroad boom led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1873">a gigantic crash too</a>, in 1873 ... In both cases, companies built too much infrastructure, outrunning growth in demand for that infrastructure, and suffered a devastating bust as expectations reset and loans couldn‚Äôt be paid back.<br />
        <br />
        In both cases, though, the big capex spenders weren‚Äôt <i>wrong</i>, they were just <i>early</i>. Eventually, we ended up using all of those railroads and all of those telecom fibers, and much more. This has led a lot of people <a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2021/01/why-bubbles-are-good-for-innovation/">to speculate</a> that big investment bubbles might actually be <a href="https://slate.com/business/2007/05/why-bubbles-are-great-for-the-economy.html">beneficial to the economy</a>, since manias leave behind a surplus of cheap infrastructure that can be used to power future technological advances and new business models.<br />
        <br />
        But for anyone who gets caught up in the crash, the future benefits to society are of cold comfort.

        How likely is the bubble to burst? Elder notes just <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce">one reason</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Morgan Stanley estimates that more than half of the new data centres will be in the US, where there‚Äôs no obvious way yet to switch them on:<br />
        <br />
        America needs to find an extra 45GW for its data farms, says Morgan Stanley. That‚Äôs equivalent to about 10 per cent of all current US generation capacity, or ‚Äú23 Hoover Dams‚Äù, it says. Proposed workarounds to meet the shortfall include scrapping crypto mining, putting data centres ‚Äúbehind the meter‚Äù in nuclear power plants, and building a new fleet of gas-fired generators.
        </blockquote>
        Good luck with that! It is worth noting that the crash has <i>already happened in China</i>, as Caiwei Chen reports in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/26/1113802/china-ai-data-centers-unused/"><i>China built hundreds of AI data centers to catch the AI boom. Now many stand unused.</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        Just months ago, a boom in data center construction was at its height, fueled by both government and private investors. However, many newly built facilities are now sitting empty. According to people on the ground who spoke to <i>MIT Technology Review</i>‚Äîincluding contractors, an executive at a GPU server company, and project managers‚Äîmost of the companies running these data centers are struggling to stay afloat. The local Chinese outlets <i>Jiazi Guangnian</i> and <i>36Kr</i> report that up to 80% of China‚Äôs newly built computing resources remain unused.
        </blockquote>
        Elder also uses the analogy with the late 90s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7052c560-4f31-4f45-bed0-cbc84453b3ce">telecom bubble</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        In 2000, at the telecoms bubble‚Äôs peak, communications equipment spending topped out at <a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/RichmondFedOrg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2003/fall/pdf/wolman.pdf">$135bn annualised</a>. The internet hasn‚Äôt disappeared, but <a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/a-telecoms-bubble-or-a-tech-bubble">most of the money did</a>. All those 3G licences and fibre-optic city loops provided zero insulation from default:<br />
        <br />
        Peak data centre spend this time around might be 10 times higher, very approximately, with public credit investors sharing the burden more equally with corporates. The broader spread of capital might mean a slower unwind should GenAI‚Äôs return on investment fail to meet expectations, as Morgan Stanley says. But it‚Äôs still not obvious why creditors would be coveting a server shed full of obsolete GPUs that‚Äôs downwind of a proposed power plant. 
        </blockquote>
        When the bubble bursts, who will <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">lose money?</a><br />
        <blockquote>
        A data center bust would mean that Big Tech shareholders would lose a lot of money, like dot-com shareholders in 2000. It would also slow the economy directly, because Big Tech companies would stop investing. But the scariest possibility is that it would cause a financial crisis.<br />
        <br />
        Financial crises tend to involve bank debt. When a financial bubble and crash is mostly a fall in the value of stocks and bonds, everyone takes losses and then just sort of walks away, a bit poorer ‚Äî like in 2000. Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2015) survey the history of bubbles and crashes, and they find that debt (also called ‚Äúcredit‚Äù and ‚Äúleverage‚Äù) is a key predictor of whether a bubble ends up hurting the real economy.
        </blockquote>
        The Jorda <i>et al</i> paper is <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/wp11-27bk.pdf"><i>When Credit Bites Back: Leverage, Business Cycles, and Crises</i></a>, and what they mean by "credit" and "leverage" is <i>bank loans</i>.<br />
        <br />
        Smith looks at whether <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">the banks are lending</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        So if we believe this basic story of when to be afraid of capex busts, it means that we have to care about who is lending money to these Big Tech companies to build all these data centers. That way, we can figure out whether we‚Äôre worried about what happens to those lenders if Big Tech can‚Äôt pay the money back.
        </blockquote>
        And so does <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/07/31/who-will-pay-for-the-trillion-dollar-ai-boom"><i>The Economist</i></a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        During the first half of the year investment-grade borrowing by tech firms was 70% higher than in the first six months of 2024. In April Alphabet issued bonds for the first time since 2020. Microsoft has reduced its cash pile but its finance leases‚Äîa type of debt mostly related to data centres‚Äînearly tripled since 2023, to $46bn (a further $93bn of such liabilities are not yet on its balance-sheet). Meta is in talks to borrow around $30bn from private-credit lenders including Apollo, Brookfield and Carlyle. The market for debt securities backed by borrowing related to data centres, where liabilities are pooled and sliced up in a way similar to mortgage bonds, has grown from almost nothing in 2018 to around $50bn today.<br />
        <br />
        The rush to borrow is more furious among big tech‚Äôs challengers. CoreWeave, an ai cloud firm, has borrowed liberally from private-credit funds and bond investors to buy chips from Nvidia. Fluidstack, another cloud-computing startup, is also borrowing heavily, using its chips as collateral. SoftBank, a Japanese firm, is financing its share of a giant partnership with Openai, the maker of ChatGPT, with debt. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt actually have the money,‚Äù wrote Elon Musk when the partnership was announced in January. After raising $5bn of debt earlier this year xai, Mr Musk‚Äôs own startup, is reportedly borrowing $12bn to buy chips.
        </blockquote>
        Smith focuses on <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">private credit</a>:<br />
        <blockquote>
        These are the potentially scary part. Private credit funds are basically companies that take investment, borrow money, and then lend that money out in private (i.e. opaque) markets. They‚Äôre the debt version of private equity, and in recent years they‚Äôve grown rapidly to become one of the U.S.‚Äô economy‚Äôs major categories of debt:

        Are the banks vulnerable to <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy">private credit?</a>.<br />
        <blockquote>
        Private credit funds take some of their financing as equity, but they also borrow money. Some of this money is borrowed from banks. In 2013, only 1% of U.S. banks‚Äô total loans to non-bank financial institutions was to private equity and private credit firms; <a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/supervisory-research-and-analysis-notes/2025/bank-lending-to-private-equity-and-private-credit-funds.aspx">today, it‚Äôs 14%</a>.<br />
        <br />
        BDCs are ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Development_Company">Business Development Companies</a>‚Äù, which are a type of private credit fund. If there‚Äôs a bust in private credit, that‚Äôs an acronym you‚Äôll be hearing a lot.<br />
        <br />
        And I believe the graph above does not include <a href="https://www.wellington.com/en-us/institutional/insights/clos-four-hot-topics-for-2024">bank purchases of bonds (CLOs)</a> issued by private credit companies. If private credit goes bust, those bank assets will go bust too, making banks‚Äô balance sheets weaker.
        </blockquote>
        The fundamental problem here is that an AI bust would cause losses that would be both very large and very highly correlated, and thus very likely to be a tail risk not adequately accounted for by the banks' risk models, just as the large, highly correlated losses caused the banks to need a bail-out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis">Global Financial Crisis</a> of 2008.<br />

      <title>Underlines and line height</title>
      <link>https://adactio.com/journal/22085</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I was thinking about something I wrote yesterday when I was talking about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22084">styling underlines on links</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>For a start, you can adjust the distance of the underline from the text using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset"><code>text-underline-offset</code></a>. If you‚Äôre using a generous line-height, use a generous distance here too.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>For some reason, I completely forgot that we‚Äôve got a line-height unit in CSS now: <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_length_lh"><code>lh</code></a>. So if you want to make the distance of your underline proportional to the line height of the text that the link is part of, it‚Äôs easy-peasy:</p>
        
        <pre><code>text-underline-offset: 0.15lh;
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>The greater the line height, the greater the distance between the link text and its underline.</p>
        
        <p>I think this one is going into <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21896">my collection of CSS snippets</a> I use on almost every project.</p>]]>

      <title>Choosing Tools To Make Websites</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/choosing-tools-for-making-websites/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Jan Miksovsky lays out his idea for <a href="https://goodinternetmagazine.com/site-creation-as-content-transformation/" >website creation as content transformation</a>. He starts by talking about tools that hide what‚Äôs happening ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>A framework‚Äôs marketing usually pretends it is unnecessary for you to understand how its core transformation works ‚Äî but without that knowledge, you can‚Äôt achieve the beautiful range of results you see in the framework‚Äôs sample site gallery.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is a <em>great</em> callout. Tools will say, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to worry about the details.‚Äù But the reality is, you end up worrying about the details ‚Äî at least to some degree.</p>
        <p>Why? Because what you want to build is full of personalization. That‚Äôs how you differentiate yourself, which means you‚Äôre going to need a tool that‚Äôs expressive enough to help you.</p>
        <p>So the question becomes: how hard is it to understand the details that are being intentionally hidden away?</p>
        <p>A lot of the time those details are not exposed directly. Instead they‚Äôre exposed through configuration. But configuration doesn‚Äôt really help you learn how something works. I mean, how many of you have learned how typescript works under the hood by using <code>tsconfig.json</code>? As Jan says:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Configuration can lead to as many problems as it solves</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Nailed it. He continues:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Configuring software is itself a form of programming, in fact a rather difficult and often baroque form. It can take more data files or code to configure a framework‚Äôs transformation than to write a program that directly implements that transformation itself.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I‚Äôm not a Devops person, but that sounds like Devops in a nutshell right there. (It also perfectly encapsulates my feelings on trying to setup configuration in GitHub Actions.)</p>
        <p>Jan moves beyond site creation to also discuss site hosting. He gives good reasons for keeping your website‚Äôs architecture simple and decoupled from your hosting provider (something I‚Äôve been a long time proponent of):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>These site hosting platforms typically charge an ongoing subscription fee. (Some offer a free tier that may meet your needs.) The monthly fee may not be large, but it‚Äôs forever. Ten years from now you‚Äôll probably still want your content to be publicly available, but will you still be happy paying that monthly fee? If you stop paying, your site disappears.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In subscription pricing, any price (however small) is recurring. Stated differently: pricing is forever.</p>
        <p>Anyhow, it‚Äôs a good read from Jan and lays out his vision for why he‚Äôs building <a href="https://weborigami.org" >Web Origami</a>: a tool for that encourages you to understand (and customize) how you transform content to a website. He just launched <a href="https://github.com/WebOrigami/origami/releases/tag/0.4.0" >version <code>0.4.0</code> </a> which has some exciting stuff I‚Äôm excited to try out further (I‚Äôll have to write about all that later).</p>

      <title>Style your underlines</title>
      <link>https://adactio.com/journal/22084</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We shouldn‚Äôt rely on colour alone to indicate that something is interactive.</p>
        
        <p>Take links, for example. Sure, you can give them a different colour to the surrounding text, but you shouldn‚Äôt stop there. Make sure there‚Äôs something else that distinguishes them. You could make them bold. Or you could stick with the well-understood convention of underlying links.</p>
        
        <p>This is where some designers bristle. If there are a lot of links on a page, it could look awfully cluttered with underlines. That&#8217;s why some designers would rather remove the underline completely.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@matuzo@front-end.social/114674911039663634">As Manu observed</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>I&#8217;ve done a lot of audits in the first half of this year and at this point a believe that designing links without underlines is a kink. The idea that users don&#8217;t understand that links are clickable arouses some designers. I can&#8217;t explain it any other way.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>But underlining links isn&#8217;t the binary decision it once was. You can use CSS to style those underlines just as you‚Äôd style any other part of your design language.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline">Here‚Äôs a regular underlined link.</a></p>
        
        <p>For a start, you can adjust the distance of the underline from the text using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset"><code>text-underline-offset</code></a>. If you&#8217;re using a generous line-height, use a generous distance here too.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em">Here‚Äôs a link with an offset underline.</a></p>
        
        <p>If you‚Äôd rather have a thinner or thicker underline, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-thickness"><code>text-decoration-thickness</code></a>.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px">Here‚Äôs a link with a thin underline.</a></p>
        
        <p>The colour of the underline and the colour of the link don&#8217;t need to be the same. Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-color"><code>text-decoration-color</code></a> to make them completely different colours or make the underline a lighter shade of the link colour.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%);">Here‚Äôs a link with a translucent underline.</a></p>
        
        <p>That‚Äôs quite a difference with just a few CSS declarations:</p>
        
        <pre><code>text-underline-offset: 0.2em;
        text-decoration-thickness: 1px;
        text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%);
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>If that still isn‚Äôt subtle enough for you, you could even use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-style"><code>text-decoration-style</code></a> to make the underline dotted or dashed, but that might be a step too far.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://example.com/" style="all: revert; font-size: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 0.2em; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-decoration-color: oklch(from currentColor l c h / 50%); text-decoration-style: dotted">Here‚Äôs a link with a dotted underline.</a></p>
        
        <p>Whatever you decide, I hope you&#8217;ll see that underlines aren‚Äôt the enemy of good design. They&#8217;re an opportunity.</p>
        
        <p>You should use underlines to keep your links accessible. But you should also use CSS to make those underlines beautiful.</p>]]>

I don't think I've ever said that on the blog before. I write my code in an outliner, and take advantage of its ability to collapse long comments into a single line. There are whole blogs at the top of some functions, notes about all the big changes in code, sometimes over years, and sometimes even decades of maintenance.  There's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/source.opml">source.opml</a> in most of the repos with a big comment at the top explaining what's going on. Also, most projects have a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a> file, and where there are dates in the source code, the refer back to dates in the worknotes.md file. Not always, but most of the time. Some of the code is very complex, I work really hard to make it simple so it can be worked on, but in some cases it's impossible to make it read casually. But it's all there, all the tools I use to write the code.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[With the fate of Goo.gl in the balance and many URL shortening/redirection services being either expensive or spammy, I wondered if I could find a free/cheap way of achieving the same. So I got myself a short domain (CLXI.org) and looked at using a GitHub repo with pages to redirect URLs. Turns out, this is [&#8230;]]]>

      <title>Sit On Your Ass Web Development</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/sit-on-your-ass-web-dev/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôve been <del>reading</del> listening to <a href="https://press.stripe.com/poor-charlies-almanack" ><em>Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanack</em></a> which is a compilation of talks by Charlie Munger, legendary vice-chairman at Berkshire Hathaway.</p>
        <p>One thing Charlie talks about is what he calls ‚Äúsit on your ass investing‚Äù which is the opposite of day trading. Rather than being in the market every day (chasing trends, reacting to fluctuations, and trying to time transactions) Charlie advocates spending most of your time ‚Äúsitting on your ass‚Äù. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre doing nothing. It means that instead of constantly trading you‚Äôre spending your time in research and preparation for trading.</p>
        <p>Eventually, a top-tier opportunity will come along and your preparation will make you capable of recognizing it and betting big. <em>That‚Äôs when you trade.</em> After that, you‚Äôre back to ‚Äúsitting on your ass‚Äù. Trust your research. Trust your choices. Don‚Äôt tinker. Don‚Äôt micromanage. Don‚Äôt panic. Just let the compounding effects of a good choice work in your favor.</p>
        <h2 id="day-trading-day-developing">Day Trading, Day Developing</h2>
        <p>As a day trader your job is to trade daily (it‚Äôs right there in the job title). If you‚Äôre not trading every day then what are you even doing? Not your job, apparently.</p>
        <p>I think it‚Äôs easy to view ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù like this. You‚Äôre a developer. Your job is to develop programs ‚Äî to write code. If you‚Äôre not doing that every single day, then what are you even doing?</p>
        <p>From this perspective, it becomes easy to think that writing endless code for ever-changing software paradigms is just how one develops websites.</p>
        <p>But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Granted, <a href="https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/" >there‚Äôs cold-blooded and warm-blooded software.</a> Sometimes you can‚Äôt avoid that.</p>
        <p>But I also think there‚Äôs a valuable lesson in Charlie‚Äôs insight.   You don‚Äôt have to chase ‚Äúthe market‚Äù of every new framework or API, writing endless glue code for features that already exist or that will soon exist in browsers. Instead, you can make a few select, large bets on the web platform and then ‚Äúsit on your ass‚Äù until the payoff comes later!</p>
        <h2 id="an-example-polyfills">An Example: Polyfills</h2>
        <p>I think polyfills are a great example of an approach to ‚Äúsit on your ass‚Äù web development. Your job as a developer is to know enough to make a bet on a particular polyfill that aligns with the future of the web platform. Once implemented, all you have to do is sit on your ass while other really smart people who are building browsers do their part to ship the polyfilled feature in the platform. Once shipped, you ‚Äúsell‚Äù your investment by stripping out the polyfill and reap the reward of having your application get lighter and faster with zero additional effort.</p>
        <p>A big part of the payoff is in the waiting ‚Äî in the ‚Äúsitting on your ass‚Äù. You make a smart bet, then you sit patiently while others run around endlessly writing and rewriting more code (meanwhile the only thing left for you will be to delete code).</p>
        <p>Charlie‚Äôs business partner Warren Buffett once said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price‚Äù. Similarly, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs better to build on a polyfill aligned with the future of the platform than to build on a framework re-inventing a feature of the platform.</p>
        <h2 id="get-out-of-your-own-way">Get Out Of Your Own Way</h2>
        <p>Want to do ‚ÄúDay Trading Development‚Äù?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Jump tools and frameworks constantly ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe next one will solve all our problems!‚Äù</li>
        <li>Build complex, custom solutions that duplicate work the web  platform is already moving towards solving.</li>
        <li>Commit code that churns with time, rather than compounds with it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Want to do ‚ÄúSit on Your Ass Development‚Äù?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Do the minimum necessary to bridge the gap until browsers catch up.</li>
        <li>Build on forward-facing standards, then sit back and leverage the compounding effects of browser makers and standards bodies that iteratively improve year over year (none of whom you have to pay).</li>
        <li>As <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-07-18T0946" >Alex Russel recommends</a>, spend as little time as possible in your own code and instead focus on glueing together ‚Äúthe big C++/Rust subsystems‚Äù of the browser.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short: spend less time glueing together tools and frameworks <em>on top of</em> the browser, and more time bridging tools and APIs <em>inside of the browser</em>. Then get out of your own way and go sit on your ass. You might find yourself more productive than ever!</p>
        <h2 id="update-2025-08-11">Update: 2025-08-11</h2>
        <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davatron5000.bsky.social/post/3lw4vg2eo7k2w" >Dave Rupert mentioned</a> which web platform features he‚Äôs jumping on the bandwagon for:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>view transitions</li>
        <li>scroll-driven animations</li>
        <li>popover</li>
        <li>masonry</li>
        <li>web components</li>
        <li>carousels</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And I would add to that my own (at the time of this writing):</p>
        <ul>
        <li>http imports / importmaps</li>
        <li>css / json modules</li>
        <li>URLPattern</li>
        <li>css nesting</li>
        <li>relative color syntax</li>
        <li>HTML INCLUDES!</li>
        </ul>
